__label__joy	No ! I am on my way to the reserve room . Thanks again !
__label__joy	thanks . Cheers .
__label__joy	Great idea . But the fact is we have no barbecue with us . Moreover , the sashimi will be great . So why do we bother to waste time on barbecuing the fish ?
__label__joy	That ’ s great . You ’ re a lifesaver .
__label__surprise	I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?
__label__surprise	Really ? well , ok , you're welcome .
__label__sadness	I can't . I am really behind of my work .
__label__joy	Thanks . I'll need a while to choose . Could you come back in a minute ?
__label__joy	Let's go .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry sir , but we are fully booked tonight until eight .
__label__joy	Such a lovely girl . I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday !
__label__joy	Of course .
__label__joy	That sounds good . It will give my wife a chance to dress up .
__label__surprise	What's the occasion ? You won the lottery ?
__label__joy	Yeah , but so what ! I ’ m proud to live in the world ’ s most exciting city . And , the salaries here are the highest in the nation , too .
__label__surprise	How amazing !
__label__surprise	You must be joking . Those two ?
__label__joy	I love it . It's so festive ! And where did you get that cup ? It's got the same logo as the car .
__label__joy	You bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight .
__label__joy	Oh , sorry , sir.We take no tips here.Thank you all the same .
__label__joy	Perfect . Thank you , goodbye !
__label__joy	Yeah , and meet other drivers of the same car !
__label__joy	It was good to see you here , John .
__label__joy	Sure . I thought people only showed off pictures of their new babies , not new pets !
__label__surprise	but surely they won't fire you ! You're one of the most experienced managers here !
__label__joy	What good sunshine ! Let's go and get a suntan on the balcony .
__label__joy	You must have a wonderful time .
__label__joy	Great . I would like that .
__label__joy	Right , a disco is a place where people dance according to nonstop recorded music ...
__label__joy	Yeah , I guess I did . They're going to buy invoking ?
__label__joy	I am glad you are happy .
__label__joy	And I'm glad to meet you , too .
__label__joy	It's a good idea . But where can we donate money ?
__label__joy	I trust you . We'll be happy .
__label__joy	Yes , I suppose we must . I have enjoyed all these days that you have spent with me , and I'll always remember them . I've learned a lot from you . Thank you for all your kindness .
__label__joy	That's terrific . Thank you .
__label__joy	I'm so glad to meet you .
__label__joy	My sister did it . When did you get yours cut ?
__label__joy	I'd be glad to .
__label__joy	I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing !
__label__sadness	No .
__label__joy	Yes , let's get something to eat .
__label__anger	Trust you ! You can't even handle simple plane reservations !
__label__anger	to be honest , I'm a bit fed up .
__label__joy	That would be a definite bonus .
__label__joy	That ’ s a good idea .
__label__joy	I suppose this song can be the No . 1 on the top chart .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Right , she is so excited and simply can ’ t wait .
__label__joy	See you !
__label__sadness	Oh , my God ! I feel nothing is going smooth .
__label__surprise	Oh really ? Is he all right ?
__label__joy	OK . I'll take it . Thank you .
__label__joy	Well , I love it . The room is spacious and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place !
__label__joy	I ’ m happy to meet you . It seems everyone in town is so friendly .
__label__sadness	I'm afraid I can only rent it for two months .
__label__joy	That will be six dollars . Out of ten-seven , eight , nine , ten . Thank you .
__label__joy	I'll show you how . The bar tenders know whose turn it is . And also , I can snap my fingers to catch his attention .
__label__joy	Oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , I'll always be there .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__surprise	Oh , I see him now . Wait ! That's ...
__label__joy	Later this month . I can't wait !
__label__sadness	Sorry again for bothering you .
__label__joy	Good . Thank you.sir .
__label__joy	OK . If you really insist , I could always use the company .
__label__joy	No , thanks .
__label__joy	Yes . I thought it was excellent . Didn't you ?
__label__sadness	I am sorry , sir . You bought it 2 weeks ago , and you can only refund it in one week .
__label__joy	I don't know . I think the woman was better . She provided a good love interest . Lucky James Bond !
__label__joy	I liked it . I thought it was great .
__label__joy	Well , you are lucky to have such a considerate husband . Mine hasn't brought me a single rose since we married .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , sir .
__label__joy	Thanks , this is a fine party . We should have a drink together to celebrate your birthday
__label__joy	And here's her signature !
__label__sadness	I ’ m afraid I ’ m already booked up for next Sunday . But thank you just the same .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__sadness	I don ’ t know what happened to me . I just lost it .
__label__joy	David , would you like something to eat ?
__label__joy	Thanks . Some tea would be nice . Chinese tea is great . I really like your tea set . Where did you get it ?
__label__joy	The music has started .
__label__joy	Sure , you ’ re more than welcome . I ’ m meeting everyone at three o ’ clock .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__sadness	Oh , poor Alan ! His sister is the only one he has left since his parents died last year .
__label__joy	If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book .
__label__joy	Yes , I usually develop and print all my own photos .
__label__joy	Playing tennis twice a week will be a good start . Count me in .
__label__joy	Whatever brought us together , I'm happy .
__label__joy	Thanks . I'll get back to you .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Hello baseball fans , and welcome back to today ’ s game ! My name is Rick Fields and of course , I am here , once again , with the man that seals the deal , Bob Copeland . '
__label__disgust	So they create viruses to tell people they are smart ? That's really sick .
__label__joy	I like him.He ' s good for her .
__label__joy	Yes , I did .
__label__anger	That maybe true , and I for one don ’ t want to see anyone lose their job , but how can these Ces ask for a bailout when they ’ re making millions of dollars ? And then , they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets ! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! And they ’ re asking for money ! That is just not right !
__label__fear	You think it's funny . I'm terrified .
__label__joy	Hello . I'm Jason .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	The park is so beautiful . It is a good thing I have taken the camera .
__label__joy	Thanks . It was very nice to meet you .
__label__joy	That sounds simple enough . It's Friday today , I'll be back on Monday morning , first thing , with all of the relevant data . See you then , and enjoy your weekend .
__label__joy	Mmm , that sounds very interesting .
__label__joy	Great ! We will send you all the details later . Looking forward to meeting with you !
__label__joy	Thank you !
__label__joy	She is beautiful .
__label__joy	I'm Mary . I want to say I really admire the software you're designed .
__label__joy	I suggest you take this book . It's very exciting .
__label__joy	How do you like Tom ?
__label__surprise	That's incredible ! She has such a sharp figure .
__label__sadness	Yeah , but nothing was clear during the test .
__label__joy	He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him .
__label__joy	Francis , you have done an outstanding work in the past six months . In view of your achievement , I trust you ’ re now indispensable part of our company and you deserve an officer director title .
__label__fear	I'm worried that everything will be chaotic !
__label__joy	Oh , my dear , how can I forget such an important day ? I was just kidding . Look at this box .
__label__joy	It has been a pleasure . Goodbye .
__label__joy	Because I am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world !
__label__joy	Thanks very much . There ’ s thirteen dollars .
__label__joy	Well then , I'll see you on Saturday . Thanks for asking me to go with you .

__label__joy	Hm , It looks nice , but I ’ d like to have something warm for the winter .
__label__surprise	How things have changed now !
__label__joy	I am sure it will be . It's been good so far this weekend .
__label__joy	Enjoy your stay .
__label__joy	Yes . And what dances do you like best ?
__label__surprise	You're kidding ! I can't believe you've been standing this entire time and didn't say anything .
__label__joy	I hope so .
__label__joy	You are welcome .
__label__joy	Yes , it is . How do you know that ?
__label__joy	Sure . Here you go .
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__joy	congratulations ! Which one is the cheapest ?
__label__anger	John , I ’ Ve asked you not to smoke in here ! I don ’ t want to see you smoking in my office again .
__label__joy	Hello , Steven . Congratulations !
__label__joy	I ’ ll be very glad if you would help .
__label__joy	Merry Christmas to you .
__label__joy	I really love their dancing . They are all excellent dancers .
__label__joy	Really ?
__label__joy	Thanks . Well , those two kids are beginners . What should I do about their safety ?
__label__joy	Yes , I received the scholarship 3 times on end .
__label__joy	That sounds great .

__label__joy	Yes , I did , thanks .
__label__joy	We really were lucky . We got the last available table for two---and we didn't even have a reservation ! Did you see the long lines behind us ?
__label__joy	thanks !
__label__joy	That is wonderful .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__sadness	it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed .
__label__joy	Yes . It's perfect .
__label__joy	Well , I hope you have a wonderful time on your library visits !
__label__joy	What a beautiful sweater !
__label__joy	Thank you for your advice . I ’ ll try it .
__label__joy	How about Bill's Seafood Restaurant ?
__label__surprise	You're going to kick me out over this ?
__label__joy	I appreciate it very much . You've been doing great . I expect to see you be promoted pretty soon .
__label__joy	If ever you ’ re in Chicago , please do look me up .
__label__joy	Sure . I think it ’ s a fantastic place to go .
__label__joy	Don't mention it .
__label__joy	It sounds interesting . Can I go and see it ?
__label__joy	Well , I'll try gin and tonic .
__label__joy	You are welcome .
__label__anger	Yes , me too . I think I ’ Ve lost some important clients recently because of this train !
__label__joy	I ’ m glad you are getting better .
__label__joy	You are welcome
__label__joy	Happy Valentine's Day !

__label__joy	Sounds good . I'll see you on Wednesday then .
__label__joy	I am glad you are here ! See if you can find the problem .
__label__joy	Yes , Thursday would be fine . What time shall I come ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much . I have been looking for it for a long time.Is this the latest edition ?
__label__joy	I have many hobbies . I like almost all kinds of sports and I also like to listen to classical music .
__label__joy	Here's your change . Thank you .
__label__joy	that sounds pretty easy . Do rabbits make your house smell ?
__label__joy	Fine , I'll be expecting you .
__label__joy	You ’ re right . I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . I would hate living in the country !
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome .
__label__joy	I ’ ll appreciate your help
__label__joy	Well , you are flattering me . I wouldn't say I am a professional , but I did receive some training at school . My music teacher used to be a professional singer .
__label__surprise	really ? Have you won a fortune in the lottery ?
__label__joy	I'm a big fan of Snoop Dog .
__label__joy	Yes , I ’ m feeling very well these days .
__label__joy	I see . Thank you .
__label__anger	I want to change rooms . In fact , I want a refund for tonight !

__label__joy	You came to the right place . Any particular decade ?
__label__joy	We ate a lot of things . We played games and gave gifts to Jessie . We had a lot of fun .
__label__joy	That's good !
__label__sadness	It's a huge headache . I have no idea what I want to do .
__label__joy	I'm going to see a musical . Would you like to come ?
__label__joy	You ’ re a real friend in need .
__label__disgust	What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ?
__label__fear	Steven , I ...
__label__joy	Hi ! Wang Mei.Come and have a look at my new dress .
__label__joy	I'm glad I was able to help .
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__surprise	Oh dear ! Where should I go from here ?
__label__joy	A glass of white wine would be fine , thank you .
__label__joy	Yeah . People always enjoy the lighted lanterns and the gala performances .
__label__joy	See you at 7
__label__joy	Sure.Where would you suggest ?
__label__joy	I see . Thank you .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	All right . Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	No . I haven ’ t had the pleasure .
__label__joy	Don't hurry . Wait for my call .
__label__joy	OK . Wait for a moment , please . I'll be back in a moment with the dishes .
__label__joy	Good idea . Shall we get everyone in the community ?
__label__joy	Oh , Tom ! They sound fantastic . I really like all those things .
__label__joy	Her lips ? The early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy .
__label__joy	It ’ s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products .
__label__joy	It looks delicious .
__label__joy	The ref signals the start of the game and here we go . Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball . Chen bumps it to the setter , and ... a very nice set by Chen !
__label__surprise	Really ? Too expensive . I don't think I can afford it .
__label__sadness	I told you I ’ m sorry . What can I do to make it up to you ?
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	I am so happy for them .
__label__joy	Based on your contribution , I would like to give you a pay raise . Your monthly salary will be increased by 800 Yuan . This increase includes an 80 % married increase based on your achievements and increase responsibilities and then the additional 20 % increase were reflecting the changes in cost of living .
__label__surprise	What are you talking about ? We had a great time . We laughed and talked all night last time .
__label__joy	Thank you . You're very kind .
__label__joy	It would be a rare occasion to be able to appreciate so many fine species of Chinese and foreign flowers fully blooming in one park !
__label__fear	Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick !
__label__joy	My absolutely favorite kind of pie is apple .
__label__surprise	I just thought I would ask .
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__joy	Right . Let's help each other .
__label__anger	Fine ! I can't believe you don't trust me .
__label__joy	It's very kind of you .
__label__sadness	Probably not . Doing that will probably take another three hours which I can't afford now .
__label__joy	You're right.The air is so warm and everything looks so fresh and green .
__label__joy	When did you learn to dance ?
__label__joy	Yeah . Have you made any good resolutions for this new year ?
__label__joy	Oh , that ’ s great . Thanks Grace . Can you give me her number ? I ’ ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow . Maybe this way I won ’ t be so tired every day , and Dan and I might even get to go
__label__joy	All you have to do is ask for help .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	What a thoughtful granddad ! Do you have her account details with you ?
__label__sadness	I'm afraid so . I don't remember you telling me about it .
__label__joy	Definitely . I really like Italian food .
__label__disgust	A well-learned person never does that .
__label__surprise	You did ? How ? Did you wear red underwear again this year ?
__label__joy	Thank you again .
__label__joy	Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station .
__label__joy	Ok , thank you .
__label__joy	Good night then !
__label__joy	Get in .
__label__joy	That sounds like a good idea .
__label__sadness	I am afraid I am not interested in fashion .
__label__joy	Yeah , it sure would .
__label__joy	Yes , certainly , madam .
__label__joy	Thanks , bye bye .
__label__joy	Yes . to our first anniversary and many more to come . Cheers !
__label__joy	Good morning , Jim !
__label__joy	Spacious , bright and clean.And the walls were newly painted .
__label__joy	No problem ! We have a broad selection of suits , all tailored made so that it will fit perfectly .
__label__joy	And good shot !
__label__anger	I can't bear you anymore . I am sick of your drinking . I am divorcing you .
__label__joy	Please do that . I can't wait to come back again . The performance must be really amazing .
__label__joy	Who wouldn't ? Wow , that's out of this world .
__label__joy	I appreciate it . It is related to company image .
__label__joy	Do you guys do anything special ?
__label__joy	Great . I would be happy to try it . I know my hair doesn't look good now . It's too weak .
__label__surprise	Are you serious ? You haven't even been anywhere on vacation ?
__label__joy	Let me have a look . Oh , no . They are Chinese poems which describe this happy scene .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__anger	What a bummer ! You set me up ?
__label__joy	Yeah , all right .
__label__anger	It is impossible . You cheated on me .
__label__joy	Yeah , most of the people are from our office .
__label__joy	What a pin-up she is !
__label__joy	Yes , it's to my liking , too .
__label__joy	it sounds really complicated . No wonder it tastes so great .
__label__anger	I don't know what a bench warrant is .
__label__joy	Yes , thank you . I've already been helping myself .
__label__joy	Hello , Kevin .
__label__sadness	I ’ m awfully sorry to hear that . I ’ ll turn to it right away .
__label__joy	I was happy to help .
__label__joy	Thanks !
__label__fear	But , dad , it's stormy outside .
__label__surprise	What ? You're kidding ! Let me see that ... There must be some mistakes .
__label__joy	I'm doing great , thank you .
__label__joy	Yeah , that ’ s perfect . What about the subjects for your minor ?
__label__joy	Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ?
__label__joy	How do I look ? I love these braids . They're fun !
__label__joy	Thank you . I think I'll take this one , and these pants as well . They're presents for a friend .
__label__joy	"Boris , look at this sentence . "" Healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love . "" It's interesting , isn't it ?"
__label__joy	Jennifer , would you like to have dinner with me ?
__label__joy	I appreciate what you have done for me.Everything I have seen here has left a deep impression on me . I really don't know how to express my thanks to you .
__label__joy	Oh , Penny , I'm Leonard , glad to meet you .
__label__joy	Another glass of beer , will you ?
__label__anger	We ’ re in the same boat ! I ’ Ve eaten fast food the whole week . I hate it now .
__label__disgust	Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it .
__label__joy	If that's okay with you .
__label__joy	Hello , Jane !
__label__sadness	I wouldn ’ t exactly characterize it in that way . I think something happened . Something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him to ... what if he showed up , took one look at me and left ?
__label__joy	I will bite many beautiful girls on the neck tonight . Maybe I will suck their blood .
__label__sadness	Oh , breaktime flies .
__label__joy	Great , take care .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__joy	I will do my best .
__label__joy	Of course not , we'd be happy if you could come.What time will you be able to come ?
__label__sadness	Yeah .
__label__joy	Thanks , Carla . That's quite a compliment coming from you . You always dress so tastefully .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Your birthday is coming , and I think this dress suits you . Why not try it now ?
__label__joy	I like it very much .
__label__joy	We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful .
__label__joy	Of course not.There are so many people here today .
__label__joy	I like it .
__label__joy	Hear me out . We can pool the money and give it to a family who could really use it !
__label__joy	You're really sporty !
__label__joy	Wow , what a lovely cake .
__label__joy	Kristy , that's wonderful ! Thanks so much for contacting me personally .
__label__joy	Absolutely . That's why I can always get a good price .
__label__joy	I appreciate all help of you during my stay here .
__label__joy	It fits me exactly . How does it look like ?
__label__joy	Would you be interested in joining me ?
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__sadness	Yes , I ache all over .
__label__disgust	Granted , it ’ s cheap , but the place is filthy , the beds are uncomfortable , there ’ s no A / C , the breakfast is pretty skimpy ... and the staff couldn ’ t care less about the guests .
__label__joy	Oh , great !
__label__joy	It's good to have you in the group . We can always use a good baritone !
__label__joy	All set . And we're having a red bean cake and dim sum for the Taiwanese guests , just like your mom wanted .
__label__sadness	I can ’ t believe it . I guess I ’ ll be here until 10 again tonight .
__label__joy	Yes , that's right . You have a good memory .
__label__surprise	Really ? How much does it cost to fly to Rome ?
__label__sadness	I just lost my job , and I am unsure about being able to find another one .
__label__sadness	I am awfully sorry . Please tell us about the stains before the dry-cleaning next time .
__label__joy	Alright . thanks .
__label__joy	I've never tasted anything better .
__label__surprise	What do you mean ?
__label__joy	Thank you for the invitation .
__label__anger	Oh , so it was my fault , was it ? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse .
__label__fear	I can ’ t go through with this ! I just can ’ t ! I ’ m not ready for marriage ! What was I thinking ? I ’ m only thirty five years old ! I ’ Ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! I can ’ t settle down yet !
__label__joy	We are ready to help you .
__label__surprise	I ’ Ve just found a mouse in the house !
__label__joy	Thank you . I know I've nothing to offer you , but I'll never give you reason to cry .
__label__joy	OK . We'll wait .
__label__joy	Of course ! Of course ! Here you are . Thank you so much .
__label__surprise	What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ’ m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ’ s absurd !
__label__joy	It's great . and I ' Ve heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent .
__label__joy	That's good to hear .
__label__joy	You know , Tom is my best friend and he asked me to be his best man .
__label__joy	I was happy to help .
__label__joy	She knows how to speak Spanish and Japanese .
__label__disgust	Well I don ’ t think so . I don ’ t like it at all !
__label__surprise	In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__surprise	Really ? You worked here for just half an hour . I consider the price very high .
__label__sadness	I'm very sorry to hear that .
__label__joy	Ok , thanks !
__label__joy	Wow ! Call him tonight ! You guys will really have an interesting love story to tell everyone !
__label__surprise	30,000 NT for ginseng ? ! Do I have to buy a whole jin ?
__label__joy	Look behind us at the mountains ! They're reflecting pink !
__label__fear	What a thrilling trip !
__label__joy	You are right . How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ?
__label__joy	Yeah . I hate all this traffic . It's really noisy .
__label__joy	You are such a good father . It's next Sunday .
__label__joy	The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car and the green flag drops ! Rikknen is still in the lead with only two laps to go !
__label__anger	Why are you trying to rush me off the phone ?
__label__joy	Oh , thank you very much .
__label__joy	Oh , that means I can do whatever I like without few interruptions .
__label__joy	You dance well . Do you breakdance ?
__label__joy	I've always liked green apples .
__label__sadness	So sorry , I must have confused the orders . I'll check it .
__label__joy	Sure , welcome anytime
__label__joy	It was fantastic , but I'm glad to be back ! Being a tourist is really tiring !
__label__surprise	Really ? Why ?
__label__joy	We'll contact you soon , Tom . Thanks for coming in .
__label__joy	No , thank you .
__label__joy	I actually like the food there .
__label__joy	My pleasure .

__label__joy	You're so lucky . I hope to get married to a guy like that .
__label__joy	It's no big deal . Thank you .
__label__joy	He's cute ! He looks like Tiger Woods ! But , I can't dance ...
__label__surprise	What park ? You found a doll in a park ? Gross !
__label__joy	Yes , they are shy and gentle but very powerful .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	They must be amazing animals .
__label__joy	Why not ?
__label__joy	I'm glad you enjoyed it .
__label__joy	Aren't they cool ? I like the settings .
__label__joy	He prefers suits to jackets .
__label__joy	I really need to learn this stuff .
__label__joy	Lorin Maazel . He did an amazing job . Moreover , he just celebrated his 75th birthday .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	It ’ s nice that she ’ s back for a while . Thinking of all these ailments , I got a splinter the other day . It took a long time for me to get it out of my skin . Look .
__label__surprise	A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me .
__label__sadness	It sure is.He has no one to turn to , very miserable indeed .
__label__joy	Well , thanks a lot for your help .
__label__joy	Yes , goodbye and keep in touch .
__label__joy	Okay , let me brush you off . Thank you very much for coming .
__label__joy	Well , I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her . Is there anything particular that you have in mind ?
__label__joy	Good . Where shall we meet ?
__label__joy	Wow ! A third more ? Very good .
__label__disgust	I'm tired of this job .
__label__joy	I guess I never thought of that before .
__label__joy	Fortunately , there is no person died .
__label__joy	That ’ d be fine .
__label__joy	Your daughter looks like her mother .
__label__joy	Bye !
__label__joy	Of course , I like flowers .
__label__joy	That's very good .
__label__joy	I love this wine ! It goes very well with the chicken .
__label__joy	The dinner is really rich .
__label__joy	That's why it's interesting .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	Hi , how are you doing ?
__label__joy	Nice to meet you , Mr . Wilson .
__label__joy	I am very satisfied with your answers .
__label__joy	OK , I'd love the company .
__label__joy	You have your ducks in a row .
__label__joy	It is our pleasure . It has been a great pleasure to work with you .
__label__joy	Thank you for all your help .
__label__anger	Why am I being charged $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered ?
__label__joy	Wonderful . Thank you very much . I have been dreaming to work with your company and I am finally granted the great opportunity . I won ’ t let you down and I hope you will contact me when you have any questions .
__label__surprise	Where ’ s my wallet ? Someone has stolen my wallet !
__label__joy	Very well , thank you .
__label__anger	Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !
__label__joy	You look great today . And so beautiful . I love your elegant haircut .
__label__joy	Tony looks very handsome in the suit .
__label__anger	That sucks . I'd be pissed if that happened to me .
__label__joy	You really can't live without candy .
__label__joy	Well , Jeff , that was a very productive meeting , I thought . You had some really great ideas in there !
__label__joy	I'm glad to help .
__label__anger	There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .
__label__joy	Thanks for helping out . Now that I ’ m ready , what are you doing tonight ?
__label__joy	Pleasure is mine.Here ' s my card .
__label__joy	Way to go ! It seems beautiful and very delicious .
__label__surprise	7 days ! What am I supposed to do for money until then ?
__label__joy	He loved his family and his countrymen and his freedom .
__label__surprise	I didn't do anything .
__label__surprise	That ’ s expensive .
__label__anger	Oh , shut up about ties ! Forget about ties , why not ?
__label__joy	What an interesting family !
__label__joy	That sounds perfect . Do you think I can get some highlights today , too ? I've always wanted red .
__label__surprise	Hi ! Fiona ? I almost didn't recognize you . You are much thinner since I last saw you .
__label__joy	I really appreciate your help .
__label__anger	Oh man ! I ’ Ve been starving myself for days now and I haven ’ t lost an ounce !
__label__joy	Have you ? That's splendid . Just let me get my things together . I won't keep you long .
__label__joy	thanks , I will . I'll see you tomorrow then !
__label__joy	That's all right.Show me the blue pen , please .
__label__joy	Oh , Thank you very much !
__label__sadness	I know that , mom . But sometimes I'm just sad .
__label__joy	The climate here is pleasant .
__label__anger	This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ’ ll give you your money back !
__label__joy	Okay . I'll see you then .
__label__joy	Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ?
__label__joy	You're welcome . Now smile ...
__label__joy	Ha ha , really ?
__label__surprise	Where ? my car ?
__label__joy	great , let's go !
__label__disgust	I can ’ t bear it . The driver is too bad .
__label__joy	Goodbye .
__label__surprise	Really ? Are you going to introduce us ?
__label__joy	Yes , it suits you very well . It certainly is unique . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve seen anything like it before .
__label__joy	So cool . I want to be a back-packer when I grow up .
__label__joy	It's marvelous ! The lawn looks like a green carpet , and the garden with so many lovely flowers .
__label__joy	I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
__label__joy	I promise .
__label__joy	Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive .
__label__joy	Not at all , but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly !
__label__anger	What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ...
__label__surprise	What happened to you ? You look like you got hit by a tornado !
__label__anger	I've been here for 3 years , and I haven't had a raise in all that time.If you like my work , it should be reflected in my pay , and I feel it isn't .
__label__joy	I ’ d be glad to .
__label__joy	She was patient , kind , fun , smart , caring , and yet strict , too . I really learned a lot from her .
__label__disgust	Me , too , I can ’ t stop scratching . They are everywhere ! Sneaky little jerks .
__label__joy	I like lotus .
__label__joy	Watch his bread , it seems to be delicious . He had a lot on the ball .
__label__joy	I've found a nice place in this district.Three bedrooms , a large kitchen , high ceilings , a tile bath and a big drawing room .
__label__joy	Thank you . Just a moment , please .
__label__joy	Yes , there must be about a hundred . Do you have a favorite ?
__label__sadness	Let me see , I am sorry . It's for table 11 .
__label__sadness	Again , I do apologize for the inconvenience .
__label__joy	That sounds great .
__label__joy	Thank you , Ma ’ am .
__label__joy	You're dancing so well .
__label__joy	That's good , I'm usually more comfortable in bigger families .
__label__surprise	Really ? Have you had an auto-reverse break before ?
__label__joy	That's a good choice . How do you want to pay for it ?
__label__joy	Very impressive . It's made of glass which makes it even brighter .
__label__joy	Well , my parents have rented a condominium in Florida . I'm going to take long walks along the beach every day and do lots of swimming .
__label__surprise	Cancelled ? That's just can't happen !
__label__joy	Maybe that's what I'll do . Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Ok , I'll meet you at the club at two thirty .
__label__joy	Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ?
__label__joy	Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station .
__label__joy	why not ? I love animals and I love nature .
__label__surprise	Really ? What can I do ?
__label__anger	Don ’ t ever mention him . I ’ m getting over it .
__label__joy	Thanks for reminding me . I ’ Ve prepared some party games for the children too .
__label__fear	I know for sure that something is wrong !
__label__joy	Let me see . Yes , Mary . Let ’ s make it next Wednesday .
__label__surprise	Small ? But it should be enough for our needs , I think .
__label__joy	Thank you for your interview with me .
__label__joy	OK , thanks for the order .
__label__joy	That's good enough , I think . What colors does the new Accord come in ?
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__surprise	Really ? Are you sure ?
__label__joy	Gorgeous ! What should I bring on that day ?
__label__joy	Did you go to the Summer Mountain Resort ?
__label__surprise	I can ’ t believe Obama is our President .
__label__joy	OK , thank you .
__label__joy	Anyway , we are arriving at Danshui soon . I can't wait to watch the beautiful sunset .
__label__sadness	I'm leaving now , mum .
__label__joy	UCLA was my second choice , but I ’ m happy knowing I ’ Ve been accepted .
__label__joy	that's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ?
__label__joy	Fine today , though a bit under the weather last week .
__label__joy	Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ?
__label__joy	OK . No problem .
__label__joy	That sounds like a good idea .
__label__surprise	Yes , it is . Hi , Tom ! It's a real surprise to see you here .
__label__joy	Do you want to go to the beach there ?
__label__joy	Really ? Oh , this one . I like the cloisonn vase .
__label__joy	Sure . Which button do I press to shoot ?
__label__joy	Wonderful .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , I'm having a little trouble understanding your accent .
__label__joy	My pleasure .
__label__joy	That would be fun .
__label__joy	Ma , I really don't know how to thank you .
__label__joy	We can play together if you are free .
__label__joy	No thanks .
__label__surprise	You can ’ t be serious .
__label__joy	OK , thanks .
__label__joy	It ’ s my pleasure .
__label__sadness	My condolences .
__label__surprise	You can ’ t be serious !
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome .
__label__sadness	My girlfriend just broke up with me .
__label__joy	Yeah , you ’ re a pretty big guy . I play goalie , myself .
__label__sadness	I don't know , I can't stand my job these days .
__label__joy	Pleased to see you . Welcome to our company . I hope you have a good day .
__label__joy	I want to show my gratitude for your hospitality . And I believe me trip here will be meaningful and our cooperation will go deeper and stabler in near future . Through the communication , we can know more about each other . Thank you so much for your consideration .
__label__joy	Who is afraid ? I am not afraid .
__label__joy	Your ring is very beautiful .
__label__joy	I'm just in the mood to act goofy .
__label__joy	Thanks !
__label__joy	I hope you enjoy it here .
__label__surprise	Are you kidding ? The meter says 15 dollars , doesn't it ?
__label__joy	Have you met my wife , Mary ?
__label__joy	Look ! That man who is baking bread is so handsome .
__label__joy	These are my roses . The roses have been in flower for a week .
__label__anger	You wouldn ’ t dare do that !
__label__joy	They look great ! Hey , are you hungry ? I know a good Ethiopian restaurant-Meskerem .
__label__joy	Fine ! Well , I'll get right on it now !
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Thanks for helping out.Now Im ready , what are you doing tonight ?
__label__joy	Sure . I'll try my best to find a satisfying one for you .
__label__joy	Well , for one thing , she's gorgeous . She's so upbeat and sweet . Who doesn't like her ? Oh , I don't know . All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together . But , what if I'm wrong . Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way . Oh ... forget it . This was a bad idea .
__label__sadness	No . I couldn ’ t find a policeman .
__label__anger	That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying !
__label__joy	When are you returning home ?
__label__anger	What did you think you were doing ?
__label__surprise	What ? Are you kidding ?
__label__joy	That sounds great . More dividends if I want to purchase them !
__label__sadness	I ’ m sorry , Jim .
__label__joy	Guess what !
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__anger	Oh , damn . There ’ s another traffic jam on the highway .
__label__joy	I honestly love it .
__label__joy	Nothing else , thank you .
__label__joy	Yes . It's a birthday present from my husband !
__label__joy	Travelling , swimming , going to the cinema . And you ?
__label__sadness	What are we going to do now ?
__label__joy	Yes , I like collecting things .
__label__joy	Ok , thank you .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .. Bye .
__label__joy	I know it's so exciting ! A new year is always like a clean slate . Fresh start to accomplish any dreams , objectives and goals .
__label__surprise	Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything .
__label__joy	That sounds good ! Please bring me one of those .
__label__anger	Yes , and hurry up !
__label__joy	Thank you . I never can find my way around this store .
__label__anger	Yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable . Sometimes he ’ s really productive , but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance , he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting !
__label__joy	A match made in heaven .
__label__joy	Sure . I love going to the mall .
__label__joy	What a good idea !
__label__joy	That's great . Congratulations .
__label__joy	You needn ’ t buy one . You can have mine .
__label__disgust	I ’ m not interested in it . Are you keen on it ?
__label__joy	When's the wedding going to be ?
__label__joy	Sure . I'll get right on it .
__label__joy	That sounds good . Last year I paid $ 30 .
__label__joy	Here is a good place . Let's get out .
__label__joy	So he will make a perfect husband . Make sure you will be here next Monday .
__label__fear	I'm scared that she might not come back .
__label__joy	Yes , I know . I appreciate your invitation .
__label__joy	Well , thank you for coming .
__label__joy	You are a smart girl !
__label__joy	Don't mention it .
__label__joy	Sounds interesting . Who are the other people ?
__label__anger	I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It ' s unbelievable !
__label__joy	Have a nice day and thanks you for calling Dutton Hotels .
__label__joy	Thank you for your help .
__label__joy	I ’ m so proud of you .
__label__surprise	Are you serious ? Why would they have to go to such extreme measures like a strike ? Doesn't your company have a pretty good corporate image ? I'll bet the folks at headquarters are going nuts over something as serious as a strike ...
__label__joy	Thanks a billion .
__label__joy	Do we need to book a table in advance ?
__label__anger	Even if I was seriously ill you couldn't spare a moment .
__label__joy	"You might think this strange , but I like the category for “ best foreign language film "" ."
__label__joy	Oh , you dance it so well .
__label__joy	I'll be at your house at about 5:30 . Happy birthday .
__label__sadness	He took all my things , but he didn't hurt me .
__label__joy	That dog has white long hair . It ’ s lovely .
__label__joy	Terrific ! When are you moving in ?
__label__joy	The lyrics of the new song are beautiful , too . Can you sing ?
__label__joy	Yes , that looks great ! Is it on our Open House list ?
__label__joy	Wow , it all looks so good . I ’ m not sure what to choose .
__label__joy	I appreciate you bringing the wine . It goes well with the chicken .
__label__joy	Well , I think I like it . I appreciate the snow very much .
__label__joy	Yes , of course . Step in , please !
__label__joy	What about tomorrow ? Are you doing anything tomorrow ?
__label__joy	perfect !
__label__joy	If you are staying here for a few days , we ’ d be delighted to see you at our factory .
__label__joy	It's just what I want .
__label__joy	The brown leather shoes go well with your trousers .
__label__joy	that would be great . I really only want to taste real Chinese food , not just the food that foreigners like to eat !
__label__fear	Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ?
__label__joy	Yes , let's do it now .
__label__joy	Remember that writing contest I entered ? Well , I won first prize .
__label__surprise	Really ? Are you going to introduce us ?
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , sir , but I'll have to give you a ticket .
__label__surprise	Forgotten about it ? How could you ?
__label__surprise	Oh . My God ! Are you serious ?
__label__joy	I think so . I ’ Ve got the shopping list , so let ’ s go .
__label__joy	Hey , Mark , long time no see .
__label__sadness	I often feel so tired .
__label__disgust	You can yell at them .
__label__joy	No , I don't often dance . Isn't this a wonderful party ?
__label__sadness	I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ?
__label__joy	Linda , that would be a perfect addition .
__label__sadness	I failed my oral test .
__label__joy	Right , see you then !
__label__joy	( At the Party ) It's Christmas Eve ! Time to open presents !
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Hello Bill , what's new ?
__label__joy	You're welcome . Good luck , bye !
__label__joy	Thank you very much . I ’ ll be there on time .
__label__joy	that's cool . I can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products .
__label__joy	Absolutely right.He gave a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto.That caused a sensation.The audience were stunned by his pure tone .
__label__joy	It sure is . The Grand Canyon is truly a masterpiece . No man could ever make anything like this .
__label__anger	Look at what you have done . All thumbs .
__label__joy	That's fine . Thank you again .
__label__joy	Yes .
__label__joy	Is it very interesting ?
__label__joy	Thanks for inviting me to work out with you , Joan .
__label__joy	Have a nice Thanksgiving !
__label__joy	And he can move , too ! He dances like Ricky Martin !
__label__joy	That's a dandy idea . Thank you for reminding me .
__label__joy	That's wonderful .
__label__joy	We could have another on the successes of graduates from here .
__label__sadness	We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet .
__label__joy	Have a nice day , bye !
__label__joy	Come on ! It ’ ll be fun . We play every other Saturday afternoon from May until August .
__label__surprise	Are you kidding ? $ 100 for this big leather sofa ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	You ’ Ve been working there for so long with so much sacrifice . You definitely deserve it .
__label__anger	You're just jealous because you didn't do as well as you thought you did . Admit it .
__label__sadness	I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down .
__label__anger	They were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and I ’ m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ’ Ve had all day .
__label__joy	Fred and David , my college class mates and Rachel .
__label__anger	I've been standing here since half past seven . Where on earth have you been ?
__label__joy	That sounds kind of fun , maybe I can get tighter with my friends that night .
__label__joy	That's excellent ! Have you received your conditional offers yet ?
__label__anger	Haven't I asked you to call if you're going to be home late ?
__label__joy	What a cool see-through blue ! How do you wear this thing ?
__label__joy	It suits my taste . You are really a good cook .
__label__joy	Thanks . Would you like to have one more slice ?
__label__joy	Sure , my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way . They ’ re pretty satisfied with it .
__label__joy	We have developed new technology about it . And the new product will be a pleasure to be hold .
__label__joy	You made a good choice , then ?
__label__joy	All right . What should I take ?
__label__anger	Why are you being so nice to me ? Don't think for a second that I trust you .
__label__joy	Well , Thanksgiving is family event.So on Thanksgiving , family members will get together and enjoy a big Thanksgiving dinner . Kids will have lot of fun .
__label__disgust	Yeah . I get sick of her . She always bends my ear about what she thinks .
__label__joy	Yes , a legend , also . I still remember , his movies , Jurassic Park and Schindler's List got him nine Oscar awards in 1994 .
__label__joy	Yeah ? I guess so . I spent the weekend at beach .
__label__joy	That's great ! I think they do you a lot of good . Where do you swim ?
__label__joy	Good idea , let's shop to we drop !
__label__joy	I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby !
__label__joy	I think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you .
__label__anger	I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that the night , but she didn't answer the phone .
__label__joy	Really ? OK !
__label__joy	I admit that she is much prettier than Kate .
__label__joy	Fantastic ! I didn't want to come back .
__label__joy	Tom , this deal promises big returns for both sides . Let's hope it's the beginning of a long and prosperous relationship .
__label__surprise	How can you stay so calm ? Aren't you going to take a look to see if there is anything for you ?
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , but I'm afraid you've dialed the wrong number.There is no Stefan here .
__label__joy	That ’ s a good point . Car owners will probably be against it , but people who use public transport will be in favor of it .
__label__joy	Pick up a wood and hold it like this , interlocking your fingers .
__label__sadness	I am sorry . It's a one-price shop .
__label__joy	Yes , I agree with you . I am going to find a good company and invest in it soon .
__label__joy	What time shall I pick you up ?
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? That is great news . What does he look like ?
__label__joy	Great . What do you think of it ?
__label__surprise	Really ? Well , what time does it start ?
__label__surprise	You've got to be joking ! It's the teacher's right to say anything wants , and if she saw Myra cheating , she certainly had the right to say so .
__label__joy	That's a good idea !
__label__joy	And I also admire him for his courage in fighting for equal rights .
__label__joy	All right .
__label__joy	How nice it is here
__label__joy	Ok , for starters we have Tom Yam soup . It's a bit spicy , but really good !
__label__joy	After all that violence , people needed to laugh , so from the mid-to-late l940 ' s , many detective movies about policemen who solved crimes were made . Then came musicals .
__label__joy	That's all right .
__label__anger	That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself !
__label__joy	Oh , that's exciting . What's this guy like ? Is he hot ?
__label__joy	it looks great , but you need something to go with it . It's too plain on its own .
__label__joy	That's all right .
__label__sadness	Really , because spicy food is my favorite .
__label__joy	I'll miss you too , my friends .
__label__anger	Oh John , I thought we said we would start eating right ! Remember ? Our new healthy lifestyle ? That ’ s all junk food !
__label__anger	How come it is slow as a snail today ?
__label__joy	It must be a unique experience . I ’ m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
__label__joy	And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
__label__joy	Sure . There is a changing room behind you .
__label__joy	It's no trouble at all .
__label__joy	Woo , your home will beautiful on Christmas .
__label__joy	This all looks good ! I think we know what we want .
__label__surprise	Really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime .
__label__joy	My pleasure . Have you seen the movie yet ?
__label__joy	Let's hope for good cooperation between us .
__label__joy	But I also heard some people didn't like her music . I don't understand why . She is so amazing !
__label__surprise	Impossible !
__label__joy	That's terrific . Thank you .
__label__joy	That's a great idea . Show me the Barbie dolls .
__label__joy	Yeah , why not ? We haven't been out for dinner for quite a long time . A new French restaurant has just opened in our neighborhood . We can go there .
__label__joy	That ’ s great . Can you do it anywhere ?
__label__joy	You said it.Let ' s ask him to work in our bank .
__label__surprise	Really ? I ’ m not sure that I would like all the attention . There have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star ’ s private live in recent years .
__label__joy	Sure . What's playing ?
__label__sadness	I know , I am sorry I ever bought it .
__label__surprise	No , really ?
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , but this was on sale , so I can only give you store credit .
__label__joy	Let's string the lights first.Then we won't have to mess up the decorations .
__label__joy	Thanks . I am feeling pretty good about myself too . You know , bigger office , a raise and even an assistant .
__label__joy	Thanks very much for your help , Li Lan . See you tomorrow .
__label__joy	It ’ s a very cool job .
__label__surprise	Oh yeah ? What do you need to go shopping for ?
__label__joy	Thank you . Oh , it tastes nice .
__label__joy	Really ? That's great . You really did a good job . Anything else to tell me ?
__label__joy	Yes , its design is very elaborate and the designer took many weeks to make it .
__label__joy	Of course . I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too.Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment .
__label__joy	Yes , it is lovely . I have been expecting something like this for a long time . Thanks ever so much .
__label__joy	I would love to .
__label__joy	How sweet ! Maybe he was just a shy guy who had a crush on you !
__label__joy	Thank you for your kindness , ma'am . See you next Monday .
__label__surprise	Really ! What's the matter with him ?
__label__joy	Sure .
__label__joy	Well , it was nice meeting you .
__label__joy	You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous .
__label__joy	Thank you . See you .
__label__joy	Yes , I can see . The summer heat is over , and the winter cold is still far away .
__label__joy	OK . where and when ?
__label__sadness	This has been the worst and best day of my life , Taylor . They kept you in the hospital , and ...
__label__joy	I am sure they will be pleased .
__label__joy	OK , I will .
__label__joy	She is the mature , stable , feminine type . I hope one day I can marry her .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Congratulations to you .
__label__sadness	I feel kind of stupid .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot . We arrived at Kaohsiung International Airport .
__label__surprise	Really ? It took me really a while to find the color . I am happy you like it .
__label__surprise	No , I shall faint .
__label__joy	I enjoyed myself , too .
__label__joy	Oh , they're both so beautiful . Let me have this one , I think .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Jane ! What an enchanting skirt you have on !
__label__fear	Well in the meantime you are a biohazard ! I didn ’ t get it when I was a kid and I ’ Ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult !
__label__joy	Thank you for the invitation .
__label__joy	Yes , if it's not too much of a trouble .
__label__disgust	Hell with it ! Nobody will give it an Academy award !
__label__anger	But what ? You always act like this , when you face difficulties .
__label__joy	Would you care for something to drink , Mr . Stone ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Perfect . See you later .
__label__joy	Well , I don't know .
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome .
__label__joy	Would you like to go to the concert with me ?
__label__surprise	Really ? How did you get the chance ?
__label__surprise	I ’ m still shocked that Obama was elected .
__label__joy	Certainly . Go along Queen's Road ...
__label__joy	Great ! Let ’ s do it !
__label__joy	It was my pleasure .
__label__joy	Hello , Alice . Would you like to go to the temple fair with me ?
__label__joy	Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot .
__label__joy	Good luck .
__label__anger	Because I'm the wrong sex , of course !
__label__anger	Good heavens ! Don't bring that frog in the house .
__label__joy	Yes , both . Last trip I fished a little and hiked five miles .
__label__joy	Thank you ! We have really enjoyed our meal here .
__label__joy	See you soon ! Bye ! Egg ... I can ’ t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter .
__label__joy	Haha ! I actually think that many locals would disagree with you ; they are all dying to be paid in US dollars .
__label__joy	April might be nice . It is far enough away to make the necessary arrangements .
__label__joy	I want to try something exciting .
__label__joy	Oh , sorry again , thank you mom .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	That's very kind of you .
__label__joy	( Laugh ) All right . You caught me in the act . I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out . I was just writing a note to put on her desk .
__label__joy	Bill , I have received the admission letter from Cambridge University !
__label__sadness	I'm afraid this course is for four persons .
__label__joy	"Oh , I see . But a proverb says "" Money makes the mare go . "" I think it will be better if you have more money ."
__label__joy	Thank you for choosing Bruno's . We look forward to seeing you on the 2nd .
__label__joy	You mean with my performance ?
__label__joy	That's funny , I didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
__label__sadness	Some guy on the street just mugged me .
__label__fear	I can smell smoke !
__label__joy	Yeah . We are lucky . Let's go buy the tickets first . We can have breakfast later . I am so hungry .
__label__joy	Well , that's for all . Excellent !
__label__joy	I'm very glad to hear that .
__label__sadness	I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime .
__label__joy	Oh okay , thank you .
__label__anger	But why were you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn't it ?
__label__sadness	Sorry , I'm very near sighted .
__label__joy	Very well , thank you , Mr . Parker .
__label__joy	Bye .
__label__surprise	No , I haven't . I'm so surprised at the news .
__label__joy	Nice to meet you , John .
__label__joy	Okay then . I think we will all meet outside ?
__label__joy	That's fine .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Are you even glad that we get to buy new clothes too ?
__label__joy	We get alone very well .
__label__fear	I'm bleeding too much .
__label__joy	Thank you for your compliments . It's just that you are a good leader . Do you like the samba and waltz ?
__label__anger	There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired for me for sure .
__label__joy	But that doesn't stop me from drinking . Ahahah .
__label__joy	Wow ! What else does it do ?
__label__joy	Haven't seen you for a long time
__label__joy	I'll talk to my husband about it ; I'm sure he'll say yes ! He loves Switzerland !
__label__joy	Thanks again . You look nice today , too .
__label__joy	That's true . Four years ' trails and hardships , joys and sorrows of life are gushing out to my mind all together . I can hardly tell whether I am joyful or gloomy at the moment when I am about to leave the campus and to start a new stage of my life .
__label__joy	how about I come and see you off ?
__label__joy	Very good .
__label__joy	I appreciate your help . Maybe I'll be back for more computer stuff .
__label__joy	That sounds like a great idea !
__label__anger	I am not convinced by your explanation .
__label__joy	Thank you very much . I had a really good time .
__label__joy	Merry Christmas , Lily .
__label__joy	That's very generous of you . Thanks for the offer .
__label__joy	And don't forget your fishing tackle .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry . I've been having some problems .
__label__joy	Don ’ t be mean . Look here come the bridesmaids ! Their dresses look beautiful !
__label__joy	The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ?
__label__anger	They ’ re really running you into the ground . Why don ’ t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere .
__label__joy	We waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa .
__label__joy	I have trouble understanding all these forms ... but I'm sure I'll get it .
__label__joy	I've never seen a movie I don't like that had Harrison Ford in it .
__label__fear	I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .
__label__joy	I like it a lot but I need to talk with my wife . Can you hold it for me for two days ?
__label__anger	I'm about to explode ! You ’ Ve made a mess of this matter .
__label__joy	That's a good idea , I think I will try that at the next meeting .
__label__joy	Oh , everything comes back to life in spring and the weather gets warmer .
__label__anger	He's a sad dog . He came to the wedding in jeans !
__label__joy	Thank you . I will if I have chance.Goodbye and happy landing !
__label__joy	Come on , don ’ t flatter me anymore . I took the job because I love being challenged . But I can ’ t get this turned around without the support from you people .
__label__sadness	I don't understand of myself . It seems they have to save money .
__label__joy	Ugh !
__label__joy	Yeah , that ’ s a good idea , and you like to cook . What about the books ?
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__surprise	look ! they've taken your fur coat too .
__label__surprise	Really ? You are a lucky dog . You know , many girls dream of dating him .
__label__joy	I know . It's going to be so much fun .
__label__joy	Hi , Kathy ! I'm just doing my morning yoga ! You're up awfully early today .
__label__surprise	Cute ? Hope so .
__label__anger	Why should I wear a skirt ? Or a dress ?
__label__joy	I think it ’ s great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I ’ Ve actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine ’ s for a while now , but I wasn ’ t sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment .
__label__joy	Well , that sounds like it would be OK . Just be careful .
__label__joy	I'm doing really well . I got married about three years ago . I have two kids now .
__label__joy	Thank you . I can't imagine getting much done today . I'm just too exhausted !
__label__joy	Thank you so much for your help .
__label__joy	Oh , that's only a few days from now ! How many weeks are you going to be taking ?
__label__joy	Yes . I bought two boxed of chocolate ? one for me and one for you !
__label__joy	Sure .
__label__joy	I'm glad you liked it . Are you ready for dessert ?
__label__joy	This is the first time for me to have a Chinese guest . I hope you like western cooking .
__label__joy	You're right . Thank you for the advice .
__label__joy	In the evening , we just sit and talk over dinner . But on the weekend , we try to go out to the beach or hit a nice restaurant , or go to a nice cafe .
__label__joy	You are welcome . Good luck .
__label__surprise	Wait , what are you doing ! You can ’ t just kiss me then go for second base !
__label__joy	Yes , I remember last year this time , the weather is so hot .
__label__anger	I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me .
__label__surprise	Really ? Their songs are very popular all round Asia now . I am also a big fan of theirs .
__label__joy	Merry Christmas , Lee !
__label__sadness	Gee . I must have left it in my hotel room .
__label__joy	Ok , thanks . I'll let you know what I find .
__label__anger	I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots .
__label__joy	Great . That ' s just the sort of thing I'm looking for . Thanks .
__label__joy	Okay , but you are going to be my masterpiece !
__label__joy	Yes , I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist .
__label__sadness	I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday .
__label__joy	I'm looking forward to it .
__label__joy	I ’ m very proud to be employed by your firm .
__label__joy	I'll do everything for you , love . You know that , maybe you didn't realize , but you made everyday a enjoys moment and happy occasion .
__label__anger	No wonder he asked for my address first-he just wants to harass me !
__label__joy	That must be very beautiful .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot.here .
__label__joy	See you then .
__label__joy	Sure . I ’ ll also take some silver cuff link and a pair of silk ties .
__label__fear	I'm so nervous about this oral test .
__label__surprise	Oh no ! Mike ’ s birthday is a drinkfest for sure !
__label__joy	Oh , yes . I had a look yesterday . I found some of the exhibits to be fine in quality and beautiful in design . The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . I ’ Ve gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . I ’ Ve got some idea of your exports . I ’ m interested in your silk blouses .
__label__joy	That will be all . You've been very helpful , thanks .
__label__disgust	I don't like anything about it .
__label__sadness	Yes , I am sorry . I missed the bus .
__label__joy	Hi . are you new here ?
__label__joy	I got two . We can go there together .
__label__joy	OK .
__label__joy	It is a great place for a relaxing vacation .
__label__joy	So see you .
__label__joy	It's my dream .
__label__joy	Well , we have some special projects coming up . Would you be interested in working on any of those ?
__label__joy	Exactly . Instead , we should have some drinks tonight .
__label__joy	That ’ s a good idea ! The kitchen will look amazing !
__label__surprise	Morning , Jenny . Haven't seen you for ages !
__label__joy	I'll always remember my college days .
__label__joy	Yes , it is better than last year . They have done a very good job this time .
__label__joy	Hello , I'm Lance .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Yes . And we're proud of you , Loans .
__label__joy	Oh , well thank you very much .
__label__joy	Pretty well . I think the boss liked my ideas .
__label__joy	OK . Good-bye .
__label__surprise	You ’ re kidding . It can ’ t be true .
__label__surprise	Really ? But I can smell alcohol on your breath . Blow to the breathalyzer , please .
__label__surprise	Look ! The iron is still on .
__label__surprise	Nine thirty ? That ’ s no good . Couldn ’ t I have it a bit longer ? Even if I fill up the tank ?
__label__anger	See you .
__label__joy	OK . I'll take it .
__label__joy	Um ... It's wonderful to be here . Uh ... this place looks really cozy .
__label__surprise	Honey , don't tell me that you forgot our anniversary , did you ?
__label__anger	In a word , cockroaches !
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
__label__joy	I am so impressed with the candidate I ’ m going to vote for .
__label__joy	No , the one on the left . Yes , that ′ s the one . ... Thank you .
__label__joy	How beautiful ! I love it at all .
__label__joy	So find a guy to marry and you can get one !
__label__sadness	It's the end of the world for me .
__label__joy	What a nice theatre ! I guess it can seat hundreds of people .
__label__anger	How could I help but follow it ? The fluctuation of dollar is killing my company ! The exchange rates are eating into our profits , and we can't do anything about it .
__label__joy	That ’ s great . Those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition . They must be terribly disappointed if they don ’ t win .
__label__joy	Don't mention it .
__label__joy	We haven't played chess for a long time . How about playing chess ?
__label__joy	Oh , then it's my honor to be here with you . I can see now why you've been so curious about the bar . You like this place ?
__label__joy	I am sure it will . It'll be of great help in carrying on the work I have done so far .
__label__surprise	That's it ! That's the one I was thinking of ! I told you I'd remember it !
__label__joy	I ’ m glad . We have only about twenty things here , and I ’ m in a hurry to get home .
__label__joy	Yes . I can feel the difference in material . There ’ s not much difference in price . Ok , I ’ ll take the more expensive one .
__label__joy	Have a wallet size print made for me , too .
__label__joy	Thanks a million , you are a lifesaver .
__label__fear	He is not answering . You'd better check his pulse and breathing .
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome . The rain is quite heavy , isn ’ t it ?
__label__joy	See you .
__label__joy	Sure , that would be great ! Thank you !
__label__sadness	All right . Just give me the ticket .
__label__joy	That's cool .
__label__joy	Why don't you have dinner with me tonight ?
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	I'm glad to hear that . In case he's not insured , the hospital will never accepts any patient .
__label__joy	What a good idea . I'm quite hungry .
__label__joy	It's very helpful . The course has let me into a new world of literature . I read so many great literatures .
__label__sadness	That's the last time I'm trusting you with the transportation .
__label__surprise	Are you kidding ? When I get on stage , my palms start to sweat , I get really nervous and I can hardly speak .
__label__joy	But I'm not sure you're strong enough yet . Here's some seafood rice soup I made . It's delicious .
__label__joy	Jack , I hear you got promoted.Is that true ?
__label__joy	That ’ s a great idea . I ’ ll search for some information on the internet . If it ’ s possible to do , the internet will have some information about it .
__label__joy	What a good idea !
__label__surprise	Really ? oh ! I'm glad you let me know .
__label__sadness	Excuse me sir . May I come in ?
__label__joy	Ron , have a seat and I'll get us something to drink .
__label__joy	OK , great Daddy , after supper , I'll embark on it .
__label__joy	Sure . As many as you want .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	That ’ s all the time we have for today , but join us next time where we ’ ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna ! Till next time !
__label__anger	We have been together for a year and usually , people who've been together a year , take their vacation together .
__label__joy	Sounds perfect . I'll take the pink one . Can you pack it for me ?
__label__joy	All right . It's just four o'clock .
__label__joy	That ’ s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number .
__label__sadness	It's just too bad . I have to leave it as it is , and thank you just the same .
__label__joy	How does 7:30 sound ?
__label__surprise	My Willie ? Why has he suddenly become my Willie ?
__label__joy	All right .
__label__joy	Certainly .
__label__joy	My warmest congratulations on your entering the Oxford University .
__label__joy	Oh , it's nothing to speak of .
__label__surprise	What ? Are you serious ?
__label__sadness	I ’ m sorry , Ms . Fairbanks . I won ’ t let it happen again .
__label__joy	That's great .
__label__surprise	Look how fast that car can accelerate !
__label__joy	Yes . He carries a lot of weight . Everyone here is willing to follow his orders .
__label__joy	How about Sunday , then ? We could start in the morning .
__label__surprise	What ’ s wrong with you ?
__label__joy	Thanks for helping me .
__label__joy	This is worth trying .
__label__joy	You're quite slim . In fact , if you were one of those starlets , the movie company would say you have a fabulous figure .
__label__joy	He always wears an extremely becoming suit with tie .
__label__surprise	Wait , what are you doing ? I ’ m a married woman ! You can ’ t just try to kiss me like this !
__label__joy	Gosh sir , thank you , sir ! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department .
__label__surprise	You seem to have bought the whole market !
__label__joy	Good luck . I hope you each some fish .
__label__joy	It's our pleasure .
__label__joy	Sure , no problem , sir .
__label__joy	I think that we have a pretty good idea of what we would like to order .
__label__joy	"Now let me sing "" Happy birthday "" for you ."
__label__joy	I would be happy to look at apartments with you .
__label__joy	I like this style . But do you have any other colors ? I feel that this color doesn't suit his complexion .
__label__joy	Really ? That's very good of you , Helen . But I must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing .
__label__surprise	I can't believe the way our landlord cheated us .
__label__joy	I'm glad to hear that . Congratulations !
__label__joy	Hi Mary . We are really looking forward to a great meal here .
__label__joy	I'd love to ! But I have never learned martial arts , and there is only a month left before the New Year .
__label__joy	Wow , that's great !
__label__surprise	What ? Man , you don't know how to write a project report ? That's sounds a little bit ridiculous .
__label__joy	Good luck to you .
__label__joy	Dress casually and bring your bathing suit !
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__anger	Are you kidding me ?
__label__joy	Well , don ’ t be late . I ’ ll see you on Friday at helen ’ s .
__label__joy	I especially like the wonderful chicken dish .
__label__surprise	What is it ? Why are all these clothes on the bed ?
__label__joy	I see . And I'll always be devoted to you .
__label__joy	That new Sony camcorder you've got is just beautiful .
__label__joy	Of course you can . ( Lead Carl to his garage . )
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , but we don't allow returns on sale items .
__label__joy	Yes , I will . Have a nice flight back .
__label__joy	that would be great . thanks .
__label__joy	I will , thank you .
__label__joy	Sure . I like the writer's language , too .
__label__surprise	It ’ s the police ! Pull over !
__label__joy	Happy birthday to you ! I'd really love to come , but I'm not sure right now . I'll try to make it.Thank you for your invitation .
__label__joy	I think you can go to visit the museum . It's worth seeing . You can go to the square some other time .
__label__joy	You look prettier than before .
__label__joy	Of course , no list of film would be complete without animated movies . These are especially popular among children .
__label__joy	That ’ s all right .
__label__fear	What ? A fire ? Oh , my God ! What shall I do ? Please get me out of here !
__label__joy	It was really nice talking to you too .
__label__joy	Thank you . But there's still a lot for me to learn .
__label__joy	You're kidding !
__label__surprise	Are you serious ?
__label__sadness	No so good . I broke traffic regulations yesterday and I got a ticket .
__label__joy	Thank you . I appreciate the compliment .
__label__joy	I ’ m so happy to hear that ! I knew we belong together . I love you so much .
__label__joy	Certainly ! I suppose you dance often .
__label__sadness	Well , I'm leaving Japan and I'm going back to London , tomorrow .
__label__sadness	Too bad . But , is there any other leather store nearby ?
__label__joy	I'm really pleased with it.Thanks .
__label__joy	Thank you , I will be doing my best .
__label__anger	What ’ s your problem ! Geez . Having a fit is not going to help !
__label__joy	Bye .
__label__joy	even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun .
__label__surprise	Come on ! You're pulling my leg .
__label__joy	I bought you some books on literature , I don't know if you would like them .
__label__joy	I'll ask Mrs . Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ?
__label__joy	Yes , I would . Thanks for being in my life .
__label__joy	Yes ! Isn't that exciting ?
__label__joy	When will you be convenient ?
__label__joy	Well , we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia .
__label__fear	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Yeah , I'm going to the Temple Fair with my family .
__label__joy	Well , it's a special day . They say if you survive the first year , the rest is smooth sailing .
__label__joy	No , I'm full . My stomach isn't growling at me any more .
__label__joy	Mmm ... Well we could go to that new art gallery instead .
__label__fear	Not a problem , sir . Please remember us in the future .
__label__joy	Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house .
__label__joy	Ok . See you there in about 30 minutes .
__label__joy	Too easy questions . Listen carefully . Hollywood is the movie capital of the world.It is located in southern California . Many films have been made there , and the kinds have changed often .
__label__joy	why not ? it's so cool .
__label__joy	Congratulations ! How can you get such a good opportunity to be trained overseas ?
__label__sadness	No , I don ’ t want to eat anything .
__label__joy	it's made from naturally frozen grapes .
__label__joy	So , is that a yes ?
__label__joy	It ’ s great .
__label__sadness	How horrible !
__label__sadness	I really don't want to know about this . Physics gives me a headache .
__label__joy	Wow , this car can really burn rubber .
__label__surprise	Hackneyed theme !
__label__joy	Fantastic ! I got an overall score of eight .
__label__joy	I'll give it a try . Give me a call and let's go down together .
__label__joy	I am so glad I caught you at home . I need your help !
__label__joy	Yes , thanks .
__label__joy	It ’ s just the cows that are grazing over there . We can milk them later .
__label__joy	thanks , but I'll stick with some jasmine tea . I'm trying to watch my diet .
__label__joy	Great ! I'll look forward to it . We'll make sure and check the mail for our invitation .
__label__sadness	I will , sir . I'm really very sorry .
__label__joy	He ’ s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ?
__label__joy	You see that chick over there ?
__label__joy	My pleasure .
__label__joy	Neither do I . Let's stay in a cabin.It ' ll be much nicer right beside the ocean .
__label__joy	You're welcome . I hope all of you will have a good time here .
__label__joy	Of course . You have to fill out the form first .
__label__joy	That sounds pretty good . Let's watch that .
__label__sadness	Oh , I'm terribly sorry . but I couldn't find the yoghurt I saw here last time .
__label__joy	What a good idea !
__label__joy	Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A .
__label__surprise	Dad ! Are you serious ? What ’ s the point of having central heating if we can ’ t use it ! Look , I can see my breath !
__label__surprise	Really ? There aren't many left now .
__label__joy	don ’ t worry . I ’ Ve decided that for your birthday I ’ m going to take you shopping for a new dress .
__label__anger	It really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens . I even want to wring his neck .
__label__sadness	You are really tough . You got a deal .
__label__anger	I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her .
__label__sadness	Sorry , you have the wrong number . There's no Brian here .
__label__joy	Pretty good . Say , you've really changed !
__label__joy	Sure , we call it doubt .
__label__surprise	I don't know what happened !
__label__joy	I've really enjoyed your party , Lisa .
__label__surprise	Twenty years ! That's a long time .
__label__joy	I ’ m glad to have had the opportunity to meet you here .
__label__joy	Congratulations , Francis . Your hard working finally pays off . I am so happy for your promotion .
__label__anger	Stop talking like my mother . That's what she keeps saying .
__label__sadness	I'm fine . I'm just so touched by the sad story .
__label__joy	Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks .
__label__joy	Ok . Maybe you should invite your sister along , too .
__label__surprise	Really ? Where do you work out at ?
__label__joy	That ’ s great ! I ’ ll go there right now and speak with the boss .
__label__joy	Oh , that's my great , great , great , great , great , great , great grandfather .
__label__joy	If you would like me to , I could help you with that .
__label__sadness	I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another . Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . How could I do such a thing ?
__label__joy	What a charming room ! It faces south , and there's such a lovely view of the city .
__label__disgust	It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture .
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__anger	I'll never get over it . Oh , Harry , it was all so unnecessary . That man ! ! How could he do this to us after we'd put him up ?
__label__joy	Yay !
__label__sadness	I have to make money to support the family , so I have little time left to share with you .
__label__joy	Shall we have dinner together ?
__label__surprise	Wow !
__label__joy	I'll appreciate it if it could be arranged .
__label__joy	I believe it . Hoo , this car corners like it's on rails .
__label__joy	My first time . I've traveled around Europe a lot , but this was my first time to Spain . It was amazing , and the weather was just beautiful ! No rain , and just sun , sun , sun ...
__label__joy	Congratulations . How lucky you are !
__label__joy	Good ! How much does the sea view stateroom cost for per person ?
__label__joy	I was planning to attend gradate school , but then I was offered a good job doing marketing , so I changed my mind .
__label__joy	that ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?
__label__surprise	Really ? Good luck for them .
__label__surprise	Look , Danny . The Four Great Inventions !
__label__joy	Don't worry , I'll drive you .
__label__joy	Thank you so much . I can't take this .
__label__surprise	Hey , How did you know I came from America ?
__label__sadness	Yes , everything . I feel overwhelmed by the daily work . Sometimes , I just can ’ t focus on what I am doing . What is worse , though I make plans for a whole week , I always have to make changes later on because other things come up . I can ’ t manage my time well . I can ’ t handle work well . I am afraid I was screw up more things .
__label__joy	That's exactly what I was thinking of .
__label__joy	Fine , thank you . And you ?
__label__joy	I want to take care of you forever . Will you marry me ?
__label__joy	That's exactly what I want , thank you .
__label__joy	Thanks for your compliment , but there is still plenty more to learn .
__label__joy	Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut .
__label__joy	I love it when the weather is like this.Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
__label__joy	About 80 million dollars .
__label__joy	Thank you . I'll bring your order right away .
__label__joy	I ’ d like to wish you every success in your new venture .
__label__joy	A little , but the rush was worth it .
__label__joy	Yes , the same as ever , thanks . What about you ?
__label__surprise	Oh , no .
__label__joy	No problem . Hope to see you again soon .
__label__joy	That is so nice of you .
__label__surprise	You ' re scared of spiders ? I actually have two more phobias . Acrophobia and glossophobia .
__label__joy	That sounds great . Is it casual ?
__label__joy	Good idea . That will help us to warm up .
__label__joy	Actually , we thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the holidays .
__label__joy	OK . Let's go American . Where's the nearest McDonald's ?
__label__joy	And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies . I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions .
__label__surprise	But how ? So you knew all along I was with WebTracker ? How did you know ?
__label__surprise	That's incredible !
__label__joy	My friend Jane is very beautiful .
__label__joy	She is very nice and open-minded .
__label__joy	Look at the museum guide.It says there are also some sculptures and potteries in this area . Let's rent an audio guide .
__label__joy	That sounds great ! I am craving some type of beef dish .
__label__joy	Very smart !
__label__joy	Very well , thank you . It's nice to meet you again . I am awfully sorry for not being able to meet you at the airport , as I was busy yesterday . I do hope you had a very enjoyable trip from New York .
__label__joy	Thanks . Gee , it's really light !
__label__joy	Fantastic ! Would you like a smoking or nonsmoking room ?
__label__joy	I was there for about three weeks .
__label__joy	You know , the one just on the corner with Oxford Street . There is a large pharmacy next door .
__label__fear	Not on your life ! I know I'd break my leg
__label__joy	No . I won't need to see anything except your driver's license .
__label__sadness	No . Only a few pounds . But my passport was in the bag . That ’ what I ’ m really worry about .
__label__surprise	Really ? I didn't expect that .
__label__joy	Got it ! I fit into that category very nicely . That's great ! I'll have a chat with my parents and come back . Thanks very much .
__label__joy	Oh my gosh ! Your hair is amazing ! So silky , so shiny ! I am going to work my magic on your hair ! You hear me ? You are going to look like a million bucks !
__label__joy	I'm glad to hear that .
__label__joy	Yeah , that's the one I've heard the special effects and the plot are outstanding .
__label__joy	Also it has low cost , and you know you only need to pay the fee of Internet , which is very cheap .
__label__sadness	Ashes to ashes and dust to dust ...
__label__anger	I have a bone to pick with you .
__label__joy	Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut .
__label__joy	Not at all . A party is a party . I'll be happy to come .
__label__joy	Let me see . Ah , yes , I've been to England , France , Germany , Italy and now I've been in Spain
__label__joy	Oh , that's easy for me . I think it's really a good deal .
__label__joy	You ’ re all set now ?
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	yeah , I'll call her later to patch things up .
__label__joy	OK . My wife sent me a message and asked me to go home just now . I am leaving .
__label__joy	Beautiful weather , isn ’ t it ?
__label__joy	That's great ; my health club membership is about to expire .
__label__joy	Oh , yes . I really like it here .
__label__joy	It sounds like this is going to be authentic Mexican food .
__label__joy	T he nineteenth of June is my birthday . I'm planning to have a small party . Could you come ?
__label__joy	How about tomorrow afternoon ?
__label__joy	Thank God , it's Friday ! Time for a drink ! Let's hit the bars !
__label__joy	It's snowing heavily .
__label__joy	I'm fine for now , thanks .
__label__joy	That's a good idea . You are really creative .
__label__joy	Let me see . Yes , that's it . Where did you find it ?
__label__joy	Yeah ! I called him after I got home to arrange our next date , but unfortunately his grandma is sick so he has been busy every night visiting her in the hospital .
__label__surprise	Really ? I've never heard that before . I just like it .
__label__joy	With pleasure . Get in .
__label__joy	Here's your receipt . Have a nice day .
__label__joy	maybe ... I'll think about it .
__label__sadness	I'm embarrassed ! I forgot completely about them . I'm terribly sorry .
__label__joy	Thank you for your love and care over the years . I love you so much .
__label__sadness	I'm afraid he is not in at the moment .
__label__joy	Thank you . It was a lot of hard work.But I'm glad I did it .
__label__anger	Yuck !
__label__joy	All right . We'll have some seafood and vegetables .
__label__joy	Yes , indeed , People say he's the smartest young man .
__label__sadness	Yeah , but it's hard to forget her at moment . You know , we were together for almost five years . It's really hard ...
__label__surprise	Really ? OK , I will try my best to be relaxed .
__label__joy	Oh , how interesting . And what about Larry and Rocky ?
__label__anger	Why don't you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything I have ?
__label__joy	Yes , please . Thank you for everything .
__label__surprise	Jessica , I am very sorry to hear that . Why are you leaving ?
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__sadness	Mr . Division , I am so sorry to have kept you waiting .
__label__anger	I simply can't bear your barbaric behavior .
__label__joy	Oh , good ! We can all get together again .
__label__joy	I just heard that you won the long-distance race . Congratulations on your victory .
__label__joy	And , as well as being a pleasure to work with , you ’ Ve been instrumental in helping us complete many key projects .
__label__joy	It's a great feeling .
__label__joy	It's no problem . I have time today , and I think it's important that you find a good place .
__label__joy	Okay , thanks .
__label__joy	Have a good day .
__label__joy	Think nothing of it .
__label__joy	Here's the check . I included a little extra for you .
__label__joy	Thank you , I'll be right back . Do you need any to go boxes ? I'd be glad to bring you some when I come back .
__label__joy	Good , I ' Ve get a two-pin plug .
__label__joy	Oh , that's fantastic !
__label__surprise	Wow , I have my own bathroom !
__label__joy	Great ! I'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . Could you tell me the detailed address ?
__label__sadness	I'm afraid I have to leave . I have to be up early tomorrow .
__label__sadness	I can ’ t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ’ m only doing this for you . I don ’ t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do .
__label__joy	Does she know how to speak Spanish ?
__label__joy	Well , except fishing . To be honest , I hate fishing , but I love all the others .
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome .
__label__joy	Yeah , I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . I'm starving !
__label__joy	Thanks a lot . I'm most grateful .
__label__joy	See you later ! Drive carefully .
__label__joy	Thank you for calling me . I will be there on time .
__label__joy	Yes , actually it ’ s my second visit . I was there last October .
__label__joy	A boss likes him a lot . He says Jim is a good team player .
__label__joy	Oh , Taylor ! I'm so ... so happy . But then ... who's that ?
__label__joy	Excellent ! I like it ! When can I move in ?
__label__joy	Prepare the list , Mother . I can go shopping . I can go to the small stores.Everyone knows me there .
__label__sadness	I'm afraid I can't .
__label__joy	Very good , sir . Your order will be ready in one week .
__label__sadness	That's terrible .
__label__joy	I'm getting a little short on cash . Let's just window shop a little .
__label__anger	You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding !
__label__joy	Of course . I can eat a horse now .
__label__anger	How on earth can you miss several buses ?
__label__joy	Thanks for your help .
__label__sadness	Wow . That sounds like a lot of fun . I am sorry I missed it .
__label__surprise	Really ? Are you willing to recommend me for the position ?
__label__surprise	But why ?
__label__joy	Thank you . This one looks nice . Is it near the university ?
__label__joy	I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
__label__joy	This balcony is perfect for barbecuing .
__label__joy	It's nice to finally meet you .
__label__joy	Oh , well , I've lost some weight . And my hair is longer than before .
__label__joy	Yes , not only a good way to keep in shape , but a good way to relieve stress as well . While you're stressed out by your commute , I'm releasing all the stress of the day with mine .
__label__joy	Beautifully done .
__label__joy	Sounds exciting . I can't wait .
__label__joy	I'm glad too . Steven , I want to tell you that I'm going to divorce my wife .
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__joy	Oh , I get it ! You want souvenirs !
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together .
__label__joy	Not at all .
__label__joy	I was the only one who got a strait A in my class .
__label__joy	Nick , it's very nice of you to see me off .
__label__joy	Well , Kristin did give me a hand with the slides.She ' s a real wiz on PowerPoint .
__label__joy	Is it real gold ?
__label__joy	Honey , seriously , It ’ s just a sheep . Relax ! Relax , that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable .
__label__joy	So funny . By stealing , I forgot all my sorrows and pressure from work .
__label__joy	The summers are so great here ! Not hot at all . I love the cooling breezes , the clear air , all the greenery .
__label__disgust	To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it .
__label__joy	That is good to know . Just think ! We've been worrying about this for weeks and just a short visit here and my mind is at ease . Thank you .
__label__joy	Paul , what kind of music do you like to listen to ?
__label__joy	Did you see the 2005 Grammy Awards on TV last night .
__label__surprise	Oops !
__label__joy	Are you crying ?
__label__joy	well , I think you'd be the perfect candidate for the position . According to company policy , you'll still have to go through the formal application procedures though , so fill this application form in
__label__joy	Everyone in our class enjoyed it too.It ' s very interesting .
__label__joy	Certainly .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	Why don ’ t you introduce him ? I wonder if we will become good friends .
__label__joy	That was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ?
__label__joy	All right . That sounds like fun .
__label__joy	yes , I adore simple fashions . How does it look on me ?
__label__joy	Thank you . I begin to like English even when I was a child .
__label__joy	That would be fine .
__label__surprise	Why ? What do you mean by that ?
__label__joy	I really enjoy the beach in the summer .
__label__anger	I can wait , but my toothache can't !
__label__surprise	Really ? I wish you could tell me more about your experience .
__label__surprise	So what did you do ?
__label__joy	Thank you , but it was your hard work that did it .
__label__anger	on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
__label__joy	Good afternoon , Sam .
__label__joy	Of course . I will .
__label__joy	Hello ! So you are leaving today .
__label__joy	How nice of you to say so .
__label__joy	Yeah , that's fine .
__label__joy	Bill and Betty have already grown up .
__label__joy	I wish it would stay this way for the weekend .
__label__joy	I know . He bought me that beautiful sweater for my birthday . It was exactly what I wanted . And it fit me perfectly !
__label__joy	I'm glad to hear that . I think it's the nicest city in the United States .
__label__anger	Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	I ’ m glad they ’ re coming in August . Maybe Greg and I can play some golf or get tickets to a baseball game .
__label__joy	( Sound of Allen singing ) Hey , Allen has a really good voice ! He sounds like Johnny Dean !
__label__joy	I said I like pop music very much.It ' s so lovely .
__label__anger	Certainly not .
__label__joy	All right . Thank you very much for your help .
__label__surprise	Really ? Is that why you wanted to come to the play ?
__label__joy	It ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the best actor and actress .
__label__sadness	I have little chance to communicate with colleagues when I have problems . They are always too busy to help a green hand like me .
__label__joy	I agree .
__label__joy	That was a very interesting presentation , Ms . Wang . My colleagues and I are very impressed with your proposal .
__label__anger	Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ?
__label__anger	what a bummer ! You set me up ?
__label__surprise	Really ? Do you think English is that important ?
__label__joy	Isn ’ t this great ? I always wanted to own a farm , live out in the country , grow my own food !
__label__joy	It sounds great . I'll take it .
__label__joy	Yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look .
__label__joy	It looks so beautiful . How much is it ?
__label__joy	thank you .
__label__joy	Yeah , that ’ s what I told her . I ’ m glad she ’ s reaching out for help , instead of trying to deal with this on her own .
__label__joy	Sounds good . I don ’ t want it to be too expensive , maybe something mid-range .
__label__joy	Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ?
__label__surprise	Seven dollars ! ! ! Incredible ! But I saw that the seller has kind of a bad rating .
__label__joy	OK.Let me make a wish ... Do you want a big piece of cake ?
__label__joy	Alright , then let's take an umbrella . Is your brother coming with us ?
__label__joy	Will you come to join us at dinner this evening ? My family will be happy to see you . And father misses you very much .
__label__joy	No problem , sir . Everything will be ready when you come back .
__label__joy	Well , I guess I could tape The X-files and watch it later ...
__label__joy	Thank you , Paul .
__label__joy	The buildings are really magnificent .
__label__sadness	No , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family to support .
__label__joy	That sounds fine , thanks for that . Let's go ahead !
__label__joy	Wow ! What a beautiful scenic spot . It's so open . And just breathe that fresh air , you can almost taste its freshness .
__label__joy	Great . I got to try so many things for the first time .
__label__joy	I did ! I found this lovely teapot . It was the best one I saw in the shops .
__label__joy	Joe , how are you doing ?
__label__anger	No ! ! !
__label__joy	OK . Bye !
__label__sadness	Please forgive me . You have my word . I'll spend some time with you on the weekend . I promise .
__label__joy	Absolutely . Mm , this is really good .
__label__joy	Oh I ’ m enjoying myself but it ’ s so hot here
__label__joy	The Spring Festival is drawing close . By then we will have five days off . I am expecting it .
__label__surprise	I didn't know you were a twin ! Are you identical or fraternal ?
__label__joy	I'm glad you told me .
__label__joy	You are so thoughtful .
__label__joy	Well , you should try my store . The prices are good .
__label__joy	Actually , why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in rush hour .
__label__joy	It's wrong because---it isn't true .
__label__joy	Do you have a special restaurant in mind ?
__label__sadness	Sorry , all the tables for three are reserved .
__label__sadness	No , I'm sorry we don't . We accept credit cards and cash .
__label__sadness	Wow !
__label__joy	Wow ! You look just as dorky as Dilbert !
__label__anger	How could I feel easy ? I ’ m really pissed .
__label__joy	Stay for dinner with us .
__label__joy	The final report is exceptionally thorough and well done . I think that you have been come up with some interesting recommendations for the client .
__label__surprise	Tragic movie ? I think it's a love story .
__label__surprise	Why ? You are so excellent .
__label__joy	Sounds pretty good . I see the equalizer has a good selection of settings .
__label__joy	Why not ?
__label__joy	It's very good , and it's fresh too .
__label__joy	Sounds like an interesting film . Let's meet at five o'clock on Saturday .
__label__joy	It ’ s a good thing that you read that ad today .
__label__joy	I'd love to . What date is it ?
__label__sadness	Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .
__label__sadness	I lost the table tennis game yesterday .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__disgust	You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea .
__label__joy	it ’ s so great to be here ! I ’ m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home !
__label__joy	Of course ! I bought two copies .
__label__surprise	What's this ? Essential oil ? Wow ! This stuff is expensive .
__label__surprise	What ? Why ? I mean , we ’ Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ’ re happy together , aren ’ t we ?
__label__joy	Yes , we should go . Thank you very much . Goodbye !
__label__surprise	Oh , no . What did I do ? It's asking me for a password .
__label__joy	You mean , we can do many other things after the picnic , right ?
__label__disgust	To tell you the truth , it's the most tedious course i have ever had .
__label__joy	Oh , a nice handkerchief . That's a great idea . I'll take it .
__label__joy	I'd love it . Working out is more fun with a friend .
__label__joy	It was my pleasure .
__label__joy	Bye .
__label__joy	Yes , it is . Thanks . I ’ m just surfing on the internet .
__label__joy	Don't mention it . I'm always willing to help good students .
__label__joy	The car has very sleek lines . I love it .
__label__joy	Mary , don't move . Stand right there . It's a good shot . The background is very pretty .
__label__joy	Where did you end up going ?
__label__surprise	Oh , my God , you're kidding me ! He carried him back ?
__label__anger	I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !
__label__sadness	Definitely , I ’ m really sorry .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , Mum .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__joy	Do bullfights interest you much ?
__label__joy	Oh , thank you very much . I ’ d like to come , but I ’ m afraid I ’ m busy that evening .
__label__joy	I'm sure you'll enjoy yourselves .
__label__joy	I see . Thank you .
__label__surprise	Oh , you're kidding ! I thought I was heading east .
__label__joy	Yes ! Yes ! And yes ! Jared , of course I ’ ll marry you !
__label__joy	Todd , I am so happy you called !
__label__joy	Thank you so much . I'll find the nearest branch and come in tomorrow . Thanks again for all of your help .
__label__surprise	That's amazing ! Really ? How could it change so much in two days ?
__label__joy	You're welcome at any time .
__label__joy	How about going for swim around 10
__label__joy	I had a wonderful time .
__label__disgust	Not yet , but I have to soon . He's eating me out of house and home . I caught him reading the fridge again last night
__label__joy	When are getting married ?
__label__joy	Great . Thanks for your help .
__label__joy	Great . Maybe we can study and play games together . I think we can be good friends .
__label__joy	Yes , of course . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	That's true .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	Can you go there with me ? I'd like someone who is familiar with that area to go with me .
__label__joy	Thank you . Hopefully I won't have to call about him again .
__label__anger	Well , obviously , what you ’ re doing is not good enough !
__label__joy	By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday .
__label__joy	I want you in bed , right now , so sweet dreams .
__label__surprise	But , you were born and raised in California !
__label__sadness	Sorry , the connection is terrible . I'll call you back because I can't hear anything .
__label__joy	You are so kind ! Thank you very much .
__label__joy	OK ! Let's go .
__label__joy	it's much better than my old one . My new boss is great .
__label__joy	Good luck to you .
__label__joy	Yes , it is !
__label__anger	What ’ s wrong ? I want a break from this horrible job .
__label__joy	Thank you so much , Lisa !
__label__joy	Oh , it's so quiet here . We have the park to ourselves , only you and me !
__label__joy	How happy you are ! Next Monday is your wedding day . Congratulations !
__label__joy	Fantastic ! Please send him my congratulations .
__label__anger	Fine ! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon !
__label__joy	I ’ ll be very glad if you would help .
__label__anger	How could you have done that without asking me first ?
__label__disgust	Oh , you are such a dog !
__label__joy	Yes , I like this one.It goes very well with my coat . How much is it ?
__label__joy	What a nice garden ! Look at these tulips !
__label__joy	I love swimming and cycling . On Saturday morning I usually ride my bike around the city or the country road for almost two hours .
__label__joy	cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar !
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	If you like the outside , you are going to really love the inside .
__label__joy	Absolutely ! They also have real Italian Galatian and French sorbets . They do a great baked Alaska .
__label__joy	I am glad that you have been happy with my performance .
__label__joy	It's really great to see you again . How about a drink tonight ?
__label__joy	You , too ! See you tomorrow .
__label__anger	I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair !
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Here you are .
__label__surprise	Why ?
__label__joy	Great . Here's my Visa Credit Card .
__label__surprise	Look ! He has a partner !
__label__joy	Yeah , tell me about it . I know ! Your mom is trying to learn Spanish , right ? Why don ’ t you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod .
__label__joy	He ’ s just got no idea of how good you are .
__label__joy	Yes , what a wonderful meal !
__label__sadness	Sorry I couldn't help you .
__label__joy	This is perfect ! What do you think ?
__label__joy	Oh , thank you . That ’ s very kind of you .
__label__joy	I see . Thank you .
__label__joy	That's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it .
__label__joy	Thank you !
__label__joy	Great play !
__label__anger	We have too many cars !
__label__joy	Sure . Thanks .
__label__joy	Fine , Mr . Grant . Thanks for your time .
__label__joy	Yeah . All of us tried our best .
__label__joy	4945939 . Marvellous ! Thanks for your help .
__label__joy	Yes , my father gave it to me for my birthday . Do you like it ?
__label__joy	I've never given a speech in front of a thousand people before .
__label__anger	I can't believe it . I can't believe I fell into your trap .
__label__joy	You are so kind . Thanks .
__label__joy	And the stove is brand new . You know how to use a gas stove , right ?
__label__joy	Store credit is okay with me . I'm sure I will find something I like . I shop here a lot .
__label__joy	Finally !
__label__disgust	Sorry to trouble you . But I don't think this fish is fresh . It actually tastes a bit off .
__label__joy	Great . You can help me a lot with English .
__label__joy	Yes , I recalled you charging that before . And I thought it was extortionate ! Haha !
__label__sadness	Oh dear , we will miss our train .
__label__joy	Well , if you want we can go together sometime . Actually I was thinking of going this afternoon , if you like , you can join me and I can show you the neighborhood along the way .
__label__sadness	Well , I confess . I did it , because I urgently need money to buy some medicine for my mother for she is badly ill . I'm ashamed that I did that .
__label__surprise	I also have a doubt . Oh , kill me softly , she is May .
__label__joy	Yes . Many things ! I especially love this beautiful quilt .
__label__anger	That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying !
__label__surprise	Oh , dear . How can I wait for such a long time ?
__label__joy	I've already made a hotel reservation for you , let's go to the hotel first and drop off your things . Then , I'd like to have a drink so that we can get better acquainted . I've booked a table at an exclusive restaurant downtown . Afterwards , I've made arrangements to take you to see the city lights . Seattle ’ s nightlife can be really quite exciting . How does that schedule sound to you ?
__label__joy	OK ! Then what can I do after I finish it ?
__label__joy	So , you'll be at my birthday party on Friday ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much for doing this interview .
__label__joy	No . Thank you .
__label__joy	Thank you . I have been working on it for several years .
__label__joy	Thanks , you too , how see your maxes sometime .
__label__joy	Here we are , Ryan ! This is where we're going to celebrate !
__label__surprise	Your cat spends most of the day outdoors ' , right ? Do you kino where she goes ?
__label__sadness	I am awfully sorry but there are no vacancies left now . Would you like to wait for a moment ?
__label__joy	We spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
__label__surprise	How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
__label__joy	It is . I hope you ’ ll have time to come for a visit soon . You really should come during the summer , when the weather is better and there ’ s more happening outdoors .
__label__sadness	I ’ m fine . But I have bad news .
__label__joy	Thanks for all your help .
__label__sadness	Perhaps . I'm dead tired .
__label__joy	Certainly.How do you like to have it made ?
__label__joy	That's good . When can I go to see the house ?
__label__joy	Very Good . I'd like to do that .
__label__joy	that sounds good to me . I really appreciate it .
__label__joy	My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink .
__label__joy	So Barb ... what do you do ?
__label__joy	I can do that . Do you have anyone that you would like to bring with you to the party ?
__label__surprise	Why ?
__label__joy	Yes , I have . They do an excellent job .
__label__surprise	Bob !
__label__joy	What a nice tie you are wearing !
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__surprise	Really ? I'm sorry . I did not know that .
__label__joy	So we can relax now .
__label__joy	He came in too fast , jammed on the breaks and spun out . We have a yellow flag and the pace car is making its way onto the track .
__label__sadness	Nothing . I just feel very lonely in this city . I miss my family .
__label__joy	I like pop music very much .
__label__anger	Then , why didn't you try to prevent it in the beginning ?
__label__joy	Goodbye .
__label__sadness	This house is very nice for me , but I can ’ t afford it in a lump sum .
__label__joy	Can you tell me how to improve myself ?
__label__joy	Thanks a lot . I'm so touched .
__label__sadness	I just had a terrible week .
__label__joy	That ’ s great . Where did you stay ?
__label__joy	You are smart .
__label__joy	Either way is good for me .
__label__joy	I'm grateful to you .
__label__fear	I hate dentists .
__label__joy	No , but thanks for offering , actually could you bring some fold-up chairs for people if you have any ? I am afraid not everyone's going to have a seat , do you have any ?
__label__joy	Sarah and I could see eye to eye with each other .
__label__joy	Yeah , many of my friends like Chinese tea and whenever I go back to China , I'll take some Dragon-well green tea for them .
__label__joy	Thank you . Mmm . Can you tell me about the terrine ?
__label__joy	Good idea . It is always cooler in a shade .
__label__joy	Deeper , softer , none of your twittering larks . I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupted her song .
__label__joy	Good idea , Betty . What would you think about the second part ?
__label__joy	Tom , Christmas Day is coming . Merry Christmas to you .
__label__joy	Thank you . I just got these shoes today .
__label__surprise	Are you crying ?
__label__joy	May and Danny have already grown up .
__label__joy	Don't worry . Bye .
__label__joy	No problem , John .
__label__disgust	Oh , it's really a drag .
__label__joy	It's too good to be true .
__label__joy	Yes , It's only eight forty . Thanks so much !
__label__joy	Yes . That's perfect . I'll take it .
__label__joy	Thank you . Well , if you ever pass my home , please drop in .
__label__sadness	Did I do something wrong ?
__label__joy	Okay . Thank you for your reminder .
__label__sadness	Lucy is known as a social butterfly . She has taken many rich men for a ride , you know .
__label__fear	I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ?
__label__joy	Morning , Zina . Just wanted to say thanks again !
__label__joy	Yes . I'm sure he will . I'll take it .
__label__joy	Wow ! You're right ! This refrigerator is great . I'll take it .
__label__joy	That would be great .
__label__joy	All you have to do is ask for help .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__sadness	Oh , Steven , I made a big mistake .
__label__joy	Of course , and I also like the rhythms .
__label__joy	Thank you for your help .
__label__disgust	I've had enough of that !
__label__joy	Oh yes , everyone we are inviting is from our company .
__label__sadness	I am sorry to have kept all of you waiting . I was delayed by something urgent .
__label__sadness	Sorry , our prices are set .
__label__joy	I'm always at your service .
__label__joy	I get it . You want to find a guide , don ’ t you ?
__label__joy	Hmm , that's good . Can you use cedar or redwood to build it ?
__label__sadness	It is depressing to hear the price goes higher and higher .
__label__anger	They're incredibly selfish . They ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep !
__label__joy	What would you like to drink ?
__label__joy	It ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean .
__label__anger	I know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning .
__label__joy	Good idea . I ’ d be very happy to go there .
__label__sadness	I just started , but the job market is very bad right now . I'm not optimistic about it .
__label__surprise	Why ? I mean , why did she part company with you after seven years together ?
__label__joy	That would be great ! You are really a good employee .
__label__joy	Nice to see you , Mrs . Anderson .
__label__joy	Thank you so much .
__label__joy	I'm going to take more pictures today .
__label__joy	Yes , and I like the color too . It matches your eyes .
__label__surprise	Really ? Why is that ?
__label__sadness	I'm frustrated .
__label__anger	That's fine , because if I leave , then your rules won't matter .
__label__surprise	You ’ re kidding . It can ’ t be true .
__label__joy	This is my favourite restaurant .
__label__anger	That ’ s more than my round-trip ticket !
__label__joy	Bye .
__label__anger	That ’ s what you said the last time ! If you want to smoke , you ’ ll have to use your break time and go outside !
__label__joy	Good luck here .
__label__joy	Thank you . Here's a present for you .
__label__joy	Not at all .
__label__joy	Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
__label__joy	I'm dead serious . They've decided that it's too small to be a planet , but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot
__label__joy	Ha-ha , so you believe in astrology ?
__label__surprise	You mean you haven ’ t arranged any car ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__surprise	Gosh !
__label__joy	Sure , they do .
__label__joy	That sounds all right to us .
__label__joy	Thanks , next time I'll make chicken soup for us .
__label__joy	Never mind , it doesn't matter .
__label__joy	That's good . Not Evey company provides employees with training opportunity . It seems that your company wants to further develop their employees and encouragelifelong learning .
__label__joy	Oh , you've already grown up , son .
__label__joy	Thanks . Let's go for a celebration this evening . Are you free ?
__label__joy	This is the best dinner I've ever had .
__label__joy	That ’ s great . What are the prizes ?
__label__anger	I don't think that I ever heard of that rule before . Any more rules that you would like to tell me about ?
__label__surprise	Really ? No , they couldn't . None of them would have jobs if they did .
__label__joy	Well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon .
__label__joy	That's a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense .
__label__joy	That sounds nice .
__label__sadness	I just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking.It ' s so lonely and boring . My sickness makes it worse . When will I recover ?
__label__joy	You'll be out to see me next year , as you promised ?
__label__joy	Well , how did you enjoy your seaside trip ?
__label__sadness	I would like that Anna , but I think I ’ ll need a little space for a bit .
__label__joy	Of course , just five minutes ago I got the phone call from Future Clothes Company and I was told to start my trial period in that company next Monday .
__label__joy	If you need any further information , please don't hesitate to ask me .
__label__joy	Well , what a nice day !
__label__joy	It's very kind of you .
__label__joy	I am sorry for that . I was so attracted by the beautiful scenery .
__label__joy	Sounds interesting . Especially that we are Olympic Volunteers .
__label__joy	I just got a telegram from Margaret and Greg .
__label__joy	Just as usual , you know .
__label__joy	OK , thank you .
__label__joy	Pretty well . What about you ?
__label__joy	You like it . Well , I'll gather in for you .
__label__sadness	You know , all I was trying to do was tell the truth but they obviously didn ’ t take it that way .
__label__anger	Crazy is too kind . Insane is more like it . Nuts ! Wacko ! Psycho !
__label__joy	The shuttle launches are beautiful . I saw one that took off at midnight . The whole sky got bright .
__label__joy	That is greatly appreciated and I hope you feel well enough to go to school tomorrow .
__label__surprise	Really ? Does she live here in Seattle ?
__label__joy	Yes , that would work out better .
__label__joy	That is awesome . Congratulation ! I know you can make it .
__label__joy	Yes , I do , very much .
__label__joy	It is December 25th .
__label__anger	Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash .
__label__joy	Happy New Year , Steven .
__label__sadness	Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
__label__sadness	I miss grandma . I dreamed about her yesterday .
__label__joy	Well , I'm no movie expert , but those special effects were impressive by any standards .
__label__joy	Perfect . I also wanted to know if there is any call forwarding service ? I am usually out of town and would like my calls to be forwarded to a local number .
__label__sadness	I'm very sorry to have caused you this trouble .
__label__joy	So I ’ Ve got two tickets to the latest show but I need a little favor from you .
__label__joy	Yes . Very wonderful .
__label__joy	That's really nice . I'd like this one . It looks very attractive .
__label__joy	Sure . The fitting room is in the corner .
__label__joy	Thank you very much , that's kind of you .
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? Would you transfer to another company if it is not what you expected ?
__label__surprise	Really ? Then what do you do with it ?
__label__joy	Come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry .
__label__anger	You told Martha that I was on a date ? What was that all about ?
__label__joy	OK . I will write to you as soon as I get there .
__label__joy	Ahahah , and I thought you were tired .
__label__surprise	Oh , my God ! I'm going to be late ! I have no time to have breakfast now . ( Hurry on his clothes . )
__label__sadness	That ’ s a lot of money .
__label__surprise	500 feet ! I would never be able to do that .
__label__joy	Just come to our house and stay over . You'll sit by his bed and greet him like a beautiful red rose , ' Good morning ! '
__label__joy	Hey !
__label__joy	Good morning , Mr . Huang . It's a pleasure to meet you again .
__label__joy	I ’ m starving , too . There is a new Chinese restaurant close by . Do you want to go there for lunch ?
__label__joy	Thank you.That ' s the result of exercise .
__label__surprise	What ? Why didn ’ t you tell me before ? What are you doing here ?
__label__joy	It ’ s a special kind of Chinese herb . It ’ s good for you !
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Hey , that was quite the presentation ! Honestly , I was completely blown away by your strategy outline . I've gotta say , Alex , you really wowed me today .
__label__joy	No problem . Thank you for hiring me , I am very proud to be employed by your company and I will come in at eight o ’ clock sharp Monday .
__label__joy	Thank you so much .
__label__joy	I will . Thanks . That's sweet of you .
__label__sadness	I beg your pardon for being late .
__label__joy	It must be very convenient and pretty quick .
__label__joy	That sounds great !
__label__joy	Yes , it's so helpful .
__label__joy	That ’ s a great employment benefit !
__label__joy	Now you know why I wanted to work for the Post Office !
__label__joy	I ’ ll have to try it . You know how I am about Italian food ! What ’ s the name ?
__label__joy	I see . Well , can I have a look at your phone ? Unfortunately , this phone can ’ t be used in the US . it ’ s not compatible with our 3G network .
__label__joy	Glad to hear it .
__label__joy	You have been doing a great job this year and I am very satisfied with your work .
__label__disgust	What a terrible house !
__label__surprise	You're kidding !
__label__joy	Yes , this runway is going to sparkle with glamour and style !
__label__joy	Sure thing .
__label__joy	Thanks so much . I owe you one .
__label__joy	I forgot what I put up with in that case . I do deserve these flowers .
__label__surprise	At the age of 64 ? You're kidding !
__label__anger	Joan is a thorough drag !
__label__joy	Hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
__label__disgust	I left after the opening dance . I couldn't wait to get out of there .
__label__joy	Absolutely right.He gave a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto.That caused a sensation.The audience were stunned by his pure tone .
__label__joy	Oh great , I ’ ll see you there !
__label__joy	Ashley , what a great dinner party !
__label__joy	It's my dream .
__label__joy	I love apartment hunting . I ’ ll be happy to go with you .
__label__anger	What is that ?
__label__joy	Mm . What came after that ?
__label__joy	I think that April would work . Spring is a lovely time to be in the mountains .
__label__surprise	But that makes thirteen people ! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday !
__label__joy	Thank you.Ah ! But this is in French.Would you mind giving me the English menu ?
__label__joy	You will be a very promising one .
__label__joy	OK . I look forward to working with you . Enjoy your week !
__label__joy	In college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ?
__label__joy	Of course , I like it very much . Thank you .
__label__joy	Yes . we can get what we need at the stands right by the lake . Who do you think will catch a big fish first ?
__label__joy	I'm sure your wife will love them .
__label__joy	Well , uh , I'll let you decided that for you yourself . He'll be here a little later . Here's our room .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	Exactly !
__label__sadness	Shall we keep pur friendship ?
__label__joy	Yes , thank you so much .
__label__joy	Right , she is so excited and simply can ’ t wait .
__label__joy	Thanks , Tim.Nice meeting you , too .
__label__joy	We have mild wines and strong liquors . Which kind do you prefer ?
__label__joy	It's nice to be here .
__label__joy	We have a deal then .
__label__joy	Have you tried these little ditties ? They are really good .
__label__sadness	Oh , I'm afraid we've sold out of those . They were really popular .
__label__joy	This is your voucher , and you can get your luggage back on this . Have a good trip !
__label__joy	Super !
__label__surprise	Really ? I'm surprised . I didn't know his English was that good .
__label__anger	I've never been to such a dirty restaurant , and never seen such slow service .
__label__joy	That is true . Some people go camping , some people pick fresh fruit , some people go boating and some people go grass skiing .
__label__anger	I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that !
__label__joy	Great , have a good day , thanks again for the offer .
__label__joy	I'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got a partner .
__label__joy	Oh , yes . Just show me where the fitting rooms are now . I can't wait to try this on .
__label__surprise	Wow , you ’ re up early today ! What ’ s for breakfast ?
__label__joy	No problem at all .
__label__joy	You certainly do like teasing me , Mary . Well I'm in love with someone . The question is , how do I get his attention ?
__label__anger	I can ’ t believe she would do that to you . It ’ s so dishonest---and rude !
__label__joy	Yes . There are so many famous paintings on show . I am sure it will be an unforgettable trip .
__label__joy	You must be lonely . I will share my friends with you .
__label__surprise	What ? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's , he said he was coming .
__label__joy	It ’ s a new phrase that she taught us today . It means that I will not only pass the class , but I will do extremely well !
__label__anger	Yes . And they don ’ t give you very much either . I ’ m still hungry .
__label__joy	Yes , With pleasure .
__label__joy	OK , here's to your health .
__label__joy	I've been invited over to a friend's . And you ?
__label__joy	Oh yeah ! Almost forgot ! I need to take fundamental linguistics , consumer psychology and neuroanatomy .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__sadness	Oh , My God ! That's terrible .
__label__sadness	I ’ m so sorry to hear that .
__label__joy	One glass of red wine coming up !
__label__joy	Thank you . Also , how can I get my mailbox key ?
__label__anger	Don't you think it's about time you got them working properly ?
__label__joy	Wait ! Congratulations ! You are the lucky customer of our anniversary celebration .
__label__joy	We look forward to your early reply and trust that through our mutual cooperation we shall be able to conclude this transaction with you in the near future .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Good night then .
__label__joy	I am also impressed with the lines in the movie .
__label__joy	Okay . I guess I could give it a try .
__label__joy	I've never been better , thanks .
__label__joy	OK . Here you are .
__label__joy	Bottoms up !
__label__joy	That's wonderful ! I like swimming .
__label__disgust	Not really . I thought it was disappointing .
__label__joy	I can't believe they would play so good .
__label__joy	Thank you , Mr . Jackson .
__label__sadness	I knew there would be a catch !
__label__surprise	You got lost . You're kidding !
__label__joy	Yes , surely .
__label__joy	Really . The special effects are fantastic.You shouldn't be scared . You would really enjoy it .
__label__fear	I am so worried about this English contest . I have butterflies in my stomach now !
__label__anger	We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet !
__label__joy	My poor memory . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Well , thanks for letting me know .
__label__joy	Thanks , Vivian .
__label__joy	After eating , we will take down our tent . Then we will pack everything into the canoe , We can shove off by 6
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? I go to the rye every day .
__label__joy	I was away for my vacation .
__label__joy	I'll call the tourist information centre to check .
__label__joy	It seems that you are an optimistic man who doesn't dismay easily . That is what a good salesman needs . Good luck .
__label__sadness	No , I ’ m sorry . I'm going to meet some friends tomorrow evening . And I'm in a hurry now .
__label__joy	That ’ s perfect .
__label__joy	Me either . From the very first page , this author just pulled me right in !
__label__joy	It is beautiful ! Look , there are so many birds around it .
__label__joy	Hi ! I'm Nancy . Nice to meet you .
__label__surprise	That's absurd .
__label__surprise	No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it !
__label__joy	Yes.it serves excellent Sichuan food . Spicy food may improve your appetite .
__label__joy	Thanks , Jane .
__label__sadness	I'll have us ready for Stars.com by the end of next week . After that , I don't know .
__label__joy	That's great ! You need to prepare for it .
__label__joy	Thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me ! I ’ Ve always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me ! Let ’ s get started !
__label__joy	How about some fish ?
__label__joy	Tell him I hope he's better soon .
__label__joy	Great . This is exactly what I was looking for . I'll buy it .
__label__joy	I want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything .
__label__surprise	Pink !
__label__joy	Well , I wish you luck here .
__label__joy	Thank you.How much is the fare to that stop ?
__label__joy	What's on the program ?
__label__joy	No problem , Madam . Should I check the air in the spare tyre as well ?
__label__sadness	I'm sorry . There are no sales today .
__label__surprise	Really ? I have been there several times .
__label__joy	How did you first meet Jack each other ?
__label__joy	Well , breakdancing is more a physical exercise than a dance .
__label__joy	Nice to meet you , George . I'm Irene .
__label__joy	Last but not least , we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich . We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper , or we can combine mustard sauce , mayonnaise , ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor ! It ’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt !
__label__anger	Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	No , I'll go by myself , thanks .
__label__joy	Good Point !
__label__joy	Thank you . In fact , I am in a hurry . My wife is waiting for me at the parking lot .
__label__joy	It seems a glorious day today .
__label__joy	Great idea . There is a travel agency nearby who would love to be our sponsor . It's a perfect chance for them to promote ethnic tourism .
__label__sadness	But she did and it made me disappointed .
__label__joy	Me too , Todd ! Thanks for suggesting that great movie .
__label__joy	I just can't wait to see them . Which one do you choose today ?
__label__joy	I'm better now . Want to play again ?
__label__joy	Ah yes , that is a great refrigerator .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	Hi , Ellen . That outfit looks terrific !
__label__joy	Here you are .
__label__joy	Okay , let's go !
__label__joy	Yup , better for the environment and better for us !
__label__joy	That sounds great .
__label__joy	An excellent idea . Work now and play later .
__label__joy	No , thanks .
__label__joy	Very well , thanks , I will probably finish next week , but this is still a lot of work , I have been worked on in for six months , and i ' m so closed to end . I can fill in .
__label__joy	Jenny , are you having fun here ?
__label__anger	You mean like a bus ? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ?
__label__joy	Let ’ s just hope my teacher agrees .
__label__surprise	You can't be serious .
__label__joy	That ’ s interesting . They must be thinking of moving into that market . Are there any interesting editorials ?
__label__joy	Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
__label__surprise	Surprise ?
__label__joy	OK , let's go .
__label__joy	Hi , darling ! I have a one-month vacation saved up . How about a trip to Europe ?
__label__surprise	Really ? I ’ m surprised .
__label__sadness	It is a long story . Basically , she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't .
__label__joy	Bye .
__label__joy	Okay , they'll be ready for you in an hour .
__label__joy	Cedar is a good choice .
__label__surprise	I ran a red light ?
__label__sadness	What a pity ! I should have come earlier .
__label__joy	How are your cases coming along ?
__label__surprise	Ten days ? Would you please repeat it again ?
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Why not ? I'd love to do that .
__label__sadness	Sorry to bother you . But I ’ m having a small problem I thought you might be able to help me with .
__label__joy	Thanks . I'll call again when things get better at home .
__label__joy	Thank youse much for all your help .
__label__joy	Your dream will come true . It's really breathtaking
__label__joy	The touchdown lines are there and there . OK , let's play !
__label__joy	I ’ m glad to meet you , Mr . Song .
__label__joy	Looks good .
__label__surprise	Wow , What a long queue this is !
__label__joy	It's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike . These are really expensive !
__label__joy	So he will make a perfect husband . Make sure you will be here next Monday .
__label__joy	Don ’ t mention it . It ’ s my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ?
__label__surprise	Oh , you wrote them all by yourself . That's amazing ! Are you a regular singer here ?
__label__disgust	Anyway , I don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that .
__label__joy	Which film shall we see ?
__label__surprise	Why ? I mean , what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
__label__joy	Well , thanks for the compliment anyway !
__label__joy	I think John is the best player on the field .
__label__joy	I will enjoy seeing you ; have a good week !
__label__joy	Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light . The best choices here are evident — cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , sweet pepper or chilli , lettuce and , of course , herbs — you can ’ t go wrong with them . As for aubergines , mushrooms and asparagus , I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil .
__label__sadness	Sorry , I am not sure , can I take a message ?
__label__joy	Not much , just a house party with some friends .
__label__joy	Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones .
__label__sadness	Oh , I'm sorry .
__label__joy	Maybe it's more exciting not knowing .
__label__joy	Thanks . I appreciate it .
__label__joy	Thank you , you too .
__label__surprise	I've never seen anything like it .
__label__joy	He is really great . He has sold millions of records worldwide . He is especially known for his rocking performance at the football World Cup song-the Cup of World .
__label__surprise	You're kidding .
__label__anger	This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it .
__label__disgust	I know what you mean , it leaves a lot to be desired .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	That's a good idea . I almost forget it.What else ?
__label__joy	It ’ s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
__label__joy	It's a girl .
__label__joy	That sounds interesting !
__label__anger	To hell with you . The accident was your fault .
__label__joy	Goodbye !
__label__joy	Alright , the puck is back in play now . Pavel Bure is on a breakaway ! He is flying down the ice ! The defenders can ’ t keep up ! Slap shot ! He scores .
__label__joy	Good morning , Miss Monica . Nice to meet you again !
__label__disgust	I hate the hero.He ' s too cruel .
__label__sadness	I ’ m sorry.She isn ’ t in at the momment.She will come back at half past nine.Can I take a message for her ?
__label__joy	That sounds like fun .
__label__joy	You won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ’ Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime !
__label__surprise	500 feet ! I would never be able to do that .
__label__joy	It ’ s Alex ... Have I got some great news ! We got the Baker account . It ’ s all ours !
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome .
__label__joy	Hum ... OK . I will take it .
__label__joy	This is just for you . Cheers ! Bottoms up .
__label__joy	Thank you for saying that . It's a present from my girlfriend .
__label__anger	Oh , come on ! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying . You ’ re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues , rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks .
__label__joy	I had broken up with him , how painful I feel . I ’ m going to drown my sorrows .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Do you want to go out for dinner tonight ?
__label__joy	Ok great , I ’ ll see you at six .
__label__joy	We should come here more often .
__label__joy	Well , I heard that last year Vivian from accounting won a new car !
__label__surprise	That ’ s amazing ! You got a good pay here , didn ’ t you ?
__label__joy	I hear that you have been promoted . Congratulations on your promotion !
__label__anger	We'll see how much fun it is after they take all your money ! !
__label__joy	That's cool . Care for a little quiz on that ?
__label__joy	Very well . We started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done .
__label__anger	I simply couldn ’ t help giving him the fish-eye when I knew all that .
__label__joy	I'm glad that you can make it .
__label__joy	Hello . Thank you for seeing me off . You actually don't need to bother .
__label__joy	Mary , I will have an interview tomorrow . I am so excited !
__label__joy	Great . Sweet wines are my favorite . They always make a great finish to a decisions meal .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	I want a different hair style .
__label__joy	Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun , too .
__label__joy	Whoa , look at all those ice cream choices !
__label__joy	Seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? That's a good idea . Let's go !
__label__joy	I was thinking of holding the company retreat in the mountains .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Thank you . I appreciate your help .
__label__joy	I knew some day I would be able to profit from your love of fun !
__label__joy	That ’ s it for today . Thank you .
__label__joy	I'm going to Japan this year on vacation .
__label__joy	Yeah , it was scary , but exhilarating .
__label__joy	That's a great idea ! Why didn't I think of that ?
__label__joy	OK .
__label__joy	Thank you . I will need a cashier ’ s check or cash , please .
__label__joy	Now , that's a price that I like .
__label__joy	It certainly is . It's so much fun .
__label__anger	The new computer software is driving me crazy ! I really need a break !
__label__joy	He's quite a patient teacher , too .
__label__joy	It's got to be almost a year now .
__label__sadness	But mum , we're watching this movie .
__label__joy	Well , yes . Thanks , there's no trouble at the moment .
__label__disgust	the food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone .
__label__joy	thank you , I'll wait here .
__label__joy	Oh ! Thank you .
__label__joy	You really have keen eyes .
__label__joy	OK , that's perfect , 70 % is excellent , it'll be a big help . Thanks .
__label__joy	Umm . yeah ! Right ! I got the car started ! Thanks for your help ! I told you to fill the tank !
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment .
__label__joy	Great ! I'll sing , and you can dance in our band .
__label__joy	Me too . Send you a kiss ...
__label__joy	Hey , That's a really nice outfit you have on .
__label__fear	What you said gives me the creeps !
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Yes , but I still don't have many friends here yet .
__label__joy	Let me see . We can visit the country . We haven't done that for such a long time .
__label__joy	That's a good idea !
__label__joy	He is fine .
__label__joy	Yeah , you can make it .
__label__joy	OK . I'll take one .
__label__joy	Certainly , sir.Would you sign here , please ? ... Thank you .
__label__joy	Of course . Here you are .
__label__joy	She was pretty , her hair was the color of rich dark chocolate , waving gently to her shoulders . Her complexion was clear and golden .
__label__surprise	What ? The meeting was proponed ? No one told me anything about it .
__label__disgust	I found it very disappointing .
__label__joy	I'm glad you came . You're welcome anytime .
__label__joy	He ’ s really good looking , he ’ s quite tall , around 6 ’ 1 ” , he ’ s in his early thirties , and he ’ s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes ...
__label__joy	Mom , I just finished my paper . Can you proofread it before I hand it in ?
__label__sadness	well , last night I had a big argument with Ann .
__label__sadness	I'm afraid I have to return this sweater .
__label__joy	Well , just finish the request and we will contact you when the supplies come in . Have a good day !
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Ok . I can't wait to see it . Let's go !
__label__joy	Yes , I'll have another cocktail .
__label__joy	And she's good at sports , too . She knows how to play tennis and basketball .
__label__joy	We rappelled down the side of a 300 - foot cliff . It's very exciting .
__label__joy	Well , no-that is , I've heard Linda say they do , but ... Thank you . But please don't speak to me again .
__label__joy	Oh , thank you , Mary . You're so nice .
__label__joy	All right , see you then .
__label__joy	Actually , my mother made it from scratch .
__label__surprise	I'm leaving on Sunday . We're going to Canada .
__label__joy	Yeah , and all those fun summer sports and activities .
__label__joy	Yes , It's supposed to be outstanding .
__label__joy	Certainly . The vegetarian pizza looks pretty good . It must be very delicious .
__label__joy	Thank you for a very enjoyable evening and your hospitality .
__label__joy	Ha-ha . I get it . That's funny . Your cousin's a real sarcastic lady .
__label__surprise	Really ? Where does he fly ? Does he fly to other countries ?
__label__joy	That is very kind of you . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	That would be great .
__label__surprise	You are kidding .
__label__joy	They all have essence of flowers in them .
__label__joy	Are you sure ? I don't want to inconvenience you .
__label__joy	I like the sound of that . I'll just come back next weekend .
__label__joy	Sure . That makes a good fan . Do you know what songs she is gonna sing tonight ?
__label__sadness	I swear I never drink again . Just give me another chance , please .
__label__joy	I am happy that we ’ Ve finally cleared up some problems .
__label__joy	Yes . It's snowing outside . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms .
__label__joy	Yes . The ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth , and they have developed into a festival filled with food , performances and games now .
__label__joy	( ha ha ) I ’ ll keep that in mind , but don ’ t tell my husband .
__label__joy	Would you like tea or coffee ?
__label__anger	Why not ?
__label__surprise	Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .
__label__joy	How about a movie on Sunday , Mum ?
__label__joy	Glad you like it .
__label__joy	Don't mention it.You ' re always been good.What do you say we go out to celebrate ?
__label__joy	Good idea .
__label__joy	That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application .
__label__joy	I'll take them .
__label__joy	Sure . We can walk around to that path that leads into the woods there . Hey , look ! There are some wild ducks over there in the reeds .
__label__joy	I am really pleased with it .
__label__sadness	That's disappointing . I was really looking forward to it .
__label__surprise	Really ? Why ? What happened ?
__label__joy	Art galleries , cathedrals , statues , fountains , palaces , bistros , there's really too much to say .
__label__joy	I suppose the local one .
__label__joy	Let me check the reservation list . Fortunately , we have just 10 standard rooms available for the three days .
__label__joy	Have a nice journey ! Do give my regards to your parents .
__label__joy	Yeah , it reminds you why they say baseball is America ’ s favorite pastime .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	Yeah . It's so nice of you to comfort me .
__label__anger	Oh , so it was my fault , was it ? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse .
__label__joy	I honestly think it looks great .
__label__joy	Look at that big tree over there .
__label__disgust	Not really . I thought it was disappointing .
__label__joy	That's wonderful . Congratulations .
__label__joy	Good night , sleep tight ; don ’ t let the bed bugs bite !
__label__joy	Sure . Bring enough films , please .
__label__joy	Not at all . I ’ ll be glad to do it .
__label__joy	Hi , Sally ! You are talking to the proud father of a new baby girl !
__label__anger	Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !
__label__surprise	Oh , yeah ? Which team ?
__label__joy	No ! It's a perfect fit !
__label__joy	Jim , I heard you ’ Ve bought a new computer .
__label__disgust	No , I ' m sorry . I'm going to meet some friends tomorrow evening . And I ' m too tired now . I have to go to sleep . Goodbye .
__label__fear	I don ’ t feel sick , ... let me check ... Nope ! No fever , I ’ m fine .
__label__joy	I'm doing really well .
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? So , Spain is through to the next round ?
__label__sadness	Skim , please . That'd be very nice . Thanks ... oh no . Janna , I'm so sorry , but I've got to go .
__label__joy	How is everything going on ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Tom , I've got good news for you .
__label__joy	it started off a bit slow , but now , business is really booming !
__label__joy	Great ! Pick me up in about an hour because I think I ’ ll also get a bean bag and a dining set .
__label__joy	There are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts .
__label__joy	Thank you . Anything else ?
__label__joy	People who play ultimate Frisbee have a positive attitude ; maybe you should join the ultimate Frisbee club .
__label__joy	Good-bye . Miss Li , say hello to your husband and your son for me . See you soon .
__label__joy	My love will grow , like a river to flow .
__label__joy	A lot of things . There is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . You really should read it .
__label__joy	Thank you . Where is your key ?
__label__sadness	I'm now on the Songshan airport getting ready for departure . I realized that I might have left my watch .
__label__joy	Yes , I usually develop and print all my own photos .
__label__joy	Well , take a look at everything and figure out what is best for you . Good luck !
__label__joy	Thank you very much . Here's 10 $ , keep the change , please .
__label__joy	OK , that'd be very nice .
__label__sadness	My father failed in business .
__label__surprise	Really ? How was it ?
__label__surprise	Really ? He looks so young .
__label__joy	Absolutely . I bought them from the King's estate myself ! Tell you what-I'll let you have five for one hundred bucks .
__label__sadness	Oh doctor , I feel so foolish .
__label__joy	Oh ! It's so cute !
__label__joy	Don ’ t worry about it , just ask .
__label__joy	That's great ! What time will it start at ?
__label__joy	It ’ s so cool !
__label__surprise	Oh John , I thought we said we would start eating right ! Remember ? Our new healthy lifestyle ? That ’ s all junk food !
__label__joy	Hello Mei , How about going for a meal this evening ?
__label__joy	It looks wonderful . Very authentic .
__label__joy	OK ! Before that I'll take this one as you .
__label__joy	Thank you for returning my call .
__label__joy	That's right .
__label__joy	Thank you . And a merry Christmas to you !
__label__sadness	No , I'm not .
__label__joy	Thanks , I will , byebye !
__label__joy	I appreciate that .
__label__joy	Merry Christmas !
__label__joy	Have a glass of wine , Mr . Wu ? And let me introduce you to some of my guests .
__label__joy	How do you like the pizza here ?
__label__joy	That one truly is a beautiful piece of work , isn't it ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	That's good to know , because I do travel quite frequently .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__surprise	No kidding ! What happened to Ad ?
__label__anger	You said the same thing three months ago .
__label__joy	That ’ s wonderful ! You must be really proud of him !
__label__joy	How did you know that I love red roses ?
__label__surprise	Oh I forgot ! I'll run home real quickly and bring you the money .
__label__joy	That sounds about right .
__label__joy	How's your married life ?
__label__joy	Hi Amy , you look very happy .
__label__joy	You look so young .
__label__anger	Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at .
__label__joy	That's excellent , thanks for all your help .
__label__joy	I am sure we will . Actually , we are looking forward to seeing the great wonder .
__label__joy	Thank you . Now I see that you are my true friend . Most of my so-called friends left me at the moment my company went bankrupt . You are the only one who has stood by me the whole time .
__label__anger	I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere !
__label__joy	A cup of coffee , please .
__label__joy	Oh , thank you , just shows you what is going to max jemmy redate for all this body .
__label__joy	Thank you . Have a good one .
__label__joy	Thank you very much !
__label__surprise	Criminals are clever ? They're only successful when people are careless .
__label__joy	Thank you and bye-bye !
__label__joy	Good idea .
__label__anger	Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen .
__label__joy	I ’ m not joking . I got accepted !
__label__joy	Good morning , John !
__label__disgust	On top fo all of that , she didn't seem to have any sense about people's personal space . she didn't keep enough distance between us when during the meeting .
__label__sadness	I ’ m sorry to hear that.You ’ d better stay at home.After all , we can visit Mrs.Brown later
__label__disgust	I don't know . I just know I've never been asked so many questions in my life .
__label__joy	Hey ! I just bought one of those new Japanese cell phones ! It's loaded with extras .
__label__joy	You certainly need that . You always pump the volume up way too high .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__surprise	Really ? When did that happen ?
__label__joy	By the way , a party will be held for new neighbors the day after tomorrow . I hope I can see you there .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Don't mention it . That's what friends are for !
__label__joy	Thanks . I don't suppose you have some paper , too .
__label__joy	Hey , let's go for a spin . You can try it out .
__label__joy	Perhaps you are right . But I still need some time to recover from the failure .
__label__surprise	Gosh , you're right ! It's from some guy named Vic . I wonder who he is ...
__label__joy	I like collecting antiques . It's expensive , but it's a lot of fun .
__label__joy	It definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city .
__label__surprise	No kidding ! Didn't you study for it ?
__label__joy	Me , what brought that on ?
__label__joy	I am very pleased to meet you .
__label__disgust	I dislike it most .
__label__disgust	What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ?
__label__sadness	I'm so sorry about your brother , Mr . Wang .
__label__joy	I'm glad to hear that . Congratulations !
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ?
__label__joy	Thank you for telling me so much , I'll try them next time .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Good ! Julie , if you could pass this plate down to Joe , I think we are all set .
__label__joy	I passed all the tests , Mom .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	When is it ?
__label__joy	That's it !
__label__anger	That ’ s so unfair !
__label__joy	Well , he indeed likes me .
__label__sadness	Sorry , Mum , I'll lock it right away .
__label__joy	Yes . It ’ s a lovely view .
__label__joy	OK .
__label__joy	Smoke is coming out of his car ! He seems to be having engine trouble ! He makes his way into the pit , and Fernando Alonso takes the lead !
__label__joy	Me , too .
__label__joy	That sounds great . I'll bring a bottle of wine .
__label__joy	Good . Tonight 8 o'clock .
__label__joy	Oh , no , surely . Your ideas were very interesting as well .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__anger	Well , there's nothing I can do about my height !
__label__joy	I think it ’ s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . Don ’ t you agree ?
__label__joy	We intend to establish business relationship with your company on the basis of equality and mutual benefit .
__label__joy	It's very nice .
__label__sadness	I had one , but I didn't like the job very much . I wanted to attend graduate school , but I was afraid it would be too tough .
__label__joy	Well , I guess we're all set for another merry Christmas .
__label__fear	I'm afraid you are beginning to look a little overweight . You really need to stop smoking . That's the main reason you're unhealthy .
__label__joy	No problem . We can do it right now .
__label__joy	No , thank you , that'll be all for now .
__label__joy	I see . Thank you .
__label__joy	Tom , we are in the restaurant now !
__label__joy	Got it .
__label__joy	Yes , welcome to our company . I hope we can cooperate happily .
__label__joy	Look ! Mom , that's amazing ! I can't believe the girls have so neat movements .
__label__joy	I ’ Ve seen them before . They ’ re quite incredible . If you want to see historical figures in London , there ’ s one place you have to go .
__label__joy	That's very kind of you to say so . Let's try some after-dinner wines .
__label__surprise	Oh , God . I just forgot it . I should have brought roses for my girlfriend .
__label__joy	Let's hope it is !
__label__sadness	We all know about that , but we have no choice . The chairman of the trade union says he is going to negotiate with the management .
__label__joy	It's beautiful . Enjoy it while it lasts . It's supposed to get cold tomorrow .
__label__joy	I ’ ll look for a ticket for you , too . Thanks !
__label__joy	How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Diane .
__label__disgust	Today , I am busy all day long .
__label__joy	Thank you and good luck .
__label__joy	Good morning , Mary !
__label__surprise	So you don't think you are fat and need to lose weight ?
__label__joy	Indeed . I love the smell of the grass and trees . They certainly refresh my mind .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__surprise	It is incredible .
__label__disgust	Well , it's just that she put a lot of makeup on her face . Actually , natural beauty comes from within .
__label__joy	OK . Thank you .
__label__sadness	It's your turn , sir . I'm sorry that you had to wait . Saturday is a busy day for us .
__label__joy	Sounds good .
__label__surprise	You forgot ? You ...
__label__surprise	Really ! Did she tell you why she didn't show up ?
__label__joy	Yes ! It ’ s very fine meat ! Made it myself ...
__label__anger	Ouch ! The water's too hot !
__label__joy	I see . We have already received many bookings and though I can't guarantee anything , please be assured that we'll try our best , Mr . Davis . I hope you'll understand .
__label__joy	You really do a good job .
__label__joy	Valerie ! Hi ! Wow how have you been ? It ’ s been such a long time !
__label__anger	Damn !
__label__joy	OK .
__label__sadness	I was taking a walk when a young man came at me from nowhere and snatched the bag off my hands and ran away .
__label__joy	Yes , I took off 4 kilos . I am glad you notice it .
__label__joy	What a good idea !
__label__joy	What's that ?
__label__joy	It's fine . What beautiful scenery outside the window ! I think this one will do .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ...
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Of course . It's the best one I have here---and it's only 300 yuan .
__label__joy	Oh , well , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance .
__label__joy	Hey , Rose , how are you feeling ?
__label__joy	Oh , yes , it is . Thank you . I was looking for it just now .
__label__joy	Yeah , I am having a party this saturday night , a sort of house warming , and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
__label__surprise	Really ? What could that be ?
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Nice to meet you too . Let me help you with your bags .
__label__joy	Would you like to go to a concert tonight ?
__label__joy	Bye-bye . Welcome to come next time !
__label__surprise	Really ? How long did you stay there ?
__label__joy	Yes . I've already been to several clubs here .
__label__anger	I haven't even told you what it is yet !
__label__sadness	Well , frankly speaking , I am running a little behind . It's 40 % done .
__label__joy	Yes , so this year we are going to take our first family vacation , just you and I .
__label__joy	I know your feeling . Take it easy and say something to me if you like .
__label__joy	Thanks . Nothing else , today ?
__label__sadness	Well , I'm afraid there is . I have some bad news for you about the results of the forensic tests ... there won't be any results .
__label__joy	Sure , I ’ ll just go put the kettle on . Why don ’ t you have a seat on the sofa and I ’ ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
__label__joy	Does 6 thirty suit you ?
__label__joy	Congratulations on the new apartment .
__label__joy	I was really sad too , but at least I can still listen to their Cds .
__label__joy	Hello sir . Good to meet you , too .
__label__joy	It really doesn't matter at all . I never did like it anyway .
__label__joy	It's a good thing you can speak English !
__label__joy	It's excellent . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
__label__joy	Hi honey ! You ’ ll never guess what ! My friends Julie and Alex are getting married !
__label__surprise	I cannot belive that . It must be cooked up by someone .
__label__joy	Sure . Please take a look at the model of the building . Nice Garden has a total of two blocks which are labeled Block I and Block II . Block I has a total of thirty-eighth floors . The thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth are penthouses . There are four units in one floor . The sizes of the units are one thousand square feet and one thousand and five hundred square feet . The size with one thousand square feet has three bedrooms and the biggest size has four bedrooms .
__label__surprise	haven't you heard ? Brown is the new black .
__label__disgust	It's the fourth one this year . Isn't it horrible .
__label__joy	Sure . You've given a great help to me in the past days .
__label__surprise	Really ? It's very nice of you .
__label__joy	Let me wear you this diamond ring .
__label__surprise	Anything ? Do you really believe that we can do anything ?
__label__joy	Well , in the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulties in getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts .
__label__joy	Sounds good .
__label__joy	I think we are running out of time . The bank is going to close soon .
__label__joy	Nothing . Just wear comfortable clothes and good shoes for walking . We'll bring everything .
__label__joy	Lisa , would you like to go to the library with me ?
__label__joy	That's the very thing I want .
__label__anger	You know you didn't .
__label__joy	Happy new year !
__label__joy	Hi , Lucy !
__label__joy	Of course ! Or are you still too scared !
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__joy	Thanks , John .
__label__joy	No , no , no . I'm just browsing . Thanks anyway .
__label__sadness	Well , I missed several buses .
__label__joy	I had a great time . It ’ ll be good to see them again .
__label__sadness	Oh , it's a pity .
__label__joy	Fine ! Do you want anything to eat now ?
__label__surprise	What ? How happy you life is ! I do envy you .
__label__joy	No doubt .
__label__sadness	B :: I'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me .
__label__joy	Ok , cool .
__label__anger	But what about parking ? You can't park on the street , can you ?
__label__sadness	Me ? Cook our dinners ? Hah ! You will be cooking , dear . You will cook .
__label__joy	Because its trunk is not thick enough to be like a thousand-year-old tree .
__label__joy	I ’ Ve gotta hand it to you , you really did a good job !
__label__joy	Very good , need I help you ?
__label__surprise	I can't believe you wear jeans to the office ! Are you trying to lose your job ?
__label__joy	Yeah , I think so too .
__label__surprise	That's my uncle . You're my cousin ! Hi cousin !
__label__joy	Here's the receipt .
__label__anger	My car won ’ t start ! Stupid old car !
__label__sadness	I had high hopes for NYU .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	I'm fine too , thank you .
__label__surprise	They're glad ? !
__label__joy	Thank you for telling me .
__label__joy	Thanks . Do you think we have enough for the kids to eat and drink ?
__label__joy	That's ok , keep going , you ’ re moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch your dynamics ! Keep your elbows lifted . Remember to stroke the keys , don ’ t pound . That ’ s better ! Remember that as a pianist or any
__label__joy	It's a lovely day , isn't it ?
__label__joy	See you then .
__label__anger	Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops .
__label__joy	My pleasure .
__label__joy	That sounds good . I've missed you my friend .
__label__joy	Oh , OK . Wow !
__label__sadness	It doesn't seem like that . Sorry , sir , we've tried everything , but we're not able to get it off the shirt . It was from the sugar I think .
__label__joy	she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back .
__label__joy	I'll be at your house at about five thirty.Happy birthday .
__label__joy	Terrific !
__label__anger	You won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ’ Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime !
__label__anger	But you should have told me you were in love with her .
__label__joy	I like this fragrance .
__label__joy	Thank you.Thanks to the baker , I benefit a lot from him .
__label__joy	How about going to dance this evening , Jane ? You will find that the night life of this city is very interesting !
__label__joy	Right ! I'll do it straight away .
__label__joy	Can I get you some punch ? I was just going to go get myself some .
__label__joy	Don't mention it .
__label__joy	All right . Let me get you something to drink .
__label__joy	You ’ re the best !

__label__anger	No , you must stay ! I swear it , and the oath shall be kept .
__label__joy	Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower !
__label__joy	This one looks great ! I love the seashore .
__label__joy	Certainly , just a moment , sir .
__label__joy	l love it . There is always something fascinating to discover .
__label__joy	To be honest , I care only about whether I can have some delicious candy eat . I couldn't care less about whether the shop is popular or not .
__label__joy	Thanks , Daisy .
__label__joy	We love it . But we'd like to know about the neighbors .
__label__joy	That's it . She likes dogs so much now , and I begin to love dogs .

__label__sadness	No , Madam . I don't think I do .

__label__joy	I won't argue with that ! Let's go !
__label__joy	A holiday , I hope ! No , really , we are looking into some courses on motivational techniques . We'll add them to the list when we choose a lecturer .
__label__joy	That's good . We eat Chinese food only at the Chinese restaurant .

__label__disgust	I wish I hadn't chosen this job .
__label__joy	Thank you . Ah ! But this is in French . Would you mind giving me the English menu ?
__label__joy	Yeah , that would let us know what would work best .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , sir . This is not a full service gas station . I will help you fill the gas , but we don't wash windows here .
__label__disgust	I wasn't happy with it .
__label__joy	Good idea . That will help us to warm up .
__label__joy	No , I'm strictly a spectator . I just like watching skating . It's so beautiful .
__label__joy	Umm . . . That's the spirit !
__label__surprise	The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water . Compared to the oceans , most countries are tiny .
__label__surprise	Really ? That's a straws in the wind .
__label__joy	Sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ?
__label__joy	You have a very good taste . It's our best seller .
__label__joy	OK . I'll take it .
__label__sadness	Sure.Hey , I'm sorry , but I've got to get going .
__label__joy	Not bad .
__label__joy	I may take you there some day .
__label__joy	So do I . You are a beautiful flower in my mind .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Ahh ... What a fine day ! I do feel like an outdoor exercise .

__label__joy	Yes , of course . I can't go through a day without coffee in the morning .
__label__surprise	50 dollars . That's too much .
__label__joy	Not bad . Everything goes well .
__label__surprise	What ? Why ? I mean ... just like that ? I ’ m fired ?
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__joy	No problem . In the meantime , don't try to worry so much . You'll get through this .
__label__joy	Yes , sir . We are looking forward to your coming .
__label__joy	It looks really artistic ! How did you learn to do that ?
__label__joy	It's no problem at all .
__label__joy	What a lovely dog ! How did you know I love this ?
__label__surprise	Really ? That's fantastic ! Will you get a chance to do any writing ?
__label__surprise	Me too .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	ok , I ’ ll do that . Thank you , Iris .
__label__surprise	My Goodness ! What a busy line so early in the morning ! Hello .
__label__joy	OK , I'll take it . Here's the money .
__label__surprise	Good ? Yes , it's good for her but not for me . You see , she tells me that I'll feel better about myself if I slim down . She keeps giving me newspaper clippings about the latest miracle diet and insists that I join a health club , as she has .
__label__joy	Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go .
__label__joy	Yeah . Anytime .
__label__joy	Sure . We hope your wish will come true .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot for calling us . Could you tell me more about what you need us to do ?
__label__joy	You can read the newspaper . Maybe it will tell you whether it will snow or not .
__label__joy	A little bit expensive , but I will buy one . This is $ 25 , here you are .
__label__joy	That sounds fair .
__label__joy	No sweat ! Think nothing of it .
__label__joy	I see . Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	OK . Do you want us to bring something ?
__label__joy	It is tough to accept it , I mean . But can you tell me why ?
__label__sadness	But she did and made me disappointed .
__label__joy	Something like listening to music is a good idea .
__label__joy	I'll enjoy working with you . Have a great day !
__label__joy	Good idea !
__label__joy	I see . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	I went to the beach with my friends and had a barbecue there .
__label__joy	I'm an engineer , I work for Boeing . Say , would you like a drink ?
__label__surprise	Crazy !
__label__joy	Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ?
__label__joy	We drove to the lake and had a picnic . We had a great time ! How about you ? Did you do anything special ?
__label__joy	Thank you , Dad .
__label__joy	Cool ! We can watch Ally Mcneal !
__label__anger	Why am I being arrested ?
__label__joy	Just make yourself at home .
__label__joy	Okay , I'll have everything prepared for you when you get here .
__label__anger	That's not nice .
__label__joy	Thank you so much .
__label__anger	No , thank you .
__label__sadness	Sorry , Mum , I'll lock it right away .
__label__anger	How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ?
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__sadness	I apologize , and I'll make sure he doesn't do that again .
__label__joy	Goodbye , and have a nice day .
__label__joy	Yes ! I agree ! We could really use another one ! I ’ ll get on that right away ! What else would you like to order ?
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
__label__joy	I ’ ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . I ’ ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! Gardening all done !
__label__joy	Superb ! It's a 4 megapixel one and the photos it takes are very vivid and clear .
__label__anger	What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ’ m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ’ absurd !
__label__joy	How do you like your new boss ?
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	It looks good on you .
__label__joy	Good idea . How about a cup of coffee ?
__label__joy	OK , let me make a wish ... Do you want a big piece of cake ?
__label__sadness	A really dreadful accident and many people were killed .
__label__anger	Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?
__label__joy	Isn't it wonderful walking here ?
__label__surprise	Are you sure ? Then I'd love more beer please
__label__joy	Sure does . Hey , can I sponge a little cash of you ?
__label__sadness	I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock .
__label__joy	Keep in touch !
__label__joy	No problem . Follow me , please .
__label__joy	Why , that's very kind of you , Mrs . Johnson . I'm sure my wife will be glad to .
__label__joy	That sounds pretty good ! How much is it ?
__label__joy	Very good . Is there anything else you would like ?
__label__joy	I really enjoyed our evening together , Todd .
__label__joy	Yes , therefore they are expanding the scope of their service . For example , hotels can be booked through the same site as well .
__label__joy	Let's take a walk for a half an hour . My sister will get here at about 8: 30PM and then we can all go out to dinner .
__label__joy	Thank you , sir . We will phone you as soon as we have a vacant table .
__label__sadness	I'd love to , but I'm afraid I can't .
__label__joy	Me too , but I think we shouldn't drink too much of it , as it's not very healthy .
__label__joy	It's very nice , I like it very much .
__label__joy	Should we tip ? This service is pretty good .
__label__surprise	I'm so surprised , B . Why did you decide to end your marriage suddenly ?
__label__joy	Well , thank you .
__label__joy	It deserves . That film can give us a lot of inspiration .
__label__joy	Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ’ s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous .
__label__joy	Super . How long will I have to sit under the Hot Cap ?
__label__sadness	Maybe . But it still gets on my nerves .
__label__joy	I am glad you like it .
__label__joy	Hey , David . Where did you get the sofa ? It's so beautiful . Look at the color , I really love this yellow , so bright ! It must be very expensive .
__label__joy	Thanks . I really appreciate it .
__label__joy	That's okay . A 15 - inch is good enough . All right , I'll take it .
__label__joy	Let me look at the calendar . Good ! The twenty-fourth is a Saturday . Is he coming alone ?
__label__joy	I can solve it , thanks .
__label__joy	How time flies ! We have been lovers for nearly a year . We hit it off instantly .
__label__joy	That's great . What's on tonight ?
__label__joy	Oh , look ! There's a spot open next to the public restroom ! Can I take it ?
__label__joy	I went a global warming rally in London . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
__label__anger	I just don't trust you any more .
__label__joy	Have fun .
__label__fear	But she took her luggage away with her .
__label__joy	You are always responsible and careful .
__label__joy	Here you are . Keep the change .
__label__disgust	Get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work . What a life ! I've had enough of it .
__label__joy	Well , if you insist , you are welcome to bring a potato salad !
__label__joy	It was great meeting you .
__label__joy	Please help yourself to whatever you like , don't be shy .
__label__joy	Bye .
__label__joy	Sure , I see safety is most important thing ! Accident is awful ! I will take your advice !
__label__joy	That's what I do .
__label__anger	Getting worse . Now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . I ’ Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw .
__label__joy	Good that way . I can have the suit ready for you two days after that fitting .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	Well , we can't break tradition ! It's bad luck !
__label__joy	Well , I think you look nice today too .
__label__surprise	Ten days ? Would you please repeat it again ?
__label__joy	I really like your books . I ’ Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again !
__label__joy	Well , have a great time !
__label__joy	No problem . How would you like to pay for these ?
__label__surprise	My God ! You really bought a lot . Why do you need so much ?
__label__joy	I enjoyed talking to you .
__label__joy	Mary , it's good to see you !
__label__joy	Me too . I love to play on the swing as well . Swing is my favorite .
__label__surprise	Really ? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . What did you think of it ?
__label__joy	Fine , thanks . I ’ m having several friends over for dinner this Saturday . And I was wondering if you have the time to join us .
__label__joy	Yes darling . You are quite right .
__label__joy	Sure ! How about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches ?
__label__joy	Happy Thanksgiving !
__label__disgust	Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The two just don ’ t go together .
__label__joy	Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ’ m sorry I missed it .
__label__joy	You made a good choice .
__label__joy	Sure . Just leave it to me . I'll finish it .
__label__surprise	Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea .
__label__joy	Can I get you another blanket ?
__label__joy	Almost . I have to get dressed . It's a formal party and I have special party make up !
__label__joy	Enjoy your drink , sir .
__label__sadness	Frank has gone out with Lucy again .
__label__joy	I will . Thanks for your advice .
__label__joy	They have lollypops , chocolate drops , fruit candy , mints , pearbrittles and toffee . They are in different colors and flavors .
__label__joy	Thanks so much .
__label__joy	Nice to meet you , too .
__label__joy	It must be a unique experience . I ’ m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
__label__joy	Mine too .
__label__joy	Wait for a moment , I'll come back soon .
__label__sadness	Well , it's too bad that we like different kinds of movies . Maybe we're just different kinds of people .
__label__joy	Great ! Pick me up in about an hour because I think I ’ ll also get a bean bag and a dining set .
__label__joy	Wonderful ! I'll often come here for mountain climbing .
__label__joy	Thanks . That ’ s terrific !
__label__surprise	No kidding ?
__label__sadness	It started yesterday . I didn't eat any supper .
__label__joy	It was a round day for me . My family attend the graduation ceremony . I was so nervous . I couldn't find my cap and gown , but all worked out in the end .
__label__joy	That's easy . Anything else ?
__label__joy	I appreciate your understanding .
__label__joy	I can lend you some money .
__label__joy	Oh , maybe I can take the bus or even rent a car .
__label__joy	Great ! Can you set the table ?
__label__joy	It's nice of you to see me off .
__label__joy	Oh , that sounds great !
__label__joy	Thanks very much .
__label__sadness	Well , sir , I think I have made a mistake . I will take it back to the kitchen right now .
__label__joy	Titanic is playing tonight . It's a blockbuster .
__label__joy	Cool . Your guitar skills are very impressive . How did you learn to play like that ?
__label__joy	See you later .
__label__joy	Yes . To be frank , I really love him to death .
__label__joy	I like to read Fortune .
__label__joy	She is tired , but getting a lot of rest now .
__label__joy	You know , I saw that and it looks pretty good !
__label__joy	It's a pleasure to meet you . My name is Lucy .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry . That's the only available time .
__label__joy	Have a great time tomorrow night .
__label__joy	It ’ s a great car . It ’ s very comfortable and it goes really fast .
__label__sadness	Well . I think I'm going to fail my chemistry exam .
__label__joy	I realize that I ’ m not in a position to offer you the kind of promotion you deserve I'll gladly do what I can to help .
__label__joy	Sure . Here is your receipt and you can draw your tax paid for those goods at customs .
__label__joy	Yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which is open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry .
__label__joy	Certainly .
__label__joy	Hi , Steven , welcome to join us !
__label__joy	Since the early 1960 ' s , there are horror movies about people who encounter frightening , unnatural situations , and serious films such as documentarist about events that actually happened , and science fiction movies about possible friture and future worlds . Some people have also enjoyed watching psycho-dramas about the everyday problems that people have .
__label__joy	Jim , how was your weekend ?
__label__anger	Oh , what a terrible situation ! This traffic is unbearable .
__label__joy	Fine ! How are you ?
__label__joy	Would you like to have lunch with me ?
__label__joy	Ha , ha , ha ! I agree . That ’ s not much fun .
__label__fear	That was really a nightmare !
__label__joy	It ’ s a pleasant dream , but everything depends on if !
__label__joy	You look pale recently .
__label__sadness	The supply outstrips the demand in the job market and women are in a disadvantageous position as a whole .
__label__joy	It's very good . How do you make it ?
__label__disgust	I didn't really like it .
__label__joy	Sounds better , but I hope it doesn't inspire me to take a hammer to the client's head .
__label__joy	You are so kind , you helped me a lot .
__label__surprise	Really ? That's great . You hope to join a company after graduating ?
__label__joy	Yeah , I hope so . Well , take it easy .
__label__surprise	No ! He hit me first .
__label__joy	What an amazing goal !
__label__joy	No problem . Thank you for calling me .
__label__joy	I don't really . I just like wildlife , and you don't get to see too much of it in the city . This place is full of it .
__label__joy	Thanks , but I want to have a look at the Motorola's products .
__label__joy	OK , thank you very much .
__label__joy	No wonder your English is so good .
__label__joy	How about the new bar across road ?
__label__joy	Okay . Thanks .
__label__joy	Yeah , they can enjoy themselves in the day time and it is not so hot .
__label__joy	No , thanks . I already drove by to see what the neighborhood looks like .
__label__joy	Well , it looks very nice .
__label__joy	Hello , Jack.Happy birthday !
__label__joy	I am really proud of you .
__label__anger	Listen to some music ? And who ’ ll cook dinner ? Will you ?
__label__disgust	No , cats are too dirty . They are lazy and cunning . I don ’ t like them at all .
__label__joy	Of course ! It's the most wonderful natural works .
__label__joy	You are welcome .
__label__joy	that's amazing ! Has she bitten you yet ?
__label__joy	That is awesome . Congratulations ! I know you can make it .
__label__surprise	Pot ? Isn't that marijuana ?
__label__joy	May I invite you for the first dance ?
__label__joy	That ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier .
__label__joy	Good morning , Ms.Wilson . I've got a lot to learn from you . I think I'll enjoy working with you .
__label__joy	It sounds so moving .
__label__disgust	Awful . It was a complete waste of time .
__label__joy	If it were up to Stanley , we'd have the wedding in the ETV ! He loves to sing .
__label__joy	Wow , you really do have a talent for this , Alice . Thanks for the suggestions .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__joy	Thanks for the information . And good luck in your college search .
__label__joy	I'm having a great time . I love it . I'm glad we came .
__label__surprise	Your knowledge of English is really surprising .
__label__joy	I hope that we can continue our cooperation .
__label__joy	It's my pleasure .
__label__joy	Yes , I am . You must be Tom . Nice to meet you .
__label__joy	Thanks for your help .
__label__sadness	I can ’ t believe it . I guess I ’ ll be here until 10 again tonight .
__label__joy	That's an interesting combination . How about western movies ?
__label__joy	I would really like to bring my friend Jake , if that would be OK .
__label__joy	Good for you , keep it up .
__label__joy	Ah , got it . Ideal Life School , programs
__label__joy	Many congratulations on your winning the game .
__label__joy	Thanks for sharing your experience with me .
__label__joy	Sure . Why don ’ t you try it on ? The fitting room is over there .
__label__joy	Have a nice day , Ma ’ am .
__label__joy	It ’ s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
__label__surprise	Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ?
__label__joy	Saturday is perfect . What time would you like ?
__label__joy	( After they enter the park ) Oh , it's so quiet here.We have the park to ourselves , only you and me !
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__joy	Yes .
__label__joy	Great , then we can add everything up and take it to the bank .
__label__surprise	you ’ re kidding ! How did that happen ?
__label__joy	Thank you.You ' re so considerate .
__label__joy	That's great . Can I book the room ?
__label__joy	We got the contract !
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , this is our rock bottom price .
__label__anger	I tell you I must go !
__label__joy	Wonderful . I'm eager to take a sauna as soon as possible .
__label__joy	There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect .
__label__joy	Fine , thanks a lot . Bye !
__label__joy	Yes , that's fine . I'll take it . Can I pay by check ?
__label__joy	I like the pier too , because it's beautiful at night .
__label__joy	How about some coffee or tea then ?
__label__joy	I am glad to inform you that you are expected to come for an interview in our head office tomorrow .
__label__joy	All this is thanks to the efforts of my superiors and colleagues .
__label__anger	I shouted it back of course .
__label__joy	I ’ m happy that we ’ Ve come to an agreement .
__label__joy	Don't mention it .
__label__anger	I ’ m sure this one is especially bad . And the word is so unpleasant .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot . My wife and I will be welcoming and looking forward to your visit .
__label__joy	Here is your receipt . Thank you .
__label__joy	Here you are.It ' s very attractive .
__label__joy	You look great , you are absolutely glowing .
__label__sadness	Yeah it's too bad ... but actually I think I know what to do .
__label__joy	Wonderfull.Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Oh , wow , that's cool . Um , why do people keep pets ?
__label__joy	That sounds good . I ’ ll call you once I arrive .
__label__joy	Of course not ! We built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . We went sliding on the nice hill . It was a real work out . At noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . Fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . You must come with us next time . I bet you will love it .
__label__fear	No , I'm scared of cats .

__label__joy	Oh , any chance of a table by the window ? My wife loves the bird's eye view . As it's her birthday , I want it to be a celebration .
__label__joy	That sounds great . But how do you know that's a crush or a real love ?
__label__joy	Good luck . I'm sure you will do a good job .
__label__joy	It was so kind of you .
__label__joy	It's on 7th Street .
__label__surprise	Yeah , how do you know about that ?
__label__surprise	I can ’ t believe it !

__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	Sure . First we'll go buy a newspaper and then we'll go to the library .
__label__joy	Say , how would you like to be a dress designer ?
__label__joy	Oh , it's made of wool . I like the striped pattern .

__label__surprise	Are you kidding ? I really don't think that you think less clearly on non-vegetarian diet .
__label__joy	We have great confidence in you .
__label__anger	You did a horrible job on my hair .
__label__joy	They offer clearer and sharper images . Many of them also have up to 20x optical zoom lenses , a photo mode and fast-action mode .

__label__joy	For me ? The football games of course , I love football games .
__label__joy	It's my new pendant . Do you like it ?
__label__joy	Thank you . You are cooking up a storm .
__label__joy	I'm sure your wife will love them .
__label__joy	I used to be like that . But I go skiing so often that I don't get excited anymore .
__label__joy	That's perfect . Let me have her .
__label__joy	Pretty well . I don't know if I'll get the promotion or not , but I feel good about it .
__label__sadness	I ’ Ve got some bad news . All the plans sent over to the McGrath Corporation have been rejected . We ’ re going to have to start from scratch .
__label__sadness	Let me see ... Sorry , sir . We are fully booked tonight . Would you mind making a reservation some other time ?

__label__joy	A new candy shop just opened around the corner last week . They have a variety of candies and it is always full of people .
__label__surprise	Oh , what a pleasant surprise ! Don't you remember me ?
__label__joy	That looks good . The room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom , so you wouldn ’ t be able to put all the furniture in your room .
__label__joy	That would be wonderful . Thank you so much for all of your help .
__label__joy	Josh and I were just on our way back home from the beach and thought we'd drop by .

__label__joy	Hey , how would you like to taste my fist ?
__label__joy	Ahh ! Now that's more like it . Atmosphere !
__label__disgust	Yup , that ’ s him . He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless .
__label__joy	You made a perfect choice , Jack .
__label__joy	I really feel grateful to you for your reference . They have mentioned this in the job interview .
__label__joy	Congratulations ! What's your normal handicap ?

__label__joy	It ’ s great ! I ’ Ve learned a lot from reading it .
__label__joy	And how ’ s everyone in your family ?
__label__joy	Not at all . She's a joy to have in my class .
__label__joy	No problem ! We have a broad selection of suits , all tailored made so that it will fit perfectly .
__label__joy	Follow me to the back-yard .
__label__joy	Then you must be interested in disco dancing , aren't you ?

__label__joy	Sure , I'd love to . I heard Sichuan cuisine is very hot , I think I definitely love it .

__label__joy	Would you like to go to the theater with me tomorrow ?
__label__surprise	Really ? It is a weekly , isn't it ?

__label__joy	It's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun .
__label__joy	Delighted I was able to help .
__label__joy	Certainly ! The most attractive place is that , it's very large ; it is 8 times the size of Forbidden City and 16 times the size of Summer Palace . The art of gardens is perfectly represented in it .
__label__joy	You were lucky then . What did you do after that ?
__label__joy	But I am told that you dance wonderfully well .
__label__joy	I am calling to thank you for giving me the interview for the Sales Manager position yesterday .

__label__surprise	oh , I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play .
__label__anger	Oh , my God . It's disaster . It makes my head look like a soccer ball .
__label__joy	I'm happy to be of assistance .

__label__joy	Waltz is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances .
__label__joy	ok . Have a good day . Here's your passport and documents back .
__label__joy	I'm moblogging !
__label__joy	How in the world ! Who came up with seats like that from your company ?
__label__joy	That sounds interesting . Have you been involved in any mystery ?
__label__joy	Got it .
__label__sadness	Because I feel tired all the time , even when I wake up in the morning . I find it very difficult to do any work . I have no appetite .

__label__joy	The players are scrambling to get the ball . Vargas gets to first base and he ’ s still going ! The outfielder throws it to second ! Vargas slides ! He ’ s safe !
__label__surprise	How could you cheat on your wife ? You have been married for ten years .
__label__sadness	Oh , gosh ! I feel everything around me is against me .
__label__joy	Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though .
__label__sadness	I came back to my room and found my suitcase was open and my camera and five hundred dollars in cash inside the wallet were gone .
__label__joy	Well , it looks very nice .
__label__joy	Here you are . Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	I can't agree more .
__label__joy	Nope ! It's the latest generation of PAD ! You won't believe what it can do .
__label__joy	Yes , I'm looking forward to meeting everybody and getting started on my new job .
__label__surprise	You forgot ? You ...
__label__joy	Of course . Everything's so striking and fascinating .
__label__sadness	Well . It ’ s not all my fault , Anna ...
__label__joy	It's a lot of money . But the picture is excellent , I'll take it .
__label__joy	That's great ! Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Totally . I am saying it from the bottom of my heart ! And it's obvious that he ’ s head over heels in love with you , too .
__label__surprise	I hate working on Christmas Eve ! Whoa ! Get a load of this guy ! Come in central , I think we ’ Ve got ourselves a situation here .
__label__joy	Great ! That's settled then .
__label__sadness	It's leap my mind . I really feel terrible about it .
__label__joy	Do you feel like a king in your castle ?
__label__sadness	That doesn ’ t make any sense .
__label__joy	I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . We just made a record sale this season .
__label__joy	Thanks . That'll be OK .
__label__joy	Look , I am playing the piano for you .
__label__joy	That makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ?
__label__joy	Great ! Would you like your second pizza to be these as the first ?
__label__joy	You can find anything ! Are you sure you want to start shopping online though ? Once you step into this world , there is no turning back !
__label__joy	I know the perfect place !
__label__surprise	Hawaii ? My dream honeymoon destination ?
__label__joy	Yes , people surely can . He's whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though .
__label__joy	I think the Olympics help to promote world peace .
__label__surprise	A gold watch !
__label__joy	But it's really exciting .
__label__surprise	You did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America .
__label__surprise	really ? Is that why you wanted to come to the play ?
__label__joy	We could find a classical one .
__label__joy	Oh ! You're engaged ! What a beautiful engagement ring ! Who to ?
__label__joy	Thanks . I will wait you at my home .
__label__joy	That's fantastic . I think I like this one .
__label__joy	Yes . Dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart . They are also the fastest swimmers in the world .
__label__joy	Xu spikes it ! Wow , what a great hit ! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in ! Great play .
__label__joy	Don't worry about it , Lin.That ' s no big deal.You know , Americans appreciate China's rich culinary culture . Just excuse me for a second while I check the number here and figure out how much to give the waiter.Hmm , by the way , what do you do about tipping in China ?
__label__joy	How lovely ! How much is she ?
__label__joy	Not bad . There ’ s a new English teacher .
__label__joy	How much do I owe you ?
__label__joy	Yes , that's a good idea .
__label__joy	Yes , with pleasure .
__label__joy	Did she ? That ’ s great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment .
__label__joy	Great . Bye .
__label__joy	That's great ! When will we go ?
__label__joy	Thanks a lot . That's the favor I was going to ask you for .
__label__joy	Hello , everybody . I am Monica and this is my first day at work . I am working in the finance department . I am very happy to meet everyone and I am looking forward to working well with all of you . I am very happy to be one of the team and I will do my best to get into the working situation as soon as possible . By the way , call me Monica . Everybody calls me so .
__label__surprise	That's a notebook ?
__label__sadness	It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer .
__label__joy	Please bring me a cup of coffee .
__label__joy	It's very nice , I like it very much .
__label__joy	do you prefer brandy or ports .
__label__surprise	500 feet ! I would never be able to do that .
__label__joy	Actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . I made far too much food to eat alone . I am glad you could come over to help me finish it .
__label__joy	I'm so glad for your help .
__label__joy	Yes , of course . But I only freelance on weekends with my uncle .
__label__joy	How do you know ?
__label__anger	You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
__label__joy	Thank you . If you have any problems , just call .
__label__joy	When you miss a day of school , I'll be happy to give you the English assignments .
__label__joy	on the fouth day , we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic ! And no stomach problems .
__label__anger	And you're going to dust every piece of furniture in the house !
__label__sadness	I just remembered that I've got to give a speech in class today and I forgot to prepare for it .
__label__sadness	I feel the same way .
__label__joy	Thank you for inviting me .
__label__sadness	I'd been feeling pretty well until just a few days ago .
__label__joy	That would be perfect . That way , someone will be there , but you will have them right away .
__label__joy	We're happy together now .
__label__joy	I can't . I have to meet someone .
__label__sadness	Well , actually I failed to meet a deadline last week and I forgot to answer an e-mail for a VIP customer yesterday .
__label__sadness	I ’ d better go tomorrow .
__label__joy	You're my hero .
__label__joy	great . I ’ m looking forward to it .
__label__surprise	Dude , what are you talking about ? Only girls do that .
__label__joy	Thanks for the warning ! See you tomorrow !
__label__joy	Thank you . I appreciate the compliment .
__label__joy	Can you make my hair short ?
__label__joy	OK , I ’ ll try later . Thanks anyway .
__label__joy	That will be fine .
__label__joy	You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help .
__label__sadness	I ’ m sorry that you didn ’ t get in .
__label__joy	the end of all the hard work for my master's . what a nice feeling to get my degree !
__label__joy	you're dancing so well .
__label__disgust	Because they are too violent . Some of them are even disgusting .
__label__disgust	Maybe it is . But it ’ s out of fashion .
__label__joy	That is a wonderful idea .
__label__joy	A little , but the rush was worth it .
__label__joy	what other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ?
__label__joy	Thank you . How much is it ?
__label__joy	Wait a second ! There's the idea for this case ! “ Your motor oil should be as choice and fresh as your morning coffee . ”
__label__joy	Any time . I'm just glad I could help .
__label__joy	Well ... the beer sounds good !
__label__joy	Hello ! What are you reading about in the newspaper ?
__label__sadness	I can't work out this problem .
__label__joy	O . K . Mr . Smith . Thanks for calling .
__label__joy	I will . Don't worry !
__label__anger	I am sorry to say it's not on the way , but during loading . The tins inside the cases were broken evidently through rough handling .
__label__anger	I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you !
__label__joy	Thanks . I'll pay you back on Friday .
__label__joy	My wife wants to take the children to go shopping , where is the best place to go ?
__label__joy	There . It looks great , don ’ t you think ? I ’ m going to get these jeans as well . I need a new pair . I need a new pair . I ‘ m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter .
__label__joy	Well , if he can become president , then I can at least get a promotion .
__label__joy	Thank you . Welcome to call again . Goodbye .
__label__disgust	That ’ s horrible .
__label__joy	Sure .
__label__joy	Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can dance it very well . Let's dance it now .
__label__surprise	That's too much !
__label__joy	I love it . I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it.It gives me a real sense of satisfaction.Do you enjoy cooking ?
__label__surprise	Really ? How many do you have ?
__label__joy	It suits us fine . We ’ ll see you then .
__label__joy	Lulu . Lulu . Say hello . hello . Oh , she is so smart . Good bird .
__label__sadness	No , I Don't . Either I shape up or my job is on the line .
__label__joy	I trust you ’ re keeping well ?
__label__joy	Just call me Miao Dou , Please .
__label__surprise	What do you mean ? I bought this computer just three years ago !
__label__joy	That sounds like fun.Would you mind some company ?
__label__joy	Thanks . Try not to work too hard while I ’ m away !
__label__joy	Yeah , time for more coffee !
__label__disgust	I'm getting sick of work man . I can't take the political bull in the company any more .
__label__fear	I was stuck between 15th and 16th floors in the elevator .
__label__anger	This room is unfit for humans . I want another room , and I want a refund for tonight .
__label__joy	Fine , thank you .
__label__joy	I know . I'm a little nervous , but it's pretty exciting .
__label__joy	You're welcome . I hope you'll be more comfortable in your new room .
__label__joy	Thanks . I think you look nice today , too .
__label__joy	no problem . Did you bring any gifts back for your department ?
__label__anger	That works for me !
__label__anger	Oh sure , lady , and fat chance I'd get a ticket before they're sold out . I'm staying right here , understand ? So be a nice lady and butt out !
__label__sadness	Yeah . It ’ s pretty bad , that car looks like a coke can .
__label__anger	Just get out of my face !
__label__joy	Sure ! I just got back yesterday . I'm still suffering from jet lag .
__label__joy	Very well , thank you .
__label__joy	Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line .
__label__anger	It ’ s an absolute outrage , Sarah , the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers ’ money to the auto industry . These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt .
__label__joy	I really like your books . I ’ Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again !
__label__joy	These are beautiful ! Is this the marvelous landscape in Guiling ?
__label__joy	Wow , that sounds great .
__label__joy	They're both very well , thanks .
__label__joy	I really appreciated it .
__label__joy	Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later .
__label__joy	It's very nice of you .
__label__joy	I really have a good time here.Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Why don't you come round for a meal one evening next week ?
__label__joy	I think you ’ re absolutely right . Ok , that ’ s decided then !
__label__anger	Try to be more careful in future . Look ! You ’ Ve damaged the sign .
__label__joy	There are times of games planned , should have a grand time .
__label__joy	Here it is , and here we are .
__label__surprise	Are you serious ?
__label__joy	I'm so excited ! We have two weeks off ! What are you going to do ?
__label__joy	You can say that again .
__label__joy	Linda , I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed our time together last Friday night .
__label__joy	Fine , what do you call this ?
__label__joy	It's good . It's a nice room .
__label__joy	That's good . It's most thoughtful of you to do this , Miss Wood .
__label__joy	This broth is wonderful . What's in it ?
__label__joy	Thank you . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Thanks . I feel like celebrating . Let's go have a beer . It's on me .
__label__disgust	... What a stink . This place stinks like rotten eggs .
__label__anger	Isn't that a bit excessive ?
__label__surprise	Are you joking ? What am I going to do with you ? We are going to a dinner party not the beach ! Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and these corduroy pants . It ’ s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
__label__joy	Yeah . Thanks . And have fun !
__label__joy	Great , here are some flowers for you . I hope you like them . I was not sure if the color will suit your new apartment .
__label__joy	I'm very well , thank you.How are you ?
__label__anger	You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
__label__surprise	How come you don ’ t know where it is ?
__label__fear	I'm afraid of the darkness .
__label__sadness	Oh , I ’ m sorry . It completely slipped my mind .
__label__joy	Well , thank you , Mr . Smith . But I was just doing my job .
__label__joy	By all means . (= Of course . )
__label__joy	Oh , that's great ! Thank you .
__label__joy	What a beautiful home !
__label__joy	I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy .
__label__joy	Oh , dear , I'm so happy .
__label__sadness	Well , not in so many words . But I know that productivity is a big issue for him . Oh , he said the usual things like “ Keep up the good work ” and “ Thanks for your hard work , ” but he also said that he's thinking about bringing some employees into my department . That , to me , means he's not satisfied with what I've been doing .
__label__surprise	Look ! Who is that guy on the stage ?
__label__anger	There are nine cockroaches in my room . I don't have time for your disbelief !
__label__joy	Have a pleasant stay .
__label__sadness	What's so terrible too , is the fools we've made of ourselves .
__label__joy	Goodbye .
__label__joy	Certainly .
__label__joy	At least one for your trip .
__label__joy	That's a cool idea . At least it would be a surprise.But I'm afraid he wouldn't take care of it .
__label__joy	All right , sir . May I have your driver's license ?
__label__joy	Right . I enjoy what I'm doing .
__label__joy	And the host announced that he won it all !
__label__joy	See you tonight then .
__label__anger	Every day I have less money ! I haven't spent anything , it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate .
__label__joy	Why not ! These orders are not urgent . We could do it first thing tomorrow morning
__label__joy	That ’ s fabulous . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	How nice .
__label__joy	Thanks . I'll put it in a safe place .
__label__joy	That's much more convenient . We don't even have to bring the flavorings .
__label__surprise	Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ?
__label__joy	Sounds good .
__label__joy	Enough ! I can't wait anymore .
__label__anger	I'm not at all convinced . Tomorrow is Saturday !
__label__surprise	Pardon ?
__label__joy	I see . Thanks for your drive .
__label__joy	They're quite popular now . Wasn't her voice good ?
__label__joy	Oh , I learned that he is also a legendary violinist .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	... Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling , and an endangered species too . This is lucky .
__label__joy	Yes , very . I thought the last speaker was especially good .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot . Have a nice day .
__label__joy	What about some drink ?
__label__surprise	That can ’ t be right !
__label__joy	Nice to meet you , I'am Simon . I don't think I ' Ve seen you around before .
__label__joy	Well , thanks very much .
__label__surprise	Really ? Who will play ?
__label__joy	Thank you !
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__joy	According to the story , it's some sort of modern dance style .
__label__joy	I know a very interesting place .
__label__anger	When I was your age , my parents didn ’ t have central heating like you do ! We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it . We used it to cook , heat the house and even dry our clothes ! We never caught a cold . You should be grateful !
__label__anger	Shut up !
__label__joy	I'd like to . See you then .
__label__joy	Did you have time to go to the zoo ?
__label__joy	Yes , follow me . Here it is .
__label__surprise	Wow ! I'm impressed !
__label__joy	I really appreciate it . Thank you .
__label__joy	Great . See you then .
__label__anger	Not back home for dinner again ? That ’ s the third time this week !
__label__joy	Talking about a barbecue , didn't you say you are organizing one next week ?
__label__joy	Now that's a plus !
__label__joy	Tomorrow , I ’ ll cut the grass . Then the garden will lock perfect .
__label__joy	Thank you . I am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . You know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome .
__label__joy	So will I . Thank you .
__label__joy	Yes . It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth it . It gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people .
__label__joy	Thank you , shall I open it now ?
__label__joy	Okay , thanks a lot .
__label__fear	Is it gonna hurt ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	That's a good idea . Let's go over the weekend .
__label__joy	I love flowers , you know . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Oh , no problem . Here's the lid that comes with the pan .
__label__joy	I ’ m so surprised to meet you in this remote village . Long time no see .
__label__joy	En , it's so beautiful that I don't want to move my eyes from it .
__label__surprise	That's crazy .
__label__joy	You won't be disappointed .
__label__joy	Great . Talk to you then .
__label__joy	Is that you , Dave ? Oh , my gosh ! The backstabber who left us to work for the evil WebTracker !
__label__joy	I have to study for an exam too . Why don't we study together . We can encourage each other .
__label__joy	Well have a good time . Get me some autographs if you can .
__label__joy	Thanks . Who do I call for trash collection ?
__label__disgust	I hate the hero.He ' s too cruel .
__label__joy	I agree with you .
__label__joy	No , I just read the names off the packages ... Ha !
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Look ! You can see the village way down in the valley .
__label__joy	Sure . But the work you did was really exceptional ! You definitely deserved it !
__label__joy	Nice to meet you , Dolma .
__label__surprise	You ’ re not sure ? You were going at 90 miles per hour ! That ’ s 25 mph over the legal speed limit ! Have you been drinking ?
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome .
__label__joy	You owe me $ 55 .
__label__joy	I will . Thank you , dad .
__label__joy	I am going to invite other guys . See you that day .
__label__sadness	I'm afraid I can't go to the pictures with you tomorrow .
__label__joy	That's all right . Have a good day .
__label__joy	Yeah . How are you these days ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much . Please fill out this paperwork .
__label__joy	Good morning ! Welcome to our office !
__label__joy	No , thank you .
__label__joy	That's an excellent idea .
__label__joy	Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner .
__label__surprise	Why ? I work very hard .
__label__joy	Ha ha . I know what you mean . But it's just a movie . They need for the characters to do that .
__label__surprise	Wow , they were good . I guess criminals aren't that dumb after all .
__label__surprise	There are no countries marked on the map .
__label__joy	Then let me take you out to dinner to celebrate .
__label__sadness	It's really there ? This all seems so surreal-like it's all one big nightmare .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	The tea smells good . What tea is it ?
__label__joy	it's nice , but it's rather plain . Do you want to try my tiramisu ?
__label__joy	No problem . See you this afternoon .
__label__sadness	It was around 1 thirty in the morning . I guess I didn ’ t fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind . I just couldn ’ t stop thinking about them .
__label__joy	The garden looks lovely when the roses are in bloom . You must have a lot of pleasure in planting flowers .
__label__surprise	What ! How am I supposed to get to school or go shopping ? This is not happening !
__label__joy	I couldn ’ t have been any happier !
__label__anger	Why should I do that ? I'm good at my job ! That's the only important thing !
__label__joy	How do you do ? I ’ m pleased to meet you .
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome .
__label__joy	That's the beauty of it , and the danger .
__label__joy	You did a good job . But I got tired of working in the garden .
__label__joy	With pleasure , chap . But before I start , I need to know what you want a bike for ?
__label__joy	Oh , thank you . That's very nice of you .
__label__joy	That's very kind of you . Thank you .
__label__joy	Of course !
__label__joy	You look really beautiful in it .
__label__sadness	Not from this brand , I'm afraid .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__surprise	Oh , no . I ’ m leaving for Japan at eleven this morning .
__label__joy	I'd like to see that myself .
__label__joy	Thank you for saying so . Have you seen the exhibition halls ? On display are most of our products , such as silk , woolen knitwear , cotton piece goods , and garments .
__label__surprise	Why not , sir ?
__label__joy	That sounds good .
__label__joy	You're too modest . Pass me the catalogue ! I'd like to see which song to choose.Wow , this place has a large selection of songs . I dont know which to choose !
__label__surprise	She did ? Why didn't anyone tell me ?
__label__joy	I went to the tutoring service centre on campus today . And I got a job .
__label__joy	How nice to see you again !
__label__joy	How about a party at home ? That way we can get together and celebrate it .
__label__joy	I know ! She could sell fridges to Eskimos !
__label__joy	You have no idea how proud I am of myself .
__label__joy	It's hard to believe that we're really leaving . The past two weeks was like a dream .
__label__joy	Fine today , though a bit under the weather last week .
__label__joy	Actually , I could you some help . Thank you so much .
__label__joy	No , thank you . Check please .
__label__joy	Francis , you have done an outstanding work in the past six months . In view of your achievement , I trust you ’ re now indispensable part of our company and you deserve an officer director title .
__label__joy	Hey ! What is it ?
__label__joy	You bet it is . And we got four thousand for our car space ! Awesome !
__label__anger	I can't stand the stupid guy any longer.It ' s unbelievable !
__label__disgust	oh , don't mention it . It was terrible .
__label__joy	As long as I don ’ t have to row .
__label__joy	It sounds good .
__label__joy	What a charming room ! It faces south , and there's such a lovely view of the city .
__label__joy	Now there we are in agreement !
__label__surprise	You must be kidding ! You cannot get that price anywhere .
__label__joy	That's just what was running through my mind . Moonlight and dancing .
__label__joy	Great . Well , we ’ ll have to think about it , but the place looks great .
__label__joy	So do I . Let ’ s go to other areas to see what they have got , shall we ?
__label__joy	Oh , George , what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! A
__label__anger	My son has really taken it out of me . He never keeps out of mischief .
__label__anger	But the reservation keeps the car here . That ’ s why you have the reservation .
__label__joy	Great . Will that be cash or charge ?
__label__surprise	You want to be a politician ? Yuck .
__label__surprise	Really ? I thought you hated shopping ?
__label__joy	Shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks ?
__label__joy	It's the most delicious dinner I've had for a long time . It's such a rich dinner .
__label__joy	all right . i'll give it a try .
__label__sadness	Here are your keys . I ’ ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . I ’ m sorry , Tim . I wish you all the best , and I hope that one day we can meet again . I ’ ll always love you . Goodbye .
__label__joy	It looks great .
__label__joy	Thanks , I appreciate that !
__label__surprise	So there is something wrong with her ! It was beginning to sound like she was too good to be true !
__label__surprise	Really ? I don't believe I would met him , is he here now ?
__label__joy	Oh , that's interesting . Do you have a garden ?
__label__anger	Quiet everybody !
__label__surprise	Gosh , Doctor . I had only three plates of ice cream.John had four .
__label__joy	We'll see . Anyway , I'll prepare some vegetarian food for the barbecue . See you then !
__label__joy	Very good . It's been a pleasure to do business with you , Mr . Smith .
__label__joy	Yes . It's an excellent system .
__label__joy	And I was glad to receive your letter .
__label__joy	Look , daddy is on again . Don't you think he is handsome ?
__label__joy	Thank you so much .
__label__joy	Well , it was nice talking to you .
__label__joy	Well , this is my new baby . He ’ s just as much trouble . That ’ s for sure ! But , he ’ s a lot of fun !
__label__joy	Ok . Thank you .
__label__joy	It's really spectacular .

__label__joy	Congratulations !
__label__joy	You're so thoughtful.Thank you .
__label__joy	you'll love that . It's just a shot of espresso beans mixed with steam milk and some chocolate syrup .
__label__joy	No , thanks . I'm just looking .
__label__joy	Definitely ! Very relaxing .
__label__joy	Wow , I can't thank you enough .

__label__joy	And your statement reference and the payment amount . Click on next , then ' pay beneficiaries ' . That's it ! All done .
__label__sadness	How unlucky ! Let ’ s pack our bags and go home .

__label__joy	You have a perfect taste !
__label__joy	Good . That ’ s something unusual .
__label__joy	Oh ! What a beautiful dress ! It fits you so well.You look so charming in the dress .
__label__joy	I like the slow dance . I am good at rumba and waltz .
__label__joy	Lucy , come here ! I can see the lake which is in the center of park .
__label__sadness	I'm afraid you can't .
__label__joy	Oh I didn ’ t know you were married .
__label__joy	Thank you . Your order will be ready seven days from now .
__label__joy	Thanks for telling me .
__label__joy	Well , it sounds like you really enjoyed yourself .
__label__joy	Cardiopulmonary resuscitation !
__label__joy	I have a sweet tooth . I can not help but think about having something sweet between meals .
__label__joy	I'm glad that you think so . I thought it might be a bit too revealing .
__label__sadness	Mr . Wang , I want to apologize for being late again this morning . I just can't get up in time for work .
__label__surprise	Wow ! That's expensive .
__label__joy	The exterior is only half of the story . The interior is incredible .
__label__joy	Professor Wang looks so handsome today . He is wearing a light brown suit and a pink tie .
__label__surprise	But why ? Did I do anything wrong ?
__label__joy	So long . Have a nice weekend .
__label__joy	I'll pay cash , thank you .
__label__joy	I ’ m glad that you like it . This is only the first time that I made it .
__label__anger	You are so paranoid ! Not everybody is a crook , you know .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Great ! I must warn you though , whatever happens , don ’ t let me go on a drinking binge . Trust me , it ’ s not a pretty picture !
__label__sadness	I ’ m sorry . You can ’ t return it because too much time has passed since you purchased it . In order to receive a refund , you must return merchandise to the store within 90 days of purchase .
__label__surprise	Oh , really ?
__label__joy	That's what I've heard .
__label__joy	Good !
__label__sadness	Sorry , sir . We receive credit card and cash only .
__label__joy	The weather is good now , but I think it's suppose to rain this afternoon .
__label__joy	It is my pleasure , sir . I wish you a pleasant stay here . Goodbye !
__label__disgust	That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus .
__label__disgust	There's no one moderating it . Anyone around the world can put information onto the net for anyone else to see . The information on the internet is mostly unsubstantiated and you can never know who has written it , or why . A lot of people get conned online .
__label__joy	It's definitely your size .
__label__joy	All right.Gotta go , bye , keep in touch .
__label__joy	It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ?
__label__joy	I'd be glad to . I love picnicking .
__label__joy	I'm really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders .
__label__joy	Good idea . Shall we search on line to find an appropriate one or go to a phone store ?
__label__joy	Julie ! It's good to see you again . How have you been ?
__label__anger	There ’ s no way that I can stay here .
__label__joy	Oh , I think I know the place you mean . We ate there last month , right ?
__label__sadness	It sucks . But Arden told me he's satisfied with my qualifications and experience .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	It's been a long time , hasn't it ? How have you been ?
__label__joy	Ms Anderson , my name is Mike . I am Division Chief of ABC Company . Welcome to Toronto .
__label__joy	OK , OK . Get back to work . There's someone waiting for you in the kitchen ...
__label__joy	The gown is quite expensive , believe me .
__label__joy	We have achieved great success last year.The most important is that we realize our strength lies in after-sale service .
__label__sadness	Rather . I'm afraid I didn't do very well .
__label__joy	It's so pleasant after the bad weather we've been having .
__label__sadness	I am having a hard time at my job .
__label__joy	See you !
__label__surprise	Indiscretion ? How can an indiscretion last two months ? I mean , you two have been married for two years ! How can he do that to you ?
__label__surprise	Really ? That ’ s so cool .
__label__joy	Great , let ’ s go !
__label__joy	I am really interested in buying this television .
__label__anger	It's also horrible having to be at a bus stop in any kind of weather .
__label__joy	Thank you . I appreciate the compliment .
__label__joy	It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great .
__label__surprise	Really ? You must like tango , right ?
__label__anger	Break it up ! I will not permit fighting in this campus .
__label__joy	Yes , a very pleasant journey indeed . Thank you .
__label__joy	Congratulations ! You do have the right attitude .
__label__joy	It's my pleasure . Well , then . I'll say goodbye .
__label__joy	I am flattered .
__label__joy	No . The only thing I've ever done behind your back is zipping you up .
__label__joy	Okay . I ’ ll pick you up around 6
__label__anger	Give me a break , Mr Yang .
__label__surprise	Are you serious ?
__label__joy	All right .
__label__joy	I hope you like it . Oh , have the other guys arrived ?
__label__joy	Whatever ! I'm glad to learn something of Chinese kung fu . Thanks for asking me .
__label__joy	You're right ... I should eat something . Let's go .
__label__joy	Well , keep a low profile .
__label__joy	It sure is .
__label__joy	You are welcome .
__label__anger	Oh , don ’ t talk to me about last night ! It was the most awful evening I ’ Ve ever had .
__label__joy	Yes , we'll take our time . And we'll go to Five-lake Strict and the Wall Street .
__label__joy	You are welcome . I am very impressed by your capability .
__label__sadness	Let me see ... I am sorry the tables you want are booked .
__label__joy	Thanks very much .
__label__joy	I ’ Ve decided to grow my own garden !
__label__joy	I love breathing fresh air in the suburb places , while sitting in the morning sunshine .
__label__joy	I'd like to hire a bike . I think it would be a good idea to do some cycling on Sunday .
__label__joy	Good idea . I will think it over .
__label__joy	I trust that he will take good care of our country .
__label__sadness	Well , it ’ s hard to say . I coughed a lot in the evening .
__label__joy	Good evening , I'm so happy you could come .
__label__surprise	Really ? No , they couldn ’ t . None of them would have jobs if they did .
__label__joy	I hear ya . Let's do it .
__label__joy	There you go . How do you like it ?
__label__anger	Can ’ t it wait ? I ’ m watching the game right now !
__label__surprise	Cancelled ! So what am I supposed to do now ?
__label__joy	This title does not only give you a raising pay-check , but also increase responsibilities . Congratulations , and hope the best for you .
__label__anger	With that attitude , I don't really think we have much more to discuss here .
__label__joy	Listen , it is waltz . I like the elegant step of the old styles .
__label__joy	Yes , the sun shines day after day . It's neither too hot nor too cold .
__label__joy	I ’ m ready and willing to help .
__label__joy	You have done excellent work .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot . It ’ s very kind of you .
__label__joy	You stopped just in time . Good for you !
__label__joy	Oh , Paul is very easy-going and friendly .
__label__joy	Couldn't be better .
__label__joy	That's interesting . Go on !
__label__joy	That would be fine .
__label__joy	Thank you , same to you ! Lee , have you got any plans ?
__label__joy	I'm calling to tell you the shipment has arrived in good condition .
__label__joy	But of course ! Well , it ’ s been great talking to you , but I have to get going .
__label__joy	Are you serious this time ? That ’ s wonderful news .
__label__surprise	You ’ re kidding . What am I going to do ?
__label__joy	ok , I'll see you in a bit .
__label__joy	Thank you . You helped me a lot .
__label__joy	Yes , that's good . Where would you like to go ?
__label__joy	This is where we sing ? These booths are so comfortable I think could fall asleep !
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Well , how did you like the show ?
__label__joy	Yes . We hope you'll be able to join us .
__label__joy	It certainly has been a pleasure seeing you again and renewing old memories .
__label__joy	Hi , Bill , this is my new car .
__label__sadness	But I don't know what else I can do . I am willing to work hard . Sometimes I make mistakes and the boss is not happy .
__label__joy	Merry Christmas ! Let ’ s paint the town red .
__label__joy	I will . Thanks for telling me .
__label__joy	Yeah . Oh , it's delicious !
__label__anger	Not at all .
__label__joy	Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does .
__label__joy	it was good . I brough lunch from home today .
__label__surprise	wow ! No wonder people are so fat . Say , Carl , looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising .
__label__joy	At Harvard . What about you ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	So we can get down to business .
__label__joy	You're right ! So I can listen to music while riding my motorbike !
__label__joy	Great , let's go .
__label__joy	OK .
__label__joy	What time shall we go ?
__label__joy	never mind . Let's go to the falls and try again .
__label__joy	It has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park .
__label__joy	Bottoms up !
__label__joy	Haha , so you are my E-bf .
__label__joy	Can you believe I'm going to America ?
__label__joy	Thanks a lot . I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon , too . You ’ Ve been doing some great work !
__label__joy	He's really good looking .
__label__joy	Thank you . Wow , your school has so many honors . Congratulations !
__label__surprise	Do you really think so ? I don't think so . It wasn't that bad film at all . Didn't you hear the applause of the audience ?
__label__sadness	This is all too fast . He's my best friend , and now he's gone .
__label__anger	Where have you been , Alice , you're over an hour late .
__label__joy	Oh , yes . It is a fantastic city . And I like German food as well .
__label__joy	No problem ! All those deductions do add up , and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like . I can understand why you'd want some explanation .
__label__joy	Thanks ! I'm so happy . It's like a dream come true .
__label__joy	Steven Spielberg . Another superstar .
__label__joy	Look , dear . It ’ s over there .
__label__joy	Thank you very much . Your food will be ready soon .
__label__joy	It sounds nice , but don't forget this is a seedy , run-down neighborhood .
__label__joy	thanks . Who much would that come to ?
__label__joy	That sounds great . Give me a call next time you guys play .
__label__surprise	At this time ? Why don ’ t you go there tomorrow ? It is almost dark .
__label__anger	Which leg do you want to have , right leg or left one ?
__label__joy	OK . Bingo ! We win . Give me five , Mom .
__label__joy	Nice to meet you , too .
__label__joy	Hey , Karen . Look like you got some sun this weekend .
__label__joy	Thank you . I wish I would .
__label__joy	We actually met at a dance party . He fell for me .
__label__joy	Would you like to go skiing with us for christmas ?
__label__joy	I think it ’ s wonderful to see people from all over the world taking part in such a great event .
__label__joy	Surely . Let ’ s get started by drafting a new contract .
__label__surprise	Really ? I hope it hasn ’ t left without me .
__label__surprise	Oh , no ! My stub ! I can't believe it — I flushed it down the toilet !
__label__joy	I really appreciate it .
__label__surprise	Are you serious ? You studied mathematics at college for four years , and now you have a job working with your hands !
__label__joy	OK , see you then .
__label__surprise	So soon ? Why don't you stay a little longer ?
__label__joy	Well , actually it ’ s just about luck .
__label__joy	Great . How would you like to pay for it ?
__label__sadness	Sorry . I didn't know .
__label__joy	You know , I could really go for that . You don ’ t mind being my wingman for tonight ?
__label__joy	The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	That's exciting , man .
__label__joy	Good luck .
__label__joy	Oh , Jared ! I can ’ t wait for our wedding ! I hope you don ’ t mind , but I ’ Ve already chosen a date ! Six months from now in the summer ! Melissa saw you buying the ring last month so I ’ Ve had plenty of time to start planning !
__label__joy	Open this card and read .
__label__joy	Ta da ! Let's go to the Ritz !
__label__joy	Hopeful ! Thank you .
__label__joy	Oh my God , that's great !
__label__joy	That's wonderful ! Icing on the cake .
__label__anger	Shame on you !
__label__joy	Look at that pretty girl .
__label__surprise	Really ! You live in Taiwan !
__label__sadness	But you know I've been working very hard . And I have a family to support .
__label__joy	But the traffic is pretty bad .
__label__joy	Thank you so much .
__label__surprise	Hi ! Susan ! I haven ’ t seen you for ages !
__label__joy	Beautiful day , isn't it ?
__label__joy	We're happy together now . We both think that we're a well-matched couple .
__label__joy	Wow , the ferris wheel over there is so big . I'd like to take a ride on it .
__label__joy	Good . By the way , who's going to cook the meat ?
__label__anger	I have to talk to you !
__label__surprise	What are you talking about ? ! He ’ s passed every drug test he ’ s taken !
__label__joy	Oh , it ’ s love at first sight .
__label__joy	I do like Thai food . Did you see much of Bangkok ?
__label__joy	Very good , we'll take them all .
__label__anger	Look at the traffic . It ’ s terrible !
__label__surprise	Wow ! It's big ! What could it be ?
__label__joy	You are welcome .
__label__surprise	$ 520 a month ? We don ’ t often have apartments as inexpensive as that.We have one apartment for $ 599 a month , on Seventh Avenue . It ’ s near the station .
__label__joy	Me too . I feel very thirsty as well .
__label__joy	Tasty and tender ! It must be one of the famous local dishes .
__label__surprise	No kidding ! Then how do you know the bag's real ?
__label__surprise	Closed ? Are you kidding ? What is it , some kind of holiday today ?
__label__sadness	I got caught cheating . I feel so ashamed . The teacher saw me and told me I failed .
__label__sadness	Silly me !
__label__joy	Oh , yes . That would be lovely .
__label__joy	I couldn ’ t agree more .
__label__joy	How's it going ?
__label__surprise	A specialist ? That's excellent , thanks .
__label__joy	That ’ s right ! That ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . If the other player captures your king , he will say ” Check Mate ” and the game is over ! Doesn ’ t this sound fun ?
__label__joy	It ’ s my treat this time .
__label__anger	We ’ Ve been looking around for many hours.What on earth are you looking for ?
__label__joy	Thank you , Joe . What would you like to drink with your meal ? I can offer you wine , mango juice , or water .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__surprise	Oh ! What bad luck ! How can I get to the Theater ?
__label__sadness	I'm afraid not .
__label__joy	I enjoy the various characters and the plot .
__label__anger	Whatever . Just turn right here . . . The freeway will be packed at this hour . . . let ’ s take a side street . Go on ! Get out of our way ! Move , move !
__label__joy	That sounds good , but I don ’ t want this house to get away from me .
__label__joy	Bye .
__label__joy	it was a round day for me . My family attend the graduation ceremony . I was so nervous . I couldn't find my cap and gown , but all worked out in the end .
__label__joy	So do you ! How are you doing ?
__label__joy	Good-bye .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__fear	It's a large sum of money . I can't afford to lose it .
__label__joy	Oh , George , what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! And we ’ ll be able to relax in the sun while they ’ re playing .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Good luck !
__label__joy	Very good . I ’ ll take it .
__label__joy	Jay Chou's title song in his new album .
__label__fear	Well , I am wondering if we took a hang-out for a drink or something . You know , I just came back from a really tough interview . I was quite nervous during the interview . I really want to have the job . Right now , I am still a little on the edge . I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview .
__label__joy	Certainly .
__label__fear	Umm . I think my water just broke ! Get me to a hospital !
__label__joy	That's terrific.Thank you .
__label__joy	I never knew there were so many fun things to do on a farm .
__label__sadness	Someone has stolen my gold necklace .
__label__joy	No problem , Miss .
__label__surprise	Where is my wallet ? Someone has stolen my wallet !
__label__joy	I'd better see you there .
__label__joy	Oh . Graham . I love you so much and I really believe in our love .
__label__joy	She's going to be so happy . Let me have one .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__joy	It's a pleasure .
__label__anger	You just cut into line , in front of me and everyone else , that's what ! Go take your place back at the end of the line , like every - one else !
__label__joy	Cool down , man . Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic . But life isn't really all that . You should take the initiative and make some changes first .
__label__joy	Sounds nice . I'll have that please .
__label__joy	I watched the race with my children . We saw you run to the finish line . We all screamed with excitement .
__label__joy	Thanks very much and goodbye !
__label__joy	Booze !
__label__joy	Yes , he sings wonderfully .
__label__joy	It ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean .

__label__sadness	But I still love you .
__label__joy	Thanks . It's comfortable . Well , how much is it , please ?
__label__surprise	500 dollars ! That's too much ! You just said you are afraid to lose your money.If you're afraid , why do you want to gamble 500 dollars ?
__label__joy	I'll look for you at my next party .
__label__joy	I ’ m excited that Barack Obama is our President .
__label__surprise	Really ? What happened ?
__label__joy	Here you go . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Always .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	It's OK .
__label__joy	It sounds great !

__label__joy	How nice ! I can see you are busying packing . I'm sorry to interrupt you .
__label__joy	That's great . We can do something outdoors then .
__label__fear	Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ?
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__surprise	Ten kg ! Dear Shirley must have put a lead ball in it !
__label__joy	Yes . Now I've got it . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Yes . And suddenly I heard someone call my name . I turned around and there was this man looking at me . I didn't recognize him at all , but he obviously knew who I was .
__label__joy	And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does .
__label__surprise	really ?
__label__joy	Thank you . I appreciate your help .
__label__surprise	I ’ m shocked he actually won .
__label__joy	Exactly ! Move your arms in a relaxed manner . Well . don't stretch yourfingers stiffly . Just keep them in a natural shape .
__label__joy	Let's get a soft drink .
__label__joy	I love it . All my life I wanted to learn to ski . Finally I took lessons last year .
__label__joy	Hello , Kith , can you and Alice come around this evening ? We prefer your coming .

__label__joy	Thanks , Dan .
__label__anger	Don't you dare tell me that ...
__label__surprise	You ? Wow . And why don't you ever dress like that at work ?
__label__joy	It was great . The director took a lot of care while framing . They say be has good chance at winning the Oscar for best director . Also I like the actors , some really great new young actors .
__label__joy	Thank you . How much is it ?
__label__joy	Very much.What time ?
__label__joy	Thank you so much . I would really appreciate that .
__label__joy	I know . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	That's a good idea.We haven't been there for ages .
__label__joy	Haha , I just got the Ultraman costume . My Dad bought it .
__label__joy	All right . See you tomorrow .
__label__joy	I like bowling , but I prefer to be along with you .
__label__joy	Great ! Wait here ? You don ’ t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! By the way where do you keep them or practice ?
__label__joy	I propose a toast to the health of everyone here and to the success of our negotiation .
__label__surprise	You do ? Who ?
__label__anger	No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ’ t even pay for Drin
__label__joy	Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look .
__label__sadness	I'm afraid not , sir . I've made up my mind . It's something I have to do .
__label__joy	See you .
__label__joy	Oh , yes . It ’ s and excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .

__label__surprise	Really ? I want to go , too .
__label__joy	Thank you , I will . Hope to see you again next year .
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome .
__label__joy	Akha .
__label__joy	That's what we like to hear , a profitable business .
__label__joy	Really ? Thank you . I bought it in Spring Street yesterday .
__label__joy	Did you hear ? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business !
__label__joy	August bride . How nice ! By the way , who is going to be the matron of honor ?
__label__joy	Jane , what do think about this dinner ?
__label__fear	Steven ! What ’ s going on ! Who were those guys ? I didn ’ t know you have a gun ! What ’ s going on !
__label__joy	that ’ s a good idea . Put your keys in the ignition , start it up , put the car in reserve , wait for the road to be clear , and then back out of the driveway .
__label__anger	I don't get it . I'll go and have that doorman talk to you then .
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__joy	You're welcome , Diane . I hope you can visit us again soon .
__label__joy	Yes . Thank you so much .
__label__anger	Dad , it's not fair . I am so disappointed with you !
__label__joy	Yeah , those classics from the great writers .
__label__disgust	Oh , shut up.She ' s already got married .
__label__joy	Thanks and you too .
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? So , Spain is through to the next round ?
__label__joy	Yeah , I am having a party this saturday night , a sort of house warming , and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
__label__joy	That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ?
__label__joy	Thanks very much .
__label__joy	Now we know that they realize the real meaning of Christmas .
__label__anger	She made another white crack about my clothes .
__label__joy	Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant .
__label__joy	Great idea .
__label__joy	Good . Let's shake hands on this successful transaction .
__label__joy	See you later .
__label__joy	Happy birthday , Alice , here is a little something for you .
__label__joy	Oh , it is nice and cold , definitely good orange juice .
__label__joy	I can't wait to play in the water . My feet are burning when I stand on the sand .
__label__joy	Good evening.Welcome to our program .
__label__joy	How about 6:30 ?
__label__joy	Great ! Pick me up in about an hour because I think I ’ ll also get a bean bag and a dining set .
__label__joy	Cool ! I wish I could have been there !
__label__joy	Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought .
__label__joy	Shall I say around ten o'clock ?
__label__joy	Have you seen that house ?
__label__joy	That looks good . The room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom , so you wouldn ’ t be able to have all that furniture in your room .
__label__joy	Good , just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a class . Good luck !
__label__joy	All right .
__label__joy	Certainly .
__label__joy	Cooking is a hobby with me . I'm always trying to think up new recipes . I hope you like the soup . It's kind of a specialty of mine , so I hope you enjoy it .
__label__joy	Oh , this is fine .
__label__joy	My pleasure . Take care and have a nice trip .
__label__joy	So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea !
__label__joy	I'll see you later then . Have a great day !
__label__joy	Good habit . How long does it take ?
__label__joy	We appreciate your business , Madam .
__label__joy	Haha , very funny , but it doesn't make any sense to me .
__label__joy	Yeah , I think it will be wonderful .
__label__joy	Yeah , a dancing queen . Wanna go and join them ?
__label__joy	Not at all .
__label__joy	These shoes are great ! What is the price of this ?
__label__disgust	Nasty . You'd better not rub your eyes .
__label__joy	Thank you for showing me your offices , Mr . Becker . I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs .
__label__joy	That's very thoughtful of you . Thank you so much .
__label__joy	Your appetite is good .
__label__joy	OK . ( Sit on the sofa ) Wow ! Your house was decorated so beautiful .
__label__sadness	What a pity !
__label__joy	That ’ s great . Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	( The waiter makes the cocktail for Mr . Bellow and hands into him . ) Here is your Shanghai cocktail , Mr . Bellow .
__label__joy	Roger Vargas is up at bat . The pitcher winds up and strike one !
__label__surprise	Can you believe that he actually won ?
__label__anger	I need to file a complaint .
__label__joy	Great ! Do you think you have a chance at getting the job ?
__label__joy	Haha . April Fool's ! Did you forget what day it is today ?
__label__surprise	Wow , good for you .
__label__joy	I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art .
__label__surprise	Really ? You are so kind .
__label__joy	Yes . We've lived in Taiwan for a while . I had a gas stove in the States , too .
__label__joy	Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .
__label__anger	Wait , what are you doing ! You can ’ t just kiss me then go for second base !
__label__surprise	You must be joking.Those two .
__label__joy	She is expecting .
__label__joy	Thank you , and I'm sorry for the change of plans .
__label__joy	Sure . Once you get the hang of it , it ’ s a piece of cake ! It ’ s nothing to worry about .
__label__surprise	What for ?
__label__joy	And special TV programs , fire crackers and the games to play .
__label__joy	Hey , Jordan , is that you ? Long time no see !
__label__joy	Thank you for your consideration . We will inform you of our intention as soon as possible .
__label__joy	Yes , you are right .
__label__joy	Not really . I wasn ’ t looking for a holiday romance , but my sister told me that she had promised him that she ’ d set him up on blind date with me . I didn ’ t think I ’ d have anything to lose , so I went .
__label__joy	Your knowledge of English is really surprising .
__label__joy	You dance beautifully .
__label__anger	a bit ? I'm extremely annoyed that he didn't phone me when he promised me that he would ! He's such a liar .
__label__surprise	oh really , Frank ? What kind of movies do you like ?
__label__joy	Ha ! She is too little .
__label__joy	Of course . What do you want to move first ?
__label__joy	Yes . I appreciate all help and in particular , all the time that you've spent on my account during my stay here .
__label__surprise	Well , here you are . Size six . Woman's . 137 dollars.Wow , what a waste of money !
__label__joy	Perfect . And I like her charming eyes , too .
__label__joy	Yes , it can make people feel as if they were in the land of fairies .
__label__joy	It's an important birthday .
__label__joy	Wow , that's really interesting . So who won ?
__label__joy	Yes , I'm dating someone . Her name is Amanda .
__label__joy	All right .
__label__anger	No , no way ! What happened ? Give me my money !
__label__joy	Oh , then it'll be one dollar twenty five cents . Thank you .
__label__joy	I was in a comfortable place , so really , it ’ s no problem . I am happy to see you . Did the rain hold you up long ?
__label__anger	I'm so angry . I feel like killing someone .
__label__joy	I did actually but I think I met some of the friendliest people in China . They soon showed me the way !
__label__joy	First of all , it ’ s absolutely gorgeous .
__label__joy	Sure , I used to catch my legal limit of bass there all the time .
__label__joy	Great idea ! As long as I don't get food poisoning ! So what is on the menu tonight ?
__label__joy	It's a ETV palace ! I'm glad I brought my platinum card .
__label__fear	Yeah ?
__label__joy	Great ! Thanks a lot !
__label__joy	My pleasure , bye !
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__joy	That'd be wonderful , Peter . But I hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning .
__label__joy	I think that would be perfect .
__label__sadness	But I lost the chance .
__label__joy	I'm glad to hear it .
__label__joy	Thanks for the advice . I guess you ’ re right . It ’ s just hard to overcome my shyness . I really will try from now on . I promise .
__label__joy	Well , you know that this job center is here for your use , so help yourself . Good luck !
__label__joy	That was a really good meal , Gordon .
__label__joy	Don ’ t mention it .
__label__sadness	I'm afraid I can't complete my paper on time .
__label__surprise	Really ? That ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room .
__label__anger	I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It's unbelievable .
__label__joy	You're so kind .
__label__joy	I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ?
__label__anger	I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that night , but she didn't answer the phone .
__label__joy	This is your room . What do you think of it ?
__label__joy	Thank you for shopping here .
__label__surprise	Gee ! There's only thirty minutes to go .
__label__anger	Let me go to school , please ! I'm sick of medicine , sick of soup , and sick of being sick !
__label__disgust	Ohhhh . I hate this part of my job .
__label__joy	Yes , it is the right one
__label__surprise	Really ? How often do you go there ?
__label__joy	Good , because my friend Wendy is getting married and I ’ m organizing her party !
__label__joy	I ’ ll pick you up at ... say , 7,30 ?
__label__joy	Vodka martini ?
__label__joy	That is a good idea , I love it . What time do you think is convenient ?
__label__joy	Thank you again !
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	He told me the tests were negative and there was nothing wrong with me .
__label__joy	Tom ? Oh , it's been a while since we've talked to each other . Nice to hear you again .
__label__joy	You , too .
__label__joy	If you need help , don ’ t hesitate to ask me .
__label__surprise	Oh , so heavy ! What have you put in here ?
__label__joy	I'm okay , thank you . I already checked out the address on MapQuest .
__label__joy	Sure.Thank you very much .
__label__joy	I almost did ! Actually , I don't know that much about coffee , even though I sell it .
__label__joy	Yes , it is .
__label__joy	There have been so many dry winters lately that it's about time , don't you think ?
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__joy	Very good .
__label__joy	There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different.Would you like to go to a concert ?
__label__joy	Sure . Meet me at five .
__label__fear	My hair stood on end when I saw the bloody scene .
__label__joy	Well , everything is packed and ready to go .
__label__disgust	This is awful ! It's like drinking saltwater ! It's like drowning in the ocean !
__label__joy	The food there is pretty good .
__label__surprise	Oh , my . What did you do ?
__label__surprise	Are you kidding ? Don't you know I can't swim ?
__label__joy	Hey , wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime ?
__label__joy	I know doctor , thank you so much .
__label__joy	Would you like something to drink ? I've got tea and some grape juice .
__label__joy	Very good . You can pick up your order in one week .
__label__joy	Even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun .
__label__joy	The macadamia cake was out-of-this-world !
__label__sadness	I feel life is meaningless without him .
__label__sadness	Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment .
__label__surprise	Really ? Good luck for them .
__label__joy	Let's go sit in the back . All the cool kids do .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Oh , fine . Hey , why don't we grab a bite to eat and do some catching up ?
__label__joy	That's quite reasonable .
__label__joy	The kids said that they wanted to go to a party at the hotel . There ’ s a special one just for kids .
__label__joy	How does 7:30 sound ?
__label__surprise	Your knowledge of English is really surprising .
__label__joy	That's very kind of you . Thank you . Er ... have you got a pencil ?
__label__anger	Well , look here . Ten new typewriters were delivered to my company yesterday afternoon and only five of them work properly .
__label__joy	You're welcome , Let me go wrap the ground beef up for you .
__label__joy	Aright . Have fun on Saturday .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot . I'll tell him .
__label__joy	Recently it's been pretty good , actually .
__label__sadness	I'll try . I'm under a lot of pressure right now .
__label__sadness	Yeah . It's boring . I'd rather read something more exciting .
__label__surprise	Really ? What's he been doing ?
__label__joy	Of course ! And here's the best part , they are court side seats !
__label__joy	You're right , no problems . You are becoming quite the expert , Mr Lawson . If any problem does turn up , which I'm sure it won't , I'll give you a call .
__label__joy	There you go . Problem solved .
__label__joy	It will be held at the Music Hall .
__label__joy	I am looking forward to returning to this restaurant .
__label__surprise	Oh really ? I ’ ll come along with you if that ’ s ok .
__label__surprise	Really ? That's great to know .
__label__joy	I see . So great .
__label__joy	I ’ m standing in front of an exquisite work of art !
__label__joy	Of course not !
__label__surprise	Oh really ? Who was the instructor ? There are like 4 different instructors to choose from .
__label__joy	It looks like you could use it . Don ’ t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again .
__label__surprise	Really ? Where did you hear that ?
__label__joy	It tastes really great . Did you cook it ?
__label__joy	I'd like to very much .
__label__joy	All right . Thanks .
__label__joy	Yes , nice . But I prefer this wooden house with a garden fence and a sloping roof .
__label__joy	That ’ s very good .
__label__joy	That sounds good .
__label__fear	Hello ? Yes , someone has passed out at Dongle Ave . and 2nd street . He isn't breathing and doesn't have a pulse . Yes , my friend is performing CPR . Ok , thank you . They are sending an ambulance . Here , let me help .
__label__joy	Certainly . ( Take a table-cloth to her )
__label__joy	That's great . It seems that Typhoon is not as bad as earthquake .
__label__joy	Oh , I see them.Some are doing Taijiquan , some are performing swordplay , some are practising the Chinese Wushu .
__label__surprise	How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ?
__label__anger	And so , I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project . As you know , you ’ Ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week , and this will negativity impact the team ’ s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project .
__label__joy	Pleased to meet you too , Ms . Pewless . I travel a lot every year on business , but this is my first visit to your country . I must say I have been much impressed by your friendly people .
__label__sadness	Yes , I kept on typing it until midnight , but it is lost .
__label__joy	Yeah , it's really a unique experience . It's a solo concert by Pavarotti . He put on the performance in the Forbidden City in Beijing .
__label__joy	No , thank you . I've had enough .
__label__joy	Yes , maybe another choice might be better .
__label__surprise	I ’ m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological .
__label__joy	That's splendid . Can you take three pictures of me with them ?
__label__joy	What a lovely day . The sun is shinning and the sky is so blue . It's a perfect day to go to the beach and get a beautiful tan .
__label__anger	addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way !
__label__joy	Thank you . I'll have one .
__label__joy	Yeah , maybe you are right !
__label__joy	Happy New Year , Thomas . How many joys nice drinks with us , will you ?
__label__anger	We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet !
__label__joy	I will .
__label__sadness	Oh , thank God . We all felt frightened by the bad new about him .
__label__joy	Not at all . I ’ ll be glad to do it .
__label__surprise	Poor Danny . You are so enfeebled !
__label__joy	Hello , Hanson . Today I come to say goodbye to you , for I'm going back to London tomorrow .
__label__joy	That will be great .
__label__joy	That was a cake walk.It ’ s nothing to speak of .
__label__joy	You can say that again .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Wow !
__label__sadness	Just a moment and I'll get your order right away . Sorry to cause the inconvenience .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry . I didn't reconfirm in time and they gave away half of the seats .
__label__surprise	Really ? I thought I was doing well .
__label__joy	How nice of you to come !
__label__joy	You don't want to join him ?
__label__surprise	What ? But today is my birthday !
__label__joy	It doesn't matter , I can teach you .
__label__joy	Thank you . Same to you .
__label__joy	Wow , you are so lucky . I saw that one on TV . But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall .
__label__joy	Good bye .
__label__joy	That would be great .
__label__joy	LL
__label__joy	I've got quite a few pictures of all different kinds of fish . I'll show them to you next time I see you .
__label__joy	All right .
__label__joy	Remember the garden party they gave when we were in England ?
__label__joy	I just bought a new atlas . I ’ m looking this map of the world . Look at Russia ! That ’ s a vast country .
__label__joy	Three thousand . Please check it , sir . Thank you and have a good day .
__label__surprise	You remember me ! Yes , I'm with Li Wang Enterprises ; I'm the Accountant Peters .
__label__joy	Her birthday is on the 9th . We ’ re going to have dinner at a Mexican restaurant , and then maybe go out dancing .
__label__sadness	Sorry , but do not worry . I think I can fix it . Just cut a little more off the temple .
__label__joy	Well , I wish you good luck !
__label__joy	Sure , let's go .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__joy	Sure . Please write down your name and your phone number .
__label__joy	He prefers suits to jackets .
__label__joy	Yes , and I look many pictures .
__label__joy	Then keep up the good work .
__label__joy	Please help yourself to whatever you like , don't be shy .
__label__surprise	Do you mean that you ’ re self-supporting ? I didn ’ t even know you had a job !
__label__anger	Stay away from me .
__label__joy	They have the freshest foods there .
__label__sadness	I just had a terrible week .
__label__sadness	Sally , do you really need to go ?
__label__joy	Just a moment please . Yes . You can have a seat .
__label__joy	I am flying like a bird .
__label__joy	I think you ’ Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ?
__label__joy	Yeah . It ’ s pretty .
__label__joy	It was very good . I followed it right to the end .
__label__joy	Oh , well , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance .
__label__joy	Thank you so much .
__label__joy	There's a story about breakdancing in the paper .
__label__joy	Hi , I am so glad to see you .
__label__joy	sounds good , and I don't have to queue up at the cashier .
__label__surprise	Really ? I had no idea . Let me check.Yes , it's dead . There's no dial tone .
__label__joy	Thanks for inviting me to work out with you , Joan .
__label__joy	Cool ! But isn't that a hot air popcorn popper ?
__label__surprise	Are you kidding me ? Why do you say so ?
__label__joy	Awesome !
__label__joy	Believe it !
__label__joy	Now this next dish is one of the most famous . Foreigners call it papaya salad but the proper name is Tom Sam . It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables including shredded unripened papaya and tomato .
__label__joy	Of course . This is a great chance for me to show off my beautiful voice .
__label__joy	The neighbourhood is nice too . There is a park nearby .
__label__surprise	Serious ? Only the proof of my address .
__label__joy	If only we could eat there once more !
__label__joy	Congratulations on the new house !
__label__surprise	Sir , may I please see your license and registration ? Do you know how fast you were going ?
__label__joy	I'm filthy rich ! Haven't you heard about the MicroPower deal ?
__label__joy	Sorry , but I've gotta run . Enjoy your food , and ring the service button if you need anything else !
__label__surprise	Wow ! Nobody told me about that . Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ?
__label__joy	Oh ! That sounds great ! How about six o'clock ?
__label__joy	What does he look like ? Can people tell ?
__label__joy	And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies . I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions .
__label__anger	Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
__label__joy	Great . I ’ m looking forward to it .
__label__sadness	I am sorry , sir . Your fish will be ready in five minutes so you can't change it .
__label__joy	Oh , my family's going to love this one . I'll take it .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry . I'll ask next time .
__label__anger	Dammit ! I asked for sunny side up ! How many times do I have to tell you .
__label__joy	Me too .
__label__joy	That ’ s a good idea .
__label__joy	Sarah and I could see eye to eye with each other .
__label__joy	Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ?
__label__joy	It's no problem at all .
__label__joy	Oh , great ! It's delicious . You see , I am already putting on weight . There is one thing I don't like however , MSG .
__label__joy	You are pretending !
__label__joy	I like it . Naturally it can arouse your feelings .
__label__anger	But where have you been , Alice ? You're over an hour late .
__label__sadness	Sorry , sir . The prices here are all fixed .
__label__joy	This place is great . I'm surprised there are so many things here .
__label__joy	You are welcome .
__label__surprise	Whoa ! Oh , no !
__label__joy	Oh , I'll have a try .
__label__joy	Pretty good , thanks . And you ?
__label__joy	Thank you , Lisa .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	Mmm ... let me think . Oh , I know just a person . An old colleague of mine , Jim Thomas , is coming here to do some research this summer , from June to August .
__label__joy	Since we live in the same neighbourhood , maybe we can help each other from now on .
__label__anger	And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
__label__joy	Yeah , beautiful sunshine , pleasant scenery and many new friends
__label__joy	Thank you . I'm through with one steamed bread and I'd like a second helping .
__label__joy	Yep . I placed a bid for the shirt . The minimum was ten so I bet fifty !
__label__joy	That's quite good . Thank you for telling me about those .
__label__joy	You , too .
__label__joy	Sure , we have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the sweater . Look at this section .
__label__anger	Yeah , yeah , we ’ re here because we feel this is an injustice ! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop ! We ’ re there to show the government that we don ’ t like the way that they ’ re spending our tax dollars !
__label__surprise	really ? That ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room .
__label__surprise	Today ?
__label__joy	Ok . got it.That ' ll be $ 6.50 . Thank you for your order.it will be there in 20 minutes .
__label__joy	You bet . I'm really excited .
__label__joy	It's good , try it . What do you think ?
__label__sadness	Sorry , I'm very near sighted .
__label__surprise	You're kidding !
__label__surprise	Recliner ? In my beautifully decorated living room ? I don ’ t think so !
__label__sadness	Bummer . I guess we're both out of luck .
__label__joy	Sure . The bittersweet perfume has a calming effect on the nerves .
__label__joy	congratulations ! You must be very proud of your achievement .
__label__joy	See you then .
__label__fear	I love that dish as well . It is coconut chicken with rice .
__label__joy	Where are you from ?
__label__surprise	Why ?
__label__joy	I have to go home now , Jenny . Thanks for inviting me to your party .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry . I must have made a mistake . I'll bring them for you at once .
__label__joy	Oh , come on ! Just a quick one !
__label__joy	Sure . I like the writer's language , too .
__label__joy	Um ... well , actually , we had a fantastic time last night . He was ... amazing !
__label__joy	That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot .
__label__sadness	I am sorry . I am very tired . I'm going to bed early .
__label__joy	Thanks . Things are going to be different now .
__label__joy	Oh , he's my uncle.Come to my house at seven this evening . I'll introduce you to him .
__label__surprise	Turn on the radio ? What for ?
__label__joy	It ’ s very nice of you to say so . I should say you are glamorous yourself , as a matter of fact .
__label__surprise	Oh , no ! I can't have failed . surely ?
__label__joy	Come on ! It is really a fun game .
__label__joy	As a matter of fact , you are really a terrific photographer .
__label__joy	Great ! So , are you ready for a full day of shopping ?
__label__joy	Thanks . I'd love to . What time is the show ?
__label__joy	They're cute . But do you think you'll wear them much ?
__label__joy	That would work out great ! Why don't we call and get a reservation ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__disgust	The internet's a lot worse .
__label__sadness	It gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed .
__label__joy	I don't know about all of that , but think about it , their business gets free publicity !
__label__joy	Good idea . Do you want a wash or a massage ? Massage is especially good when you are tired .
__label__surprise	A coffee grinder ?
__label__joy	That would be great ! Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That ’ s assuming you don ’ t mind if I call you sometime .
__label__joy	Ok . See you tomorrow .
__label__anger	Yes , but you might have told me before .
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__disgust	I can ’ t bear to look at it . I ’ m rather disappointed .
__label__joy	Great , so what happens now ?
__label__joy	Yeah , you ’ re quite right and what ’ s your hobby ?
__label__joy	A foot massage sounds like a great idea . They are very relaxing . I ’ d also like to have a mudpack on my face . It ’ s supposed to help with your complexion .
__label__joy	You are welcome .
__label__disgust	He stays up untill all hours of the night , and he never lifts a finger to help .
__label__joy	Anyway , I owe you one . Are you free tonight ?
__label__joy	Yes , very . I thought the last speaker was especially good .
__label__joy	Of course .
__label__joy	That was a pretty good shot , Mary .
__label__surprise	Special effects ? Baloney ! That movie was made on a shoestring budget . They've been using trick photography like that for years
__label__joy	Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow .
__label__joy	Thank you , the service was good
__label__joy	Wonderful .
__label__joy	Yesterday morning was beautiful I thought the sunning was going to continue .
__label__joy	OK , sir . We will be there right now ... sir , your table is ready .
__label__joy	You're welcome . I'd like you to join us for dinner again sometime .
__label__joy	Thank you , but I hate having to leave here and working abroad .
__label__disgust	The kitchen stinks .
__label__joy	Good . I think I'll choose this single breasted one . When can I get it ?
__label__joy	It's sounds like fun .
__label__joy	Here you are , Miao Ping . Don't laugh at the horrible photo today , OK ?
__label__joy	Thanks so much . I owe you one .
__label__sadness	I know . I am sorry that I yelled at you .
__label__surprise	What , your short already , sir .
__label__joy	Yes , I like it very much .
__label__sadness	Yeah , I know , but it's too hard to do .
__label__joy	It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it .
__label__joy	Thanks . My name's Nick .
__label__joy	I ’ d love to but I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . I ’ Ve already got a lunch engagement .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	I am glad we've straightened everything out .
__label__joy	It smells good . Look at these . They make my mouth watering .
__label__joy	I've no idea . I'd like to listen to your suggestion .
__label__joy	Goodbye .
__label__surprise	You ’ re kidding .
__label__joy	That's different . When I'm working , I'm in a different frame of mind . But , when I even think about asking her out , I get tongue-tied . At least in a note , I can get the words out without turning beet red .
__label__joy	Thank you . I have got quite clear idea of it .
__label__joy	You've made an excellent choice , sir .
__label__surprise	Really ? Where did you go ?
__label__disgust	Ah , get back to you .
__label__joy	Thanks for coming ! We should meet again sometime soon .
__label__joy	That ’ s great . But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain .
__label__joy	thanks for understanding .
__label__joy	Well , I hope scientists don ’ t decode to make a clone of me in the future ! I wouldn ’ t like to be the subject of an experiment .
__label__joy	that sounds good . I'm going to start with an Italian tiramisu .
__label__joy	My friend Jane is very beautiful .
__label__joy	you are dressed to kill . You look gorgeous , Alexander .
__label__joy	Here's your change . Thank you for shopping with us .
__label__sadness	My stress level is pretty much what is usually is .
__label__joy	I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older .
__label__joy	Many companies and universities investing resources in genetics , because there are so many possibilities . Few people know where next discoveries will be made .
__label__anger	It is . Hurry up ! You ’ ll be late for school .
__label__surprise	really ? that's interesting !
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Which team do you think will win ?
__label__anger	I know ! But it's really important to her ! Her whole life could be ruined by this man !
__label__surprise	Hmm , 250NT is ... 8 dollars ? ! ! And you can't even eat them ? You're crazy !
__label__joy	I do , but I would appreciate you , if it could be arranged .
__label__joy	Sure.thanks .
__label__surprise	Engaged . Oh , dear ! Could you tell her it's a long-distance call ?
__label__surprise	Oh , here it is . Patulin . Oh , no !
__label__anger	That's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ?
__label__joy	Fine .
__label__joy	Yes . I moved here last week .
__label__joy	I like beefsteak very much . Have you tried Chinese dishes ?
__label__disgust	I agree .
__label__joy	That sounds like a good idea .
__label__joy	Ok , a bottle of the house red please !
__label__joy	It sure is . They also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . The Center staff members are also friendly and helpful . Everyone loves them .
__label__joy	Thank you very much , Mr . Parker . But , that is my job .
__label__fear	I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me .
__label__joy	I ’ d like to wish you every success in your new venture .
__label__joy	See you . Have a nice day !
__label__joy	I think you're right . Aright . Gotta go to class . Thanks for the cigarette . I'll talk to you later .
__label__joy	Great ! Phew ! That was a close one ! You had me going there for a minute I thought I was gonna have to slap some sense into you .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__anger	I ’ m not going to accept this excuse . You ’ re using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you ’ Ve missed your deadline . Look , we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards . No more phoney cases . If you ’ re in over your head , you tell me . No more missed deadlines . Now , I want that data on my desk by nine am !
__label__surprise	Is that so ?
__label__joy	You're a really good cook .
__label__joy	You're right . I'll take them all .
__label__sadness	But it hurts too much .
__label__joy	We do many things . In the morning , we go swimming and boating . In the afternoon , we play basketball or tennis . We sit around a camp fire at night.We sing or tell stories .
__label__anger	I don't need your help , jerk .
__label__anger	It's unfair .
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome .
__label__sadness	Totally not . Perhaps it's about our marriage .
__label__disgust	I know you , Zina . You're only nice when you want something .
__label__joy	Thank you , they are beautiful .
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__joy	Happy birthday , Ann . Many happy returns of the day ! Here is a present for you .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , but you got on the wrong bus .
__label__sadness	Take care ! I will miss you so much .
__label__surprise	Is he really ?
__label__joy	that ’ s great . Thanks very much . Would you like a cup of tea or coffee ?
__label__joy	That's a good idea !
__label__joy	Well , I can't make it on Friday either , but I'm free on Saturday night . What time does it start ?
__label__joy	I'm Charlie . Nice to meet you .
__label__joy	And it's calm . I like the peace .
__label__joy	Thank you for saying so .
__label__joy	You know in China we usually don't open presents until the guests leave .
__label__anger	Really ? Who made that rule up ?
__label__joy	I love Chinese food .
__label__joy	Thanks for your help , Ralph !
__label__joy	Yes , thanks .
__label__joy	I really appreciate your driving me around .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__fear	Cindy , I'm scared .
__label__joy	Great idea !
__label__joy	The view is breathtaking .
__label__joy	Yes , of course . It was nice to see you .
__label__joy	Mmm ! Beer , tequila , and ... lime !
__label__fear	But in my case , the fact matches the theory . Mike is humorous , energetic , always as fresh as a daisy , but probably too ambitious . It frightens me !
__label__joy	Thank you for coming . I'm glad you liked it .
__label__joy	Well , how about tomorrow night ? Are you doing anything then ?
__label__joy	Yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day .
__label__surprise	No one in the family expected to get a dime from him . It was quite a surprise .
__label__joy	How about a party at home ? That way we can get together and celebrate it .
__label__joy	Sounds like a good car ! How many miles to the gallon ?
__label__joy	You are welcome .
__label__joy	We are just going round the corner for a drink . Won't you join us ?
__label__surprise	Oh , my god ! Only two hours left before the plane takes off . We need to be at the airport now .
__label__joy	Would you please go to a dancing party with me ?
__label__sadness	I ’ m sorry sir . This computer is not broken or damaged . It ’ s simply just too old ! That ’ s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ’ t much I can do .
__label__joy	She looks very beautiful . She is a nice girl .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Okay . See you then .
__label__anger	You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
__label__joy	I like the sight and the sound.It worked on me like a magic when I was a child .
__label__joy	Not bad . Actually , it makes me look younger . I like it .
__label__joy	Oh , man . I had the best supper last night . My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing !
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Amazing . The sun is almost gone and yet there is still color everywhere !
__label__joy	You ’ re right , I don ’ t want to pay , but I don ’ t want to live without pay , either .
__label__joy	It ’ s nice to meet you , Mr . Stevens .
__label__joy	No , he's perfectly harmless . And he's not afraid of strangers either . Here , hold him .
__label__joy	Hello , Julia , I know a party that will begin at midnight . Would you love to go ?
__label__joy	I am so happy that she's doing okay .
__label__joy	Thank you so much , I would really appreciate that .
__label__surprise	Really ? This is a beautiful town .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__surprise	Really ? He looks so young .
__label__joy	Good.If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong .
__label__joy	I really appreciate you doing this for me .
__label__joy	These roses should make your wife very happy .
__label__joy	Your mentality is very good and that's great .
__label__joy	Fine . Thank you very much . Bye-bye .
__label__joy	I know it is .
__label__surprise	Really ? You are joking ?
__label__anger	No way ! Please don't follow me around .
__label__joy	It's a lovely day , isn't it ?
__label__surprise	Guess what ! I know something you don't know !
__label__joy	I prefer the old style of dance because I enjoy holding a pretty girl like you closely .
__label__sadness	And my writing is not good . I feel so frustrated .
__label__joy	OK . Wish me luck !
__label__joy	All right . I think I'll take it .
__label__joy	Alright , I'll get it .
__label__joy	Alright . I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
__label__joy	I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado.but I must admit , this sure is a nice spring day .
__label__joy	That would be fine . Where are you going ?
__label__joy	Sounds good . May I come over tomorrow to take a look ?
__label__joy	I am so honored to hear that . Well , after staying here for several days , you must have some ideas about our company . We have been in the clothes field for many years , and yours brand is also well-known in the country . How about our cooperation ?
__label__joy	Shall I give you a ride home ?
__label__joy	You'll have to try for yourself some day .
__label__surprise	Really ? It's nice to meet you . How long have you been with this company ?
__label__surprise	Really !
__label__sadness	Yes , I can't sleep well every night .
__label__joy	Oh , you are so nice . What a lovely scarf .
__label__joy	No hurry ! I'll tell you now . The collections include ancient cases and caskets , tea sets , abacuses , precious sea shells and conches , jars and water abacuses for study use , drama costumes , agates , ancient coins , butterflies , fans , mini musical instruments , root-carving , rare stones and rocks , model ships , model cars .
__label__surprise	Really ? He looks so young .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Thanks . And of course , could you fill in the exchange form ?
__label__joy	All right .
__label__joy	I'm glad you like it . I don't care for it . Why don't you finish my tiramisu so that I can try one of those fried bananas ?
__label__joy	And maybe you suddenly have new interests . I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid . For instance , you used to sleep in every morning , but because she jogs every morning then you begin to like jogging .
__label__joy	Certainly . What can I do for you ?
__label__surprise	Really ? You're an amazing bargain hunter ! Next time there's a sale , promise you'll let me tag along with you .
__label__joy	Yes , please . I'm a little thirsty , actually .
__label__joy	Thanks a bunch .
__label__joy	Don't be afraid . She isn't going to bite you .
__label__joy	Hey , Wen ! Welcome to D . C . ! Glad you came out to visit !
__label__joy	See you then .
__label__surprise	Can I ?
__label__anger	I feel itchy ! I can ’ t stand it anymore ! I think I may be coming down with something . I feel lightheaded and weak .
__label__joy	Yes , if that's all right for you .
__label__joy	A barrel of fun , of course . He often says that I'm a date bait .
__label__joy	Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time .
__label__joy	That's right . I thought I'd give it a shot .
__label__sadness	You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ’ t sleep well . What ’ s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation .
__label__joy	Well , I don ’ t mean to boast but all the designs are done by myself and some colleagues are already trying to copy some of them for their new apartments . Look , they are making photos now of my designed kitchen .
__label__joy	I very much like to go to a cafe and doze in the afternoon sunshine .
__label__joy	new furniture makes a room seem so fresh . I see that you also bought a new lamp for your bedside table .
__label__joy	What do you do in your spare time ?
__label__surprise	Really ? Let ’ s go there .
__label__joy	Happy to know you , Tim .
__label__joy	Thanks for coming .
__label__anger	It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !
__label__joy	O . K . Thanks , Mom !
__label__joy	Thank you , Ma'am .
__label__joy	Thank you . Pls hurry , I am late . Can I get to the Battery Park before 4 ?
__label__disgust	I wasn't happy with it .
__label__joy	Oh , how splendid ! Can you take a picture of me here ?
__label__joy	How about the Korean restaurant next to it ?
__label__joy	Good.If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong .
__label__disgust	Nonsense ! There's no indication that he's in love with me .
__label__joy	Oh , very beautiful . Thank you , Steven , I like it very much .
__label__sadness	That's unfair , Mom .
__label__joy	My pleasure .
__label__anger	Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long
__label__joy	I'd like that very much .
__label__joy	Good idea ! We'll have to get right on it .
__label__joy	It's very thoughtful of you to invite me to your wedding .
__label__surprise	Wow ! It's a trivia game all about the Academy Awards .
__label__joy	There are so many flavors of ice cream to choose from !
__label__joy	I'd enjoy that .
__label__anger	What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking .
__label__joy	Oh , yes that would be nice .
__label__joy	Sure . I'm going to take more pictures today .
__label__joy	Congratulations ! Is it a boy or a girl ?
__label__joy	It's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz .
__label__joy	I didn't know about it . What did you do ?
__label__joy	Many thanks for your present . I'm so glad you are able to come .
__label__surprise	I thought he only liked to listen ?
__label__sadness	I am sorry , but I can't lend it to you now , for I haven't finished reading it . If you don't mind , I can lend you some back numbers to you .
__label__joy	Oh , it looks well . I like it very much .
__label__disgust	I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
__label__joy	Yeah , and we can get to know each other at the party .
__label__sadness	I am sorry , it's out of stock right now .
__label__joy	that'd be great ! I know he'd appreciate your help .
__label__joy	The city is small , not very modern , but there are many mountains with lots of trees around the city , so the air there is pretty fresh .
__label__joy	The chicken is out of this world !
__label__joy	What a brilliant smile !
__label__joy	Yes , I did . I have never tasted anything like this .
__label__joy	Please sit down . Help yourself just like you are at home .
__label__joy	Great . Then , after we remove the carpet , we need to redo all the wood floors . Right ?
__label__joy	Sure it was .
__label__joy	I've heard you're going to America tomorrow . I want to see you off at the airport .
__label__joy	Luckily not.The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss .
__label__joy	There's still a lot left-have some more !
__label__joy	That ’ s a possibility . Thanks !
__label__joy	Would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?
__label__joy	Did you enjoy your dinner ?
__label__anger	I can ’ t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure .
__label__sadness	His excuse was familiar . He said his car died again .
__label__joy	You should . Many Guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the morning .
__label__joy	That sounds all right to us .
__label__anger	Aw , Mom-you're such a drag .
__label__joy	thanks , I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . Are you ok ?
__label__sadness	I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job .
__label__joy	Oh , that would be lovely . Thank you .
__label__sadness	Sorry , madam . I afraid you have a wrong number.we don't have Mr Over here .
__label__joy	If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book .
__label__joy	Me too . I finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people .
__label__joy	Don ’ t mention it .
__label__joy	It looks delicious . Can you tell me how to enjoy it ? It's my first time to eat it .
__label__joy	Ok , got it . I will call you sometime next week .
__label__joy	Good idea . I'll go shopping in one of the department stores nearby . We'll go to the zoo and the park another time . After all , we can put that off .
__label__surprise	What ? Why ? I mean , we ’ Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ’ re happy together , aren ’ t we ?
__label__joy	I'll take one , too .
__label__surprise	Good ? ! For them but not to me .
__label__joy	It's so beautiful here . I want to stay longer .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__joy	Trina , will you marry me ?
__label__joy	Your knowledge of English is really surprising .
__label__surprise	but why ? Did I do anything wrong ?
__label__joy	Here's your receipt . Thank you for shopping here and have a nice day .
__label__joy	Isn't that a silly question ? You know how much of an athlete I am .
__label__joy	Ok , how does this sound , “ I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there . So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes . ”
__label__joy	Julia Roberts .
__label__surprise	Oh , no . What kind of trouble ?
__label__joy	You are in luck . We just receive a shipment of several different styles of white purses .
__label__joy	Sure . Thanks .
__label__joy	That is good news .
__label__joy	Looks good ! I ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
__label__joy	Gee ! I don't know what to say ! Thanks so much .
__label__joy	“ You ain't nothing ' but a hound-dog ... ”
__label__joy	Great , thanks .
__label__joy	Excellent choice . I love its smooth flavor .
__label__joy	they are all good .
__label__joy	Thanks , goodbye .
__label__fear	Ah , thanks .
__label__joy	No problem . Bob .
__label__surprise	Dance class ! I don't know how .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__surprise	Oh , I didn't know that .
__label__surprise	You idiot ! Don ’ t say that ! Do you want this job , or not ?
__label__joy	Have you seen that house ?
__label__joy	You ‘ re welcome .
__label__joy	Thanks for saying so , but my husband thinks otherwise .
__label__joy	Excellent . I'll start practicing my dance moves .
__label__sadness	That ’ s just it , I ’ m not happy anymore , Tim . It ’ s not you , it ’ s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
__label__joy	No more , thank you .
__label__sadness	It's a pity . I'm afraid that's too loud for me.Thank you .
__label__joy	Thanks , that's would be lovely.You ' r right , he is kind and nice looking .
__label__joy	Well , welcome to our country . I trust you are having a pleasant stay ?
__label__joy	My pleasure . ( It was my pleasure . )
__label__anger	It's all your fault ! Now we can't get in shopping .
__label__joy	It's delicious .
__label__joy	I'm happy to hear that , but publishing is more than just talking to writers . it involves a lot of work , patience and responsibility . Most of the work is boring .
__label__surprise	A crate of beer ? Why do we need that ?
__label__joy	That's all right
__label__joy	Nice day today , isn't it ?
__label__joy	Thank you for making a reservation with us . We look forward to seeing you in April !
__label__joy	Nice to see you again .
__label__sadness	Yes . I had a bad traffic accident.Look , my car looks like a squashed coke can .
__label__joy	thanks . This is so exciting . Sleep tight and sweet dreams !
__label__joy	That sounds interesting . I'll go with you tomorrow evening .
__label__joy	Wow , your English is really fluent now .
__label__joy	Couldn't be better .
__label__joy	Thank you for your compliments . You're welcome to our hotel again .
__label__joy	I was just thinking about someone I went to school with , this boy I was quite friendly with in third grade . We used to hang out together - he lived next door - but then my parents moved and I changed schools and never saw him again .
__label__joy	sure . Good luck , Maria !
__label__joy	I love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce . Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts . Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger ! Mmm ! Mmm ! It ’ s almost lunchtime . I would die for a plate of stir fry right now !
__label__joy	We'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square !
__label__joy	It looks nice .
__label__surprise	Really ? So your city does have some old history after all .
__label__joy	Susan , I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend .
__label__joy	now we get along very well . It makes me feel that I'm someone special .
__label__joy	She is quite young and her hair is blond .
__label__joy	Well then , I'll keep you in the loop . Thank you for your help today .
__label__joy	Thanks . Does the bar have a signature drink ?
__label__joy	Got it . Thanks for calling . Bye .
__label__joy	Hello ! Let me introduce myself . My name is Nancy .
__label__surprise	Why ? You ’ re not satisfied anymore ?
__label__joy	All in all , it will never lose its appeal .
__label__anger	I'm mad ! I said now ! Turn off the TV , and do it now .
__label__joy	Wow ! It's a fruit sculpture ! Your chef is a real artist !
__label__joy	You can see many cows and horses there . lf you are brave enough , you can try horseback riding . it is fun .
__label__anger	Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before .
__label__anger	His name is not fat boy ! You can be so rude sometimes .
__label__joy	Yeah . It's so nice of you to comfort me .
__label__sadness	Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout .
__label__disgust	What a nuisance !
__label__sadness	I ’ m sorry , Jim .
__label__joy	No problem . Wait for a moment .
__label__joy	Great , I love hot food too .
__label__joy	Haha . Wish you good luck .
__label__joy	They are so beautiful . I love them , and I love you too .
__label__joy	Good idea !
__label__joy	And the cover is great ! The colors are brilliant !
__label__joy	Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together .
__label__joy	When is your vacation going to start ?
__label__joy	Good news ! I ’ ll be glad to . When do you need it ?
__label__joy	So , you're going to have a really nice vacation .
__label__disgust	My God ! Why did you bring me here ? I hate the taste of coffee .
__label__anger	This is unfair .
__label__joy	Me ! Me !
__label__joy	Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest .
__label__surprise	All-right guy ? All right . Let's talk about something else instead .
__label__joy	That sounds good , Fred !
__label__anger	It costs more than you think to run a car---especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
__label__joy	Fine , thanks . I am Wang Lin .
__label__joy	I see . Thank you very much .
__label__surprise	With snow in Kunming ? That's crazy !
__label__joy	I'm doing business through Internet now .
__label__joy	Oh , yes !
__label__joy	We can buy the popcorn before entering the cinema .
__label__joy	Thank you , Steve . You're always so encouraging .
__label__joy	Much better today .
__label__joy	No , thanks a lot . I'll try it myself .
__label__sadness	The problem is that many poor people might suffer .
__label__joy	Thank you for coming to see me off .
__label__anger	I wasn't aware that I had to go to court .
__label__surprise	The bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless !
__label__joy	Thank you , bye .
__label__anger	Gosh , another stop.It seems the cars ahead of us have to stop every two minutes , It's no quicker than a bus .
__label__anger	Absolutely not ! I'm not a thief .
__label__sadness	But I always feel disappointed . I have many problems with English learning .
__label__sadness	I just lost my job . My boss just told me .
__label__joy	Cindy , I heard you got into that university . Congratulations !
__label__anger	Hey . Why did you take that money ? You are such a cheater ! I should send you to jail !
__label__joy	See you .
__label__surprise	My goodness.She is thirty seconds faster than the world records in five thousand meters race .
__label__surprise	Really ? I think you ’ ll love it .
__label__joy	Sure . The fitting room is on your right .
__label__anger	Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .
__label__sadness	Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't see the stop sign at the corner . I didn't mean it .
__label__joy	I admire plum blossoms very much . It seems that only it can blossom in the cold winter .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry . But at least we know which bus to catch to get back where we started .
__label__surprise	Wow .
__label__disgust	Maybe he's abnormal .
__label__joy	I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all .
__label__joy	Is everything ready now ?
__label__joy	Yes , I think you'll be very satisfied with that one .
__label__joy	Nice to see you too , Mr . Brown . Won ’ t you sit down ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__anger	So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work .
__label__anger	I really hope that you didn't expect me to pay you for this .
__label__joy	Oh , good .
__label__joy	Maybe we can meet again sometime ?
__label__joy	No . Thanks for reminding me .
__label__joy	How do you like this dress ?
__label__joy	Here's to you , Mary !
__label__anger	It ’ s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight .
__label__joy	Be sure to blow out all the candles in one puff .
__label__joy	Think of the big face down the eve , hmm .
__label__joy	You are married to a foreigner , aren't you ? So what's it like ?
__label__joy	Look at the candy bar over there . It is so colorful and tasty .
__label__disgust	Ur , it stinks !
__label__joy	Sure , what time will you like to depart ?
__label__anger	This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it .
__label__joy	Yes , we got wet through . But we still enjoyed ourselves .
__label__joy	Wonderful ! How much is the ticket ?
__label__joy	Great ! I would like to see cute pandas , too .
__label__joy	Oh , fine . Hey , why don ’ t we grab a bite to eat and do some catching up ?
__label__anger	The washing machine isn't working again .
__label__anger	I just discovered that I owe $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered .
__label__joy	Please type the amount you would like to withdraw . Thank you , you want to transfer 10000 USD to the World Wildlife Foundation . If this is correct please press 1 .
__label__joy	Ok , where and when should I meet you ?
__label__joy	That must be a very interesting job .
__label__joy	Fine , they are colorful and tasty .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__joy	Why haven't I thought of this skill ?
__label__joy	Thank you for hiring me . See you then . Bye .
__label__anger	Because I have given him up as a bad job . Our relation has been over .
__label__sadness	I've just been a little depressed lately .
__label__joy	I'm crazy about it.It makes me very excited .
__label__surprise	Oh , no ! Why ? I was looking forward to seeing you at my new place .
__label__joy	It's my pleasure , what can I do for you ?
__label__joy	Thank you , see you then .
__label__joy	Thanks , Pam . You're my lifesaver .
__label__surprise	You are kidding . What happened ?
__label__joy	It's beautiful .
__label__joy	Congratulations ! That ’ s wonderful . I bet both of you are quite happy .
__label__anger	Well , I hate to disturb you , but I really can't stand it any more . Can you change my room for me ? It's too noisy . I was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . It was too much for me .
__label__joy	I would greatly appreciate that .
__label__joy	That ’ s the way to go .
__label__joy	Happy anniversary , sweetheart !
__label__joy	Thanks for doing such a good job .
__label__joy	That's a good idea.What ' s on ?
__label__joy	Okay , You are such a good talker .
__label__joy	Dark blue .
__label__joy	Nice to meet you ! My name is Grace Williams .
__label__joy	Every chance I get . On weekends I ski all day long . Sometimes I even ski at night .
__label__joy	Not just a thoughtful granddad , but a generous one too .
__label__joy	Oh , Melanie , you are a life saver , thank you !
__label__joy	It looks nice . And it's not expensive .
__label__joy	Oh , do you ? Good .
__label__joy	I'm sure you'll enjoy your workout , sir . Everyone seems to like the swim stations .
__label__joy	Your office looks different with a computer . By the way , is it difficult to use a computer ?
__label__joy	Cool ! I ’ Ve always wanted to do something like that ! Have you learned anything useful ?
__label__joy	I'll be leaving on the fifth of August for the vacation
__label__anger	Come on ! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
__label__joy	No , thanks .
__label__anger	Don ’ t do this ! Don ’ t do that ! You mustn ’ t do this ! You can ’ t do that !
__label__joy	Oh , Where is that ?
__label__joy	Oh yeah , it was great ! He took me to an Italian restaurant and we had an amazing conversation . I told him about how many kids I want , and how my parents will be so excited to meet him .
__label__surprise	I have to go to court ?
__label__surprise	What ? Why ?
__label__joy	I'm back . My bid on the Buddha is still the highest !
__label__sadness	Oh , er ... sorry that's because we didn't have time to clean it .
__label__joy	How beautiful they are ! Thank you so much .
__label__surprise	No ! Are you kidding me ?
__label__joy	Ok . Take care . Have a nice journey .
__label__joy	You're welcome . Have a nice day !
__label__joy	Happy birthday , John . Many happy returns of the day !
__label__joy	Let's call it a day then.Good - bye , everyone .
__label__joy	See you .
__label__joy	Your tree looks beautiful . Do you decorate it this way every year ?
__label__joy	yes , but I bought it when it was on sale , 50 % off the original price . OK , what do you think ?
__label__anger	A warrant for what ?
__label__joy	Thanks a lot . And I believe I'll have a good time working with you .
__label__joy	Well , let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year .
__label__joy	Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know .
__label__fear	He just stays in the kitchen and watches you . Before the Chinese New Year , the kitchen god tells his boss whether you were good or bad this year . Just like Lester does !
__label__joy	we really were lucky . We got the last available table for two---and we didn't even have a reservation ! Did you see the long lines behind us ?
__label__joy	Me too . So , do you like the course ?
__label__joy	It looks like you all had a nice time .
__label__joy	Thank you very much . Mr . George . As a newcomer , I understand that you have your consideration and I am satisfied with the raise .
__label__joy	No problem . You can try this kind of gel which can prevent freckle , the effect will be better if you use this powder foundation applied with it .
__label__joy	Do you want to go shopping with me ?
__label__sadness	I ’ m terribly sorry . May I have your order again ? I'll get it right away .
__label__joy	Your search on this project has been excellent .
__label__anger	Gordon , you're ever so late .
__label__joy	Don't mention it .
__label__joy	He is tall and slim , fair-haired .
__label__joy	I am not good at it by any means . Give me some advice .
__label__anger	Sorry isn ’ t good enough ! What can you do to help me ?
__label__joy	Fantastic ! how was that ?
__label__joy	That's a wonderful choice .
__label__joy	It's been nice talking to you .
__label__joy	No problem , anytime .
__label__joy	Yes . I like the dress . It must be the latest fashion . Look , the hem has lowered , and the waist narrowed .
__label__joy	I ’ m flattered , but really anyone else could do it .
__label__fear	Watch out , Patrick !
__label__joy	I like girls who like to have fun , and aren't too serious .
__label__joy	OK , I'll find the time to relax soon .
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome . It was good seeing you again .
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	It was terrific . I really enjoyed it .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	That was a great dinner . I didn't know that you knew how yo cook .
__label__surprise	Barbara !
__label__surprise	I couldn ’ t believe it , either .
__label__joy	Bobby ! Come here , look what I got you !
__label__joy	Lamb and beef . It will get even tastier when we add the veggies !
__label__joy	No problem , sir .
__label__sadness	Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t know .
__label__joy	Not everyone . But a lot of people do , especially the young . It's a fine place to spend an evening with friends or to make some new friends .
__label__joy	You can take a bird-eye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain .
__label__joy	Oh , how wonderful !
__label__joy	Thank you . This is my first time to come to a Chinese restaurant . Could you tell me the different features of Chinese food ?
__label__joy	Did you have the watch before getting the ring ?
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	Thank you for your help .
__label__joy	That will be a good one ! Anything else ?
__label__surprise	really ? I didn't know that would be possible .
__label__anger	Isn't there anything that sounds fishy ?
__label__joy	Mary , today is a great day for you .
__label__joy	Yeah of course ! Although , don ’ t you ever wonder what “ could have been ” ?
__label__joy	OK .
__label__joy	Now you're talking .
__label__joy	It's better for cooking Chinese food . Well , what do you think ?
__label__joy	Mmm . That's what I thought too . I really liked the car chase , and the opening credit sequence was very exciting . And I always enjoy watching Pierce Brosnan .
__label__joy	Good . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Monica to our company and introduce her to her department and colleagues . For all of you , we hired Monica because she is a very professional accountant and we are very happy to have her in the finance department . She has lots of working experiences as an accountant and I am sure everybody in the department can benefit from this .
__label__joy	Hello ! I'm Penny , I moved here just now .
__label__surprise	Goodness me ! So many choices ! I think I'll have a cappuccino please .
__label__joy	The color and style are consistent with the sample . Great !
__label__joy	Here you are , sir . Pay the cashier at the door .
__label__joy	This will work out well . I'm getting hungry just thinking about it .
__label__joy	I love the beautiful lawn . What a great front entryway !
__label__joy	This is your first Christmas in the US . Here is the gift for you .
__label__anger	A man robbed me today .
__label__joy	Well , as you know I was in Thailand last month , and I took a cooking class ! So I prepared some of my favorite dishes .
__label__joy	Yes . I find my heart is now rising and falling like waves , all sorts of feelings welling up in my heart .
__label__joy	See this one that looks like a tower ? It ’ s called the rook . The one with the tall hat is called the bishop . See this little horsey ? This is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it .
__label__joy	It's a pity that I'm too busy to see you off tomorrow .
__label__joy	Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , but I can't .
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__joy	Honey , I've got good news for you .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__surprise	You must be joking !
__label__anger	I dare you to say that again .
__label__joy	I think it is going to be the same as today . Clear and sunny .
__label__joy	What a nice dress , Jean.You look marvelous !
__label__joy	Scientists have found a second solar system in the universe .
__label__surprise	Is that true ? But anyhow , it's none of our business , isn't it ?
__label__joy	That ’ s it . I think we ’ re one block beyond .
__label__surprise	Are you nuts ! I ’ m not going to run a red light !
__label__joy	Yeah , it's really unforgettable . Thank you for making me happy all these years .
__label__surprise	Really ? What did you get one for ?
__label__surprise	really ? I haven't heard of it .
__label__joy	That ’ s good . Thanks .
__label__joy	Congratulations . How is your wife doing ?
__label__joy	In June .
__label__joy	Hopefully , that will keep everyone happy .
__label__joy	What's that ?
__label__joy	I couldn't agree more .
__label__joy	Let's see.How do you feel about playing bridge ?
__label__joy	That would be great . Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That's assuming you don't mind if I call you sometime .
__label__joy	Hi ! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection .
__label__joy	Gate 29C . Have a nice flight .
__label__surprise	Hello , Zhang lin ! Fancy meeting you here !
__label__joy	Let's go to watch an NBA game tonight , shall we ?
__label__joy	You bet it !
__label__sadness	He ’ s the love of my life ! I ’ Ve really messed this up .
__label__joy	That's right
__label__joy	Yeah , oh my god ! It's still there . We have our first date right on there .
__label__joy	So it's time to buy your very first car ! Wow , that's exciting !
__label__joy	Thank you . Do you need something else ?
__label__joy	Sounds interesting ! That must be very convenient .
__label__surprise	I can believe it , and I am very excited about it .
__label__joy	Daniel loves the beach very much !
__label__joy	Hey , thanks , mum .
__label__sadness	Look ! I bought these shoes only three weeks ago and there is a hole in them already .
__label__joy	There ’ s no rush . You can see him tomorrow . I ’ Ve told him about you . He promised to give you the job .
__label__joy	Let's go out and have a look .
__label__joy	Thank you . It is very kind of you .
__label__joy	Yes , it's not like what the radio said at all .
__label__joy	Now , the effort pays off . You have accomplished something .
__label__anger	Ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses !
__label__surprise	Look , how grand magnificent the Tiananmen Gate tour is !
__label__joy	I really feel like having a big juicy steak !
__label__joy	Yes , we have a very pleasant time . Thank you for being so nice for us .
__label__joy	Home at last . Tonight we have a lot of homework though .
__label__joy	Why not go again to celebrate our one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant .
__label__anger	Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine .
__label__joy	Thanks !
__label__sadness	Maybe ... but I don't think so .
__label__joy	Great , I just hope I qualify ! Could you tell me some more ? Can I use the money to buy the car from anywhere ?
__label__joy	Thanks for everything .
__label__joy	Nice day , isn't it ?
__label__joy	I really enjoy the beach in the summer .
__label__joy	Yeah , I will . See you then !
__label__joy	This is a very nice place . How long have you been living here now ?
__label__joy	Yes , I'd like to . It's my honor . Let's pick a song .
__label__sadness	I understand , and I am very sorry .
__label__joy	That'll be fine . Thanks .
__label__joy	Mendy ? Are you sure ? I love her songs !
__label__anger	How dare you ! ( starts to walk off )
__label__joy	I love that they put a wine storage area in the kitchen .
__label__joy	Right .
__label__joy	So , you'll be at my birthday party on Friday ?
__label__sadness	I just got off the phone with my boyfriend . He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing . It ’ s so hard to talk to him at times .
__label__joy	It's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice .
__label__surprise	I think I forgot to send it in !
__label__surprise	really ? I ’ m very surprised . He doesn ’ t look like a guy who ’ d ever do that sort of thing , right ?
__label__joy	That's all right .
__label__joy	Well , that's easy . Walk up to him and kiss him .
__label__joy	That sounds really tasty .
__label__joy	No . The company pays for everything . Doesn't this sound very attractive ? This is why our company can always get the best employees !
__label__surprise	What are you talking about ? How does it exploit people ?
__label__joy	me , too . Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ?
__label__joy	I can hardly wait !
__label__joy	Very good . Could you deliver it to this address ?
__label__surprise	Angry ? Why would I be ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Exactly . We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts . If you want to learn and play a little , you're welcome to join us .
__label__joy	Okay , I'll give you a ring next week .
__label__joy	Sure , he's ready to be friendly with anyone .
__label__joy	Thank you for calling.Goodbye .
__label__joy	Thanks for the offer , but I think I've got it . Hopefully , I won't get lost again on my way there !
__label__joy	Yes . I thought it was excellent . Didn't you ?
__label__joy	You too . I hope to see you soon.Goodbye .
__label__joy	Wonderful .
__label__joy	Oh , I didn't think of that . Well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China . Plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions .
__label__joy	I've just visited your showroom . You surely get a lot of fancy bedsheets . I like them very much .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , sir.The price is fixed .
__label__joy	Oh , you didn ’ t have to ...
__label__joy	It's called love is blind , I think .
__label__joy	A silk scarf . I love it . Thank you very much . My lovely son .
__label__joy	Hello . I ’ m calling about the one bedroom in Lincoln Park . Could I take a look at it ? Yes . Tonight at six is fine . Thanks .
__label__joy	Hearing you say that is a big reward for us . And here is the receipt .
__label__joy	Thank you for hiring me . I'm very proud to be employed by your firm .
__label__joy	My first grandchild .
__label__anger	Forget it ! It was a bitter pill for me to swallow .
__label__joy	Good for you ! You ’ Ve got new curtains too . That ’ s a very nice shade of blue . This sofa is very comfortable . I could sit on it all day !
__label__anger	yes , they were horrible . We had to wear green every day !
__label__joy	Yes , of course .
__label__surprise	You saw a ghost ? When ?
__label__sadness	I see .
__label__surprise	How strange ! Our little emperor now asks to help out with shopping .
__label__surprise	Until college ?
__label__joy	Let's go to the food stall . There's a good one just around the corner .
__label__joy	I wouldn ’ t be able to make it without your help .
__label__joy	This broth is wonderful . What's in it ?
__label__sadness	I am sorry , sir . We are booked until 9:10 .
__label__joy	Wow , Good for you.It sounds like a lot of work . I'm proud of you ! Is this the right building ?
__label__joy	Welcome to our show ! Today , I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich ! Are you ready ? Let ’ s get started !
__label__joy	Certainly . Let's put the suitcase in the boot .
__label__joy	Did you see his last dive .
__label__joy	Good for you , keep it up .
__label__joy	It's super .
__label__joy	That smells great . I'll take one bottle , please .
__label__joy	( In the club ) Look at those people in the dance floor , they are so crazy .
__label__surprise	Are you joking ? Get the supplier on the line now ! They have to assume the costs of this mess !
__label__joy	Okay , I think that will be all for me today .
__label__joy	Thank you , bye !
__label__fear	I'm terribly nervous .
__label__anger	I also hate having to stand at a bus stop in all kinds of weather .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry sir , this flight has been cancelled due to some mechanical problems .
__label__surprise	oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ?
__label__joy	No problem , sir .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Good.You really know how to enjoy yourself .
__label__anger	What a nuisance !
__label__joy	Thanks , goodbye .
__label__joy	Yes , come on , and we will have fun .
__label__joy	It ’ s my pleasure . Would you like another glass of champagne ?
__label__joy	I would really appreciate that , thanks .
__label__joy	He's a hero in our town .
__label__sadness	I'm really sorry . I'll face the music .
__label__joy	Okay , here's a new one for you .
__label__joy	Sounds fun . Anyone I know ?
__label__joy	Yes , It's only 8 forty . Thanks so much !
__label__joy	I got the movie when it came out on DVD , do you want to come over ?
__label__joy	Um , let me see . Hmm . This antique tea set here is gorgeous .
__label__joy	Not a bad idea !
__label__joy	That's a good choice . How do you want to pay for it ?
__label__surprise	I don't understand why I can't just pay you .
__label__joy	Good idea . I was thinking the same myself .
__label__joy	Oh , thanks . You know , I know little about this , so please tell me something that I should pay more attention to when I do washing .
__label__surprise	Well , imagine that ! How old are you ?
__label__joy	It certainly has been a pleasure seeing you again and renewing old memories .
__label__surprise	What ? I thought you liked Patricia .
__label__surprise	Really ? That sounds interesting !
__label__joy	I'll do that.Thank you.Have a safe trip home .
__label__anger	why ere you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn ’ t it ?
__label__joy	I appreciate your kindness .
__label__joy	Don't mention it . I am pleased to help you .
__label__joy	Good . Now just complete this form .
__label__joy	Sure . Let ’ s go .
__label__joy	See you .
__label__joy	Maybe I can meet you at the club and we can play tennis together .
__label__joy	But this time I ’ m going to stick to it . I really mean it ! Trust me , Carol , I ’ m going to be a new man in one year ’ s time !
__label__joy	They have a good variety of vegetable-based dishes like talak panter , vegetable samosas or daal .
__label__joy	Here is to our friendship and health !
__label__surprise	Really ? There aren't many left now .
__label__joy	Yes , of course . This is a really wonderful party with interesting people and great food .
__label__joy	I will . Merry Christmas .
__label__fear	Umm . I think my water just broke ! Get me to a hospital !
__label__joy	She is beautiful .
__label__joy	cooking makes me feel relaxed . So , what are we cooking ?
__label__joy	Great ! I will apply for a credit card when I go to the bank later .
__label__joy	That ’ s a good way to think about it .
__label__joy	Oh , don't mention it .
__label__joy	Good news !
__label__joy	This party is going to have a DJ , food , and drinks .
__label__joy	That's great . Let's begin as soon as possible .
__label__joy	How do you do , Mr.Smith ? This is Lili . I'm calling to thank you for the wonderful dinner we had yesterday . I enjoyed it very much .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__anger	Oh , this one is perfect .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Am I too abrupt ? Did I scare you ? Or you don't want ...
__label__joy	So we must get you to the hotel as soon as possible . I hope to see you refreshed and revitalized tomorrow morning , as we are going to visit the Great Wall .
__label__anger	Oh , you men ! You are all the same .
__label__anger	Didn't I tell you ? It's over !
__label__surprise	His residence ? You mean the whole palace ?
__label__joy	Thank you . It's a pleasure to meet you .
__label__sadness	It ’ s a pity we can ’ t afford a house . A garden would be so nice .
__label__sadness	Four times . I'm totally prepared . Oh , no ! I forgot to take off my nail polish ! And I have to be there in 15 minutes ! That's it . I blew it .
__label__joy	Ok , on that day , boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate in return .
__label__joy	I am so happy . I want to drink a cup of champagne .
__label__sadness	Working at weekend is something I hate to do most .
__label__joy	A growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over China .
__label__joy	I bought some chow mein at the cafeteria . It tasted great .
__label__joy	I ’ m sure that will be very popular .. OK , let ’ s think about how we can put these ideas into practice .
__label__joy	Thank you for repairing it .
__label__anger	It is stupid to say so .
__label__joy	Hi . My name is Dolma .
__label__fear	This sucks . I hate buying lingerie . Okay , just find something and get out of here . Alright , these are fine . Oh , no , don ’ t come over here , don ’ t come over here .
__label__joy	Oh , ISEE . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors .
__label__surprise	Really ? Do you like it ?
__label__anger	That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch .
__label__joy	Let's go . It sounds interesting .
__label__joy	I love you , too .
__label__joy	Yoga ? It sounds interesting .
__label__joy	Great .
__label__joy	It feels good .
__label__joy	I think I'm in love .
__label__joy	that looks lovely . Just one more thing---you need a pair of earrings .
__label__surprise	Did I ? Well , anyway , you will get your raise when the economy starts picking up .
__label__joy	You are right , Mary's father is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement , costs , etc . I think he must spend much money .
__label__disgust	Hong Kong again . I would like to go somewhere different for a change .
__label__joy	That ’ s gorgeous ! Do they have it in a size 8 ?
__label__fear	I am happy that you like the house . We should write down what we like so that we can remember it .
__label__joy	Sounds good to me . The guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him .
__label__joy	No regrets .
__label__joy	That's true . Having a very serious boyfriend or girlfriend can be boring .
__label__joy	Yeah , it sure would .
__label__joy	Cool !
__label__joy	Haven't you heard that your novel has won The Nobel Prize ?
__label__joy	OK . Let's disco .
__label__sadness	Silly me .
__label__surprise	Great ! Work is really busy now , but it's fun .
__label__joy	Well , it was definitely worth all the time .
__label__joy	Your tent and enough food and water .
__label__disgust	I get antsy not because you praise a guy , but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him .
__label__joy	Yes , I ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction .
__label__joy	Thank you very much . That ’ s very kind .
__label__joy	So boring ! Shall we go out for a picnic with my friends ?
__label__joy	No . This is my first time to buy some . You can see that its historical price data is rising now .
__label__joy	Not much . I've got enough city life in Beijing .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Good idea . We should also hold a series of presentations . We could have presentations on the history of the university , the courses we offer , and our links with other universities .
__label__joy	Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable !
__label__joy	That sounds like fun . Would you mind some company ?
__label__joy	Thanks . By the way , tell your wife she throws a great party .
__label__joy	Sure . I usually have my lunch here . The food is tasty and they offer a big variety .
__label__joy	I mean look at all these magnificent tall buildings around us .
__label__joy	What a beautiful day !
__label__joy	There.It looks great , don ’ t you think ? I ’ m going to get these jeans as well . I need a new pair . I ‘ m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter .
__label__anger	What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking .
__label__joy	Well then , we are all straight . Have a good day and thanks for bringing that to my attention .
__label__joy	I like your black clothes and your fangs are cool .
__label__joy	Cool ! They're big ! What have you got in there ?
__label__joy	Who is your favorite author ?
__label__joy	What are we waiting for ? Come on !
__label__joy	Oh , hi , Lee . You look great .
__label__joy	Thank you for such a lovely evening ! The food was amazing , and I had a great time .
__label__joy	Good . Tonight 8 o'clock .
__label__joy	Where was this picture taken ?
__label__joy	Congratulations ! Susan . I ’ m so happy for you .
__label__joy	thanks . Charlie !
__label__sadness	I'm afraid that's the best we can do .
__label__joy	That ’ s good . Will you tell me the details ?
__label__joy	That's very nice of you .
__label__sadness	Well , let me call the shoe department to see if they ’ Ve found a passport . Sorry , your passport hasn't turned up there either .
__label__joy	Yes , it has great curb appeal .
__label__joy	Yes . The price has been reduced by 50 % . It ’ s a real bargain .
__label__surprise	Oh , no ! Not again .
__label__joy	No , thank you , Mrs . Carter . I'm fine for now .
__label__joy	No , I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just want to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It's casual , yet sophisticated .
__label__joy	That's our pleasure . Mr . Ross , your visit leaves gorgeous memory here . And I hope Mr.Halmiton , the president of your company can also have the chance to visit our company soon . Remember me to him , please .
__label__sadness	Oh , I'm sorry . should have been 2135-3668 , not 3678 . I've given you a wrong number .
__label__joy	I ’ Ve made up my mind not to be beaten again .
__label__anger	How do you know that I didn ’ t try ? I just couldn ’ t manage it .
__label__joy	What a nice day ! Why don't we go for an outing ?
__label__anger	But I don ’ t like them ! It ’ s not fair !
__label__joy	He is tall and slim , fair-haired .
__label__joy	Good luck on your test tomorrow . We'll be crossing our fingers for you !
__label__joy	That ’ s fantastic . Thank you .
__label__joy	Yes , of course . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	That does look easy . I think I'll make some tonight .
__label__joy	This is interesting , Ms.Parker .
__label__joy	really ? That's fantastic ! Will you get a chance to do any writing ?
__label__joy	Yes . Just think the blue sky , sunshine , mouth-watering food , centuries-old castles - -
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	Yeah . I've seen pictures of the crowds !
__label__joy	Oh , I see . I think I prefer a natural one .
__label__surprise	Wow ! That's cool . So , let me give you some details about the deck I want .
__label__joy	I see , thank you very much !
__label__joy	Right !
__label__joy	Thank you ! Guess how much it costs .
__label__joy	that's a good idea . Wish you a great vacation !
__label__joy	Yes .
__label__joy	Everybody , I'd like to propose a toast to Mary Johnson , Teacher of the Year . She worked hard all year . She really deserved the honor .
__label__surprise	Oh , they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately .
__label__joy	That's great !
__label__joy	Yes , Mr . Emory . Thank you .
__label__disgust	Oh , dear . That ’ s terrible . Not at all what I expected .
__label__joy	Good , I am sure it will work if you can persist .
__label__joy	Well , trust me . The quality is fantastic .
__label__anger	There was no reason for them to arrest me .
__label__joy	It surely is .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	Yes . We enjoyed ourselves very much . Have you traveled much , Luke ?
__label__joy	I'm glad we're meeting today . Thank you .
__label__joy	Ok . I'll call you back after I'm done .
__label__joy	I'm waiting for our President to lower the gas prices .
__label__surprise	What ? Cars ? Are you serious ?
__label__surprise	Really ? That ’ s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ?
__label__joy	Oh , I must be going now ; it was nice talking with you .
__label__joy	Would you prefer to come in in the morning or the afternoon ?
__label__disgust	I feel the same way .
__label__joy	Thanks for telling me .
__label__joy	Absolutely ! If you come to our class , I am sure you will like him .
__label__joy	OK .
__label__joy	Let's play some music ! I feel like dancing .
__label__surprise	Really ? I think you see more traveling by train .
__label__joy	You bet . This is the nicest room in the district . You know what , I just had all the walls repainted last month .
__label__joy	May I have a look at that china tea set ? It is extremely beautiful .
__label__joy	Yes , actually almost half of all the countries over the world . I love traveling places .
__label__surprise	Get out of here ! I didn ’ t even know they were dating !
__label__joy	Ooh , that's my favorite . Maybe I'll have a small slice .
__label__joy	yes , it is so . i love songs that take me to some places i have not been or have been for a long time . it is fun and exciting .
__label__joy	Hey , you wanna see a movie tomorrow ?
__label__joy	I guess you could say that . Eating fruit and vegetables helps keep you healthy . I've lost 5 pounds and I feel great !
__label__joy	Thank you , mom . I love you so much !
__label__joy	I really appreciate your help .
__label__surprise	Recliner ? In my beautifully decorated living room ? I don ’ t think so !
__label__joy	Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb .
__label__joy	Haha , that's definitely a cheesy movie too . Did you watch it over and over again ?
__label__surprise	What a lovely dog ! How did you know I love things like this ?
__label__sadness	I'm sorry . I can't . What does the note say .
__label__surprise	Oh really ? What did you do ?
__label__joy	No , thank you .
__label__joy	that's great , that's good for a positive work environment and helps motivate employees . I wish my boss was like that .
__label__anger	Great , because I am really mad at William . I mean , what kind of an idiot wouldn't be able to appreciate a smart , beautiful woman like me ? Anybody who would be friends with that guy has to be really dumb .
__label__surprise	Really ? Ugh ... Is there any difference ?
__label__joy	It was so kind of you .
__label__joy	Certainly . Let me see . Oh , it's on that self .
__label__joy	Can you imagine she's over forty ?
__label__joy	Thank you . Goodbye .
__label__joy	I've heard the weather here is ideal , just like spring most of the year .
__label__joy	That's a good idea .
__label__joy	Come on . I stand behind you .
__label__joy	Thank you . He ’ s very lucky indeed .
__label__joy	Yeah , sounds like fun . I can wear my new pink bikini .
__label__joy	Yeah , I want the note .
__label__joy	I can just use my beach towel . I love lazing around in the sun .
__label__anger	You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ’ t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study .
__label__joy	Tuna sounds good today .
__label__joy	Seriously , I am so excited .
__label__joy	Sounds like a good plan . What do you want to see ?
__label__joy	I couldn't help laughing , either .
__label__joy	OK . Then I will clean the table .
__label__disgust	I am totally fed up with my boss . He has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments . This time I am really going to report him for sexual harassment .
__label__joy	You are welcome . I am very impressed by your capability .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	I'm very happy to meet you . You're from the United States , aren't you ?
__label__anger	You !
__label__joy	Very interesting . But I'm afraid we'd better do something else . Hey , look ! There is a huge lantern there . Let's get close to it .
__label__joy	All right . Let me prepare the supper .
__label__sadness	I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw .
__label__joy	Thanks . You have a good one , too .
__label__joy	I ’ m happy to hear you say that .
__label__fear	Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick !
__label__joy	Thank you , you are very kind !
__label__surprise	Really ? I know you are very concerned about the environment . You were a member of the pressure group Greenpeace , weren ’ t you ?
__label__joy	Actually , we bought the ring together after I got the watch .
__label__joy	Good morning , John !
__label__joy	I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__joy	I'm getting by OK . I heard MicroPower was going to make Zina president of their new invoking Internet division .
__label__joy	Sounds good .
__label__joy	Is it nice ?
__label__joy	Yes , sir . I ’ ll get them for you right away . Would you please sign this bill first ? Thank you , sir .
__label__sadness	worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days .
__label__joy	Yes . If she doesn't believe it , Christmas won't be so exciting to her .
__label__joy	Thanks for your trust . Owing to my colleagues ' help , I've successfully completed my task .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__anger	Ah ! No ! Damn it !
__label__joy	I heard through the grapevine that your getting married .
__label__joy	Sure , what time ?
__label__joy	Ok , thank you .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable !
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	That ’ s it ? Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	We went to the coast . It's really a nice place for camping , really good time around the fire singing and dancing .
__label__sadness	I am sorry . That table has been booked .
__label__joy	It's my pleasure . Well , then , see you tomorrow .
__label__joy	I think so , you know there is a great deal of opportunity for business there .
__label__joy	Yes , their new album just came out last week . It is number one on the billboard .
__label__joy	How about samba ?
__label__joy	I think I'll go and get my food there .
__label__sadness	Well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . .
__label__joy	I can imagine ! I tend to faint when I see blood , so I think I won ’ t be taking up a course like that anytime soon !
__label__joy	Wow , that sounds pretty safe . So how do you pay ? Do you need a credit card ?
__label__joy	Sure , what ’ s up ?
__label__anger	I really don't know how to break this to you , but it ’ s eating me alive !
__label__joy	I am glad you like it .
__label__joy	Ok . Take the Underground ( the Circle line ) to High Street Kensington . Make sure you take the High Street Kensington exit .
__label__joy	It isn't your fault . No one will blame you .
__label__joy	It seems a good way .
__label__joy	It sure is.The Grand Canyon is truly masterpiece . No man could ever make anything like this .
__label__joy	Come here ; let me introduce some friends to you .
__label__joy	Good idea .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	And humility . I would have liked to meet him personally .
__label__joy	I'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness , good health and continued success . I've asked the Fairy Flowers to send you a bunch of flowers . I hope you'll like them .
__label__joy	She'll be very happy with this . And how do you plan to pay for it ?
__label__joy	Ha ha , come on ! Well , I ’ Ve been watching what I eat , and working out three times a week . By the way , I heard your son recently graduated !
__label__anger	There's the difference , your wife made it ! I have to make my own lunch !
__label__joy	Maybe you are right .
__label__joy	How about Joining our summer camp next week ?
__label__joy	Come on in.Let me show you the house.Isn ' t it something ? Spacious , bright and clean.And the walls were newly painted.Have you ever seen such a nice house ?
__label__sadness	I'm sorry . I've lost my tags and receipt . How can I do about it ?
__label__surprise	I can't believe it !
__label__joy	Gucci , I have an idea . Do you want to see this movie together ?
__label__joy	So they say .
__label__sadness	I cut it on that blade .
__label__anger	She ’ s your sister.What she asked was only duck soup for you.Why can ’ t you be good to her ?
__label__joy	That ’ s not a bad idea . I brought many plenty of books and things back with me last summer . That would be great resource material . Now if I can only remember where I put them .
__label__joy	Perfect . It really hits the spot .
__label__sadness	Oh , really ? Just a moment ... You paid with a ten-dollar note and I gave you ... Oh , sorry , here's a five left . I'm terribly sorry .
__label__joy	Sure . If we can get an appointment with someone to do the floors , we should probably be able to have the furniture in here after a week or so . I can get all the carpet out this weekend .
__label__joy	Yes , I liked it , too . It was exciting , but not over the top . Do you know what I mean ?
__label__joy	Thanks mom !
__label__joy	Yes . I've dreamed a thousand times that I could lie down here to relax .
__label__surprise	Really ? I have been told , by another bank , that it makes it difficult if you want to investigate a company which is registered outside China .
__label__joy	Okay , it sounds good .
__label__surprise	Come again ? What are you talking about ? Aren't we on the same team now ?
__label__joy	Thanks a million .
__label__joy	I'm an engineer at IBM .
__label__joy	That's a lucky fruit called hong zat ! People say that if you eat them , you will have your first son very soon !
__label__joy	Thank you for your help .
__label__joy	OK , we will choose it .
__label__joy	Yes . Thank you .
__label__joy	Great , I like the idea of trying some new food .
__label__joy	This is delicious ! The ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice taste !
__label__joy	I said it's a lovely day . Why don't we go for a walk ?
__label__joy	We've been looking forward to your visit . It is a great pleasure for us to have you as our guest . It is always more convenient to discuss things face to face .
__label__joy	Tango is my favorite . Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot . ( the music has stopped )
__label__sadness	Wait a minute . I am really sorry but I can't find it now .
__label__surprise	Oh , how were you saved finally ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	You're right . Thank you for the advice .
__label__joy	We have a really interesting project coming up . Would you want to join us on it ?
__label__joy	Well , good for you . I hope you can get what you want from the training .
__label__joy	Yeah , I guess it's the same in the UK , I just never paid much attention . See you later !
__label__anger	I was anxious to find out what the sellers had to say about my counter-offer .
__label__joy	Like creating a sepia tone look and some special effects such as fades and dissolves .
__label__joy	Many thanks for your presence .
__label__joy	Don't you notice that Bob has a mole on his face , but Tom does not .
__label__joy	Thank you , I ’ ll pay next then .
__label__joy	What lovely weather !
__label__joy	What an amazing goal !
__label__joy	Yeah , that's a good idea , and you like to cook .
__label__disgust	My hair looks awful .
__label__surprise	Oh , yes .
__label__joy	Oh , great ! I hope I can spend this Spring Festival with you here in Beijing .
__label__joy	Fine . Now complete this form and sign your name at the bottom .

__label__joy	Sure . There you are .
__label__joy	No , that should be it . Thank you !
__label__joy	I'd like to invite you to dinner tonight , do you think have time ?
__label__joy	Exactly !
__label__joy	It ’ s very good . Check in and check out at the reception only took a few minutes . The wait staff is very good . A waiter recommended their baked fish , which tasted wonderful . The hotel was quite full , so I ’ d suggest making a reservation if you intend to go there . The hotel offers a discount at the weekends .
__label__joy	Done . Oh , don't forget to take napkins , disposable plates , cups and picnic blanket .
__label__surprise	are you kidding me ? How could he behave like that ?
__label__joy	Look ! It's amazing . I can't wait to try it out !

__label__joy	I agree . I like guys that can make me laugh .
__label__sadness	Nothing really .
__label__joy	Yes , I do not want to see ur sleeping in the office .
__label__joy	Baltimore defeated Texas by 17 points !
__label__joy	that's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
__label__joy	Yes ! It ’ s very fine meat ! Made it myself ...
__label__joy	Thanks ! I will do that ! When is your birthday ?
__label__surprise	Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ?
__label__surprise	There ’ s movie ? My teacher didn ’ t tell me that !
__label__anger	Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either !
__label__joy	I'll take it . Please wrap it up for me and give me the receipt .
__label__sadness	I did . But they said they won ’ t change them .
__label__joy	No problem , ma ’ am .
__label__joy	Yes . I found a very good job down here .
__label__joy	Yes . I love it , too .
__label__joy	OK . Here's the key . Take care .
__label__surprise	When she told me that she would marry no man but Dick , my heart was almost in my mouth .
__label__joy	Madam , we also welcome you to visit our company . I hope you can also bring your family there to have a look of our company . In this way , we will know each other better .
__label__joy	I ’ m so happy for the family ! They must be very relieved and excited about that .
__label__joy	Isn ’ t it wonderful here ? The kids are enjoying themselves in the swimming pool . I hope it ’ s safe .
__label__disgust	What a bother having to climb storeys home every day .
__label__sadness	I really thought this was our stop .
__label__surprise	But I ordered waffles !
__label__fear	Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me !
__label__joy	Sounds nice . What about classes ?
__label__joy	Yes.Look ! Mary is going to throw the bride bouquet .
__label__joy	You can give it a try ! May be you will succeed .
__label__joy	Beautiful .
__label__joy	Absolutely .
__label__joy	No , your daughter is great .
__label__joy	Woo , your home will beautiful on Christmas .
__label__joy	Where is it ?
__label__surprise	Only three days ?
__label__joy	I agree ! I cried for a week when they broke up .
__label__joy	Certainly . A simple letter from your bank would be quite satisfactory .
__label__joy	I've never seen such good graphics .
__label__sadness	I , ah ... , I got have late .
__label__surprise	Oh yeah , those are from my trip to London . I have a couple of different pence , but in all it won't add up to one pound .
__label__sadness	I understand , sir . I ’ ll bring a doctor ’ s note in tomorrow . I am sorry , Mr . Douglas .
__label__joy	Really ? No , no , I couldn't ! You're too nice !
__label__surprise	Oh , unbelievable . This was too luxurious .
__label__joy	Very well sir . Would you like to have some shirts made also ?
__label__joy	Bye !
__label__surprise	Engaged.Oh , dear ! Could you tell her it's a long-distance call ?
__label__joy	Well , imagine that ! How old are you ?
__label__joy	I expected that something might get broken . That doesn ’ t bother me . That spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ?
__label__joy	Yeah , I already knew that . That could be a good thing .
__label__joy	Oh , that's difficult to say . But I guess I liked Nashville the best .
__label__surprise	I could not and can ’ t make out the reason why she would set her heart on a man like Dick . He plays the field with many girls .
__label__joy	I knew everything would work out for you !
__label__joy	But you agreed to go out with me at last .
__label__joy	You're a good dancer .
__label__joy	Thank you again . I'll keep doing my best .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Not really . Her eyes are blue .
__label__joy	OK , thank you .
__label__joy	Yes , it was quite a long flight . I'm glad to finally be here .
__label__joy	All right , just a quick one .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot for having us . We had a good time .
__label__joy	Can you use the thinning shears on top , too ? My hair is really thick .
__label__joy	My acceptance letter to Yale !
__label__joy	Fine , well just send the form to us and we will let you know as soon as your supplies come in . Have a good day !
__label__joy	Wow ! I ’ m very excited about your ceremony .
__label__joy	Good . How much does it come to ?
__label__joy	Thanks , I'm enough .
__label__joy	Yes , Sunday sounds fine . What time ?
__label__surprise	Really ? How to do that ?
__label__sadness	Tired and stressed . This wedding is giving me a headache .
__label__joy	Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss.Parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
__label__anger	It's no use complaining.If we had got enough money , we wouldn't put up with it !
__label__surprise	you've been promoted ? when did that happen ?
__label__joy	That's more reasonable . I'll take this one .
__label__surprise	Oh no ! That ’ s terrible !
__label__sadness	It is a long story . Basically , she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't .
__label__joy	I bet that Lee wasn't too happy with that !
__label__joy	That ’ s OK .
__label__joy	Don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself .
__label__sadness	If so , I'd better try another store .
__label__joy	The bourbon is 15 dollars plus 10 % service charge . So the total is 16.5 dollars .
__label__joy	How smart of you to book the tickets before hand !
__label__surprise	I didn't know you had a brother .
__label__joy	No i am free , i will be there , what time the thing starting ?
__label__surprise	The weather is so crazy . It rained cats and dogs last night , but cleared up in the morning .
__label__joy	Yes . I'd like to swap some of my peanuts for your chips .
__label__surprise	Are you kidding me ? Becky ? She ’ s a real bitch .
__label__joy	Good news for us . When can you start to work ?
__label__joy	Me too .
__label__joy	Listen to the sound of nature ! It's like music .
__label__joy	I really appreciate your help .
__label__surprise	Really ? Well , thanks for saying so .
__label__surprise	Just two days ago it was 35 . How can it be 60 ?
__label__surprise	Are you kidding ?
__label__joy	That's okay . I like it better that way anyway .
__label__joy	Thanks for coming , it was a real blessed .
__label__surprise	Oh , Mary . You've surprised me !
__label__anger	My hair looks hideous .
__label__joy	I'm proud of you for standing by her . I think you've helped make a big difference in her life .
__label__joy	No , thank you .
__label__joy	Hit ' em high , hit ' em low . Class of ' 93 — let's go !
__label__joy	I've been thinking about this for a while now .
__label__disgust	She keeps spitting on the ground .
__label__joy	Let me know if I can do anything for you .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__sadness	To be honest , I was just dumped .
__label__joy	Oh , that's exciting . What does this guy look like ? Is he hot ?
__label__sadness	What ? That ’ s odd . I ’ m so sorry if I ’ Ve bothered you .
__label__anger	Didn ’ t you tell him you have an appointment ?
__label__joy	You are a candy terminator . Be careful or you'll get a lot of cavities .
__label__joy	I'd love it.Working out is more fun with a friend .
__label__joy	Thank you for your love and care over the years , I appreciate it , mom .
__label__joy	Please go ahead , I am listening .
__label__joy	You look great !
__label__joy	Yes , at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . However , on the third day of travelling in the city , I felt sick I think I had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
__label__joy	Great idea !
__label__joy	Did she ? That ’ s great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment .
__label__joy	It's my pleasure !
__label__joy	Ha-ha . Birth control and abortion are four-letter words in my family .
__label__surprise	Huh ? Me ?
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__joy	Don't worry . Everything will go well . I promise !
__label__joy	Yeah , I guess I am . Working at a university is really suits me .
__label__joy	Oh , you are such a good child today . Come here . Sit next to me .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	Sounds good .
__label__surprise	an mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? You can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones .
__label__joy	Right !
__label__joy	Yes . Would you like to come here later to have a coffee ? Bring all your family .
__label__joy	sounds very interesting . I can't wait to go there .
__label__joy	Those young actors play the roles perfectly .
__label__joy	Perfect ! I like this one .
__label__joy	What else did you see ?
__label__joy	It's a beautiful day ! Let's play on those rides in the park .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__sadness	Sorry . It is the smallest size we have .
__label__joy	The climate here is pleasant .
__label__sadness	My condolences .
__label__surprise	Oops ! I almost forget about it . Do you see the girl in the middle of the first line ?
__label__joy	Yeah , I like it a lot . It's very pretty . Where did you buy it ?
__label__joy	How many can we choose ?
__label__sadness	I'd like to . But I'm not myself today .
__label__joy	It's time I left .
__label__surprise	Oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ?
__label__joy	Don't mention it .
__label__joy	I'm fine . How about yourself ?
__label__disgust	Egg , this bathroom is a pigsty !
__label__joy	I love green apples .
__label__joy	Great . Thanks for you advice !
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though .
__label__joy	And here is your birthday present .
__label__surprise	Whoa ! Who said you got the job ?
__label__joy	You've come to the right store . We've got a beautiful and wide selection of necklaces for you to choose from .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry.My car's taken .
__label__joy	Thanks , Mr Janus . Of course I trust you , but regulations are regulations .
__label__joy	Yes , I'd love to . Thanks again . Goodbye .
__label__joy	Yes ! We have all assumed that you were the quiet , shy type .
__label__anger	They sure did .
__label__joy	OK.Goodbye .
__label__surprise	Really ? I hope we will do much better under her guidance .
__label__joy	Yeah , you are a good learner . I must commend you for your good performance .
__label__joy	Foxtrot . Oh . you're a good dancer .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Uniforms , sis , no more worrying about appearances !
__label__joy	Do you want to borrow my coat ? I have a black coat that would look smashing on you .
__label__joy	No problem , sir .
__label__joy	I love you , too .
__label__joy	I am free that night , and a party sounds good .
__label__joy	That is a good idea , I love it . What time do you think is convenient ?
__label__joy	Our bass section is really good . You're going to love singing with them .
__label__joy	Exactly ! Oh , my god ! I love Britney ! I'm going to get it .
__label__joy	About 6:00 .
__label__surprise	Okay ... what makes you say that ? I thought you were pleased with his overall performance . Didn ’ t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude ?
__label__joy	What do you usually do with them ?
__label__joy	that ’ s very nice of you to offer . Here ’ s your tea . Be careful , it ’ s still quite hot .
__label__joy	You know , I like traveling . I made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
__label__disgust	But he is always talking big .
__label__joy	Congratulations , Vivian . You won the grand prize , again .
__label__joy	I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today !
__label__joy	Great . This is exactly what I was looking for . I'll buy it .
__label__joy	John ! Wait a second ! I was just heading downstairs for a cup of coffee . You want to come ? I ’ Ve got some good news !
__label__joy	The beans will burn . I know . I've tasted burnt coffee before ... yuck !
__label__anger	I can ’ t possibly travel on a hard seat for 10 hours !
__label__sadness	My bad.sorry !
__label__joy	Yes , it is . Are you here on business ?
__label__joy	Ok , thank you .
__label__joy	This is the good life ! We have it good don ’ t you think ?
__label__joy	I like peach blossom , because I like spring .
__label__joy	That'll be $ 4 . 25 ... ( The customer gives her a 5 dollar bill . ) ... out of five . Here is your change , sir . Have a nice day .
__label__disgust	You stink !
__label__joy	She looks very healthy.How old is she ?
__label__joy	You ’ re a real friend in need .
__label__joy	Got it . Thank you .
__label__joy	Being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich .
__label__joy	Congratulations ! That ’ s wonderful . I bet both of you are quite happy .
__label__surprise	All right !
__label__joy	Can I read it when you're finished ?
__label__joy	Excellent . As soon as we landed , we boarded a bus to Disneyland . I love Mickey Mouse . Janet and I spent the entire first day going on all of the rides .
__label__joy	Oh , I learned that he is also a legendary violinist .
__label__joy	Sure . I'd be very glad to be your tour guide .
__label__joy	Yes . How about you ?
__label__anger	Damn it ! I think I'm going to miss the plane .
__label__joy	Are you having a big wedding ?
__label__joy	I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night .
__label__joy	Hey , that sounds great .
__label__joy	OK . It's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh .
__label__joy	Great ! I can teach you men a thing or two about shopping !
__label__anger	No , you used to be . But not now . You are in love with someone else . You are in love with my friend , Janet . You appreciate her very much . You think she is beautiful and fun to be with and you think I ’ m dumb and uninteresting .
__label__joy	I'd be delighted to , John . Saturday did you say ?
__label__sadness	I am sorry , sir . All the tables have been booked .
__label__sadness	Oh , sorry to have bothered you .
__label__joy	No , you need to turn left into Philimore Was and take the next right .
__label__joy	That's OK . I'll have a glass of water .
__label__joy	That's right . How nice to see you again .
__label__surprise	What ? Then what did you do ?
__label__joy	This facility is great , don't you think ?
__label__sadness	Oh , I ’ m so sorry .
__label__joy	Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's pent-up feelings , and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll and the break dance .
__label__joy	Hey . Let's trade places one weekend !
__label__joy	Matthew ? Hi !
__label__joy	well , good luck . I hope it all goes well for you tomorrow !
__label__surprise	Wow , Arthur ! You ’ re as blind as a bat !
__label__joy	So nice to meet you , David . Call me Bill . It's very nice of you to come here .
__label__joy	That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you .
__label__joy	Sounds ideal . We'll get back to you in a couple of days then .
__label__surprise	Oh , my God !
__label__joy	I'm very glad to hear that .
__label__joy	Yes . Thanks .
__label__joy	Actually they ’ re expecting the baby to come on my birthday .
__label__anger	I have to do some things , and besides , it's not polite to be nosey .
__label__sadness	really ? Who do you chat with ?
__label__joy	I am happy that the wine I brought for you works well with this meal .
__label__joy	What about going to the zoo on Saturday and to the park on Sunday ?
__label__anger	Fine ! I want a divorce !
__label__joy	ok , got it . I ’ ll call you sometime next week .
__label__joy	Thank you for saying so . I don ’ t know , probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them . I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues .
__label__fear	I think you have chicken pox ! You are contagious ! Get away ! Don ’ t breathe on me !
__label__joy	Perfect . Thanks very much for calling . See you soon , bye !
__label__joy	You are so kind . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Thank you . I'm glad that wasn't too much of a bother .

__label__joy	Of course . Can I have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	It is so encouraging to hear this remark . The secret is to make plans . Write down your goals , short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month . Then just work hard .
__label__joy	I'll be back in a sec .
__label__joy	We went for a swim in the sea . That was the biggest part of the day . Just look at my nice tan !

__label__joy	Can I have a bite ?
__label__joy	I'm sure we will . Actually , we are looking forward to seeing the great wonder .
__label__joy	It ’ s okay . I ’ m still waiting to hear from UCLA anyway .
__label__joy	Thank you ! I lived there when I came to Beijing last time . It's comfortable and beautiful .
__label__surprise	Really ? I can't believe it .
__label__anger	I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it !
__label__joy	Yes , disco dancing is my favorite.It ' s great fun and good exercise as well .
__label__anger	He treats everyone pretty poorly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake !
__label__joy	Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ?
__label__anger	You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?
__label__joy	Of course , I ’ Ve enjoyed it very much . I ’ Ve met my old friends and made some new friends .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	I ’ m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison . Many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . I really want to see the crown jewels too .
__label__joy	I'm on a softball league . It's not fast pitch , but it's still fun . You wanna join our group ?
__label__sadness	I am really sorry to hear that .
__label__joy	Hi , darling , I am thinking it is the time of your calling .
__label__joy	Take good care of yourself .
__label__anger	Shut up . You should think how to make fortunes , not look for a squabble .
__label__disgust	The acting of the heroine is too artificial .
__label__disgust	that sounds dreadful !
__label__joy	What time do you open this evening ?
__label__joy	Hey , that ’ s a very nice hairdo you ’ re wearing !
__label__joy	Were you ? your performance was excellent .

__label__joy	OK ! Thank you very much !
__label__joy	You're welcome . Bye .
__label__disgust	That ’ s the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail .
__label__joy	No big deal . I'll do it for you .
__label__joy	I can't believe this for it's been 20 years since we got married .
__label__surprise	What ? Are you serious ? You'd defect to our archrival ! ?
__label__joy	Oh , thank God ! I don't know how to thank you , guys .
__label__joy	No problem at all . Welcome .
__label__joy	So , what did you do out there ? I mean besides bask in the sun , obviously .
__label__joy	Ha , I am flattered . Actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ’ t need to like it . You just need to understand how it works .
__label__joy	That's great , congratulations !
__label__disgust	I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you .
__label__sadness	What a shame ! You should have showed yourself to them !
__label__joy	Yeah , she is so charming . I like her , too .
__label__joy	Thank you , Rick ! As you can see , ladies and gentleman , we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars !
__label__sadness	Let me see . I am sorry , sir . We will change another one for you . Please wait a moment .

__label__joy	Oh , you didn ’ t have to ...
__label__joy	Thanks . I'll tell him .
__label__joy	Well sir , I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose !
__label__joy	That is a good idea .
__label__sadness	Knock on wood . But I have a very important date .
__label__joy	Good , I will take the one hour facial with make-up .
__label__anger	What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck !
__label__joy	Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us.That is excellent exercise and fun , too .
__label__surprise	I need change for the machines ?
__label__joy	Thank you . Do you need the invoice ?
__label__surprise	Those are the ones that are pre-dipped in sweet coating !
__label__joy	This is a very spacious apartment . It's forty pings , including the parking space . That's about one thousand four hundred square feet .
__label__joy	Thanks for inviting me . Here is the gift for you . Happy birthday , Francis ! Many more happy and healthy years for you !
__label__sadness	Excuse me , sir , I'm afraid you can't park your car here .

__label__joy	No , thank you .
__label__joy	I'm glad you like them .. . We'd appreciate your kind consideration in the coming negotiation . Let's drink to our friendship .
__label__joy	And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does .
__label__joy	Sounds good !
__label__joy	Yes , Please.It ' s very kind of you .
__label__joy	Hi Tom ! I'm fine , and you ?
__label__joy	We ’ ll then make an offer as soon as possible . I hope a lot of business will be conducted between us .
__label__joy	Wang , I'd like you to meet my friend . Dou , this is Wang .
__label__joy	Have a great day , take care , bye .
__label__joy	I'm so pleased that you can go .
__label__surprise	Yeah ? What does he want ?
__label__fear	Dad , I'm scared .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__anger	How many chances should I give you ? I've given up on you !
__label__fear	Dan , Dan , dude . You have to come over to my house right now !
__label__joy	See you .
__label__joy	OK , great . Doctor , I think I also may need a Tetanus booster . Last time I got it was maybe fifteen years ago !
__label__joy	No , thanks .
__label__joy	Actually , I prefer to eat at home , and then we'll have more time to have a chat .
__label__joy	Happy Mother's Day to you , Mum !
__label__joy	Did you stop at the Fall for some pictures ?
__label__joy	It's my pleasure .
__label__sadness	Dad , but I don't want to share a room with Peter . He snores every night .
__label__joy	Oh , thank you . Thank you very much .
__label__surprise	Really ? That's great ! Tell me .
__label__joy	I am really impressed with your presentation skills .
__label__surprise	Really ? How long have you been playing piano ?
__label__joy	Is your lady beautiful ? Since I came here from the country , I've not seen her close . Tell me , is she beautiful ?
__label__joy	I'll appreciate it very much .
__label__sadness	My uncle passed away last night .
__label__joy	Thanks . I just got back from summer camp .
__label__joy	I think it's a good way to develop our language ability .
__label__joy	You're welcome , Bob . It was nice meeting you .
__label__joy	Terrific . May I stop by to get that two tickets tomorrow afternoon ?
__label__joy	Yeah . Isn't she hot ?
__label__surprise	I still can't believe it ! So , did you go to cooking school or something ?
__label__joy	That ’ s wonderful . Thank you .
__label__joy	Great . Make sure you buy me a souvenir !
__label__joy	Really ? Can I order anything I want ?
__label__surprise	What ? I don't get it ...
__label__sadness	But she means a lot to me .
__label__joy	Of course ! Both children and adults enjoy her books .
__label__disgust	I think there's more you need to do .
__label__joy	Me too .
__label__joy	Good . I will see you then .
__label__sadness	The food wasn't all that exciting .
__label__joy	I'd love to .
__label__joy	Fine , thanks . I ’ ll have a party next Sunday at home . I ’ m calling to ask whether you can come or not .
__label__joy	Yes , of course .
__label__sadness	I'm afraid not , sir .
__label__surprise	Oh , I ’ m sorry . It completely slipped my mind .
__label__joy	I would like that . Thank you .
__label__sadness	Sorry , but she ’ s out .
__label__joy	Oh yeah ! I'm a great rapper . And I know all the Vanilla Ice lyrics by heart .
__label__joy	Fine .
__label__joy	Yes , too good to be true .
__label__joy	OK , I'll do that .
__label__joy	Couldn ’ t be better . And you ?
__label__joy	It is so wonderful that this transaction turned out to be the satisfaction of both parties .
__label__joy	Yes , when it snows , every where is white . It's very beautiful .
__label__surprise	You must be joking . Those two ?
__label__fear	It ’ s dangerous . I don ’ t dare to go .
__label__joy	Thanks , Miss . I want you to see our new stock of brocade satin , a splendid line , just came in .
__label__joy	Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner .
__label__joy	O . K . See you .
__label__surprise	Really ? That's unusual for October , isn't it ?
__label__joy	Thanks . I plan on it .
__label__joy	I ’ m sure you ’ ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country .
__label__joy	Where did you have it done ?
__label__joy	It's kind of cool , isn't it ? I'm sort of like a secret agent .
__label__anger	This ref needs glasses . Hey ref , open your eyes ! I can ’ t believe he didn ’ t see that !
__label__joy	I think it's going to be a nice day .
__label__joy	It's not that hot . It's cooler than yesterday . Let's go swimming !
__label__joy	We would love to sit outside . Thanks for your help !
__label__surprise	What !
__label__surprise	Sis , why did you ask me to come to this bargain market ? It's so crowded , and you can't find anything that you really want .
__label__joy	Hi ! Yes , it ’ s been a long time . I ’ m really glad to see you .
__label__joy	Thank you . That ’ s perfect timing .
__label__joy	Sure , that would be great . I'll bring the wine .
__label__joy	Dessert sounds perfect , but I would like to split something with my friends .
__label__joy	That would be very nice . Thank you .
__label__disgust	She has nothing that deserves my jealousy . I don't have to put things on my face and I still look pretty . Don't you think so ?
__label__surprise	Wow ! What ’ s the hold up ?
__label__joy	Oh , that ’ s a good choice . Very healthy too .
__label__disgust	So am I .
__label__joy	thank you so much for your advice . I'll think it over .
__label__joy	No , not that one . But I saw the movie . Could I borrow it when you finished ?
__label__joy	Oh , yes . I know where it is .
__label__anger	They are ! Besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment .
__label__joy	( Before Christmas Party ) Are you ready for the Christmas party tonight
__label__joy	It's all good . I'll show you all the right moves . My name's Malik .
__label__surprise	Oh , no . He is not breathing and there ’ s no pulse . Call 911 .
__label__joy	Pleased to meet you too , Ms Jenson .
__label__joy	That's a great idea . Why don't you call him . I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else .
__label__joy	Hey ! That “ stuff ” is my grandma's cooking , and it's good !
__label__joy	The tranquility of the night , the chirping of some insects , everything is so natural !
__label__joy	And a good way to get some pocket money .
__label__joy	Thank you so much .
__label__joy	Thank you . Could you tell me the specials today ?
__label__joy	Let's get a soft drink .
__label__joy	Everybody would like to have Jim on their team . Because he is funny and helpful and he can contribute a lot to the team he belongs to .
__label__joy	I got to meet the night Anger today too . We got along right from the start .
__label__joy	Yes , I'd love to.Here is a good one , Mozart and Beethoven.It ' s on the Festival Hall .
__label__joy	Maybe we can come here again next summer .
__label__sadness	No , he just stole all of my things .
__label__joy	Have a good day !
__label__sadness	Sorry , I won't . I'll be working against the clock to finish my presentation .
__label__joy	Thank you so much for helping me .
__label__joy	That's good . It's good to hit the books , but you need to get out once in a while .
__label__joy	Thanks , Denise . Actually , I was really surprised . I mean , there were a lot of qualified people out there .
__label__anger	And I ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes !
__label__joy	A group of students from the art and music faculty are producing a short film .
__label__joy	Sure ! And without any conversion process or loss of quality ! You quickly find , cut , and record video segments and create slide shows . Some camcorders even offer editing software for adding titles and special effects .
__label__sadness	I am sorry for damaging your car , sir .
__label__joy	Ok , well , my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday . We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . Do you want to come with us ?
__label__joy	That sounds interesting .
__label__joy	Better than ever ! You won ’ t have to worry about “ finding ” extra money for me anymore ! We made nearly a quarter of million in profit last year !
__label__surprise	The cancer ward ! ? Oh , my . It's worse than we thought .
__label__joy	Yes . I think I'm lucky .
__label__joy	Just find the answer through Internet .
__label__joy	Well , as the saying goes – we aim to please !
__label__joy	Oh my gosh , how exciting !
__label__joy	Oh , nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family ?
__label__joy	Fine ! Do you want anything to eat now ?
__label__joy	Congratulations ! Let's get together sometime .
__label__surprise	What ? Your golden watch is lost ?
__label__joy	I enjoy camping .
__label__joy	Well , I haven't been to the theater in a long time .
__label__anger	Well , now I've seen it all ! What a rip-off this place is !
__label__joy	You got it . Well , he walked up to me and said my name again and then I realized it was the boy I had been thinking about , the one from third grade !
__label__joy	Not at all .
__label__surprise	Really ? I've been smoking for over a year now .
__label__joy	Good choice ! But , what's your favorite kind of hard liquor ?
__label__anger	I got the message . I'm quiting .
__label__joy	How beautiful the flower is !
__label__sadness	I failed the exam because I didn't study .
__label__joy	Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me .
__label__anger	Come on ! In the two hours we've been here you haven't sung even one song !
__label__joy	Good idea ! Well , Joan , I have something important to tell you .
__label__joy	How time flies !
__label__disgust	I decided to put him up while he's here , big mistake !
__label__joy	That sounds fantastic ! But I am looking for something closer to downtown , as I spend most of my time at the office .
__label__joy	I think we would be able to make it . What time shall we come ?
__label__joy	You are absolutely right .
__label__joy	We can go to a horror movie , and I'll hold your hand so you don't get scared .
__label__joy	Thank you again for all your help .
__label__joy	How about the new bar across the road ?
__label__joy	Yes , we were lucky . My friend's father owns a resort on one of the islands , so we were able to stay for free .

__label__joy	All right , then let's begin .
__label__sadness	I ’ m sorry , sir . Could you tell me your name and order again , please ? I ’ ll check on the delay .
__label__joy	They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight .

__label__joy	You made a perfect choice , Jack .
__label__joy	Thank you for your compliments . It's just you are a good leader . Do you like the foxtrot and tango ?

__label__joy	I hope so , too . Bye ! Ben .
__label__joy	That's smart thinking .
__label__joy	That sounds like fun . Have a good time .
__label__sadness	No , I'm sorry we don't . We accept credit cards and cash .
__label__joy	Oh , it's so . She looks very lovely . Could you give me some else information on her ?

__label__joy	I'll finish soon .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__anger	I'd say all you've done is moved the dirt from the windows on to your face and hands . Disgraceful !
__label__joy	I'd like to . I'm sure your visit will help to promote the friendship and understanding between both of us.Welcome to China again .
__label__joy	She is very nice and open-minded .
__label__joy	How about this sunday ?
__label__joy	Yes . The drinks are very good ! I'm Paul , by the way .
__label__joy	Sure . I'd love to .
__label__joy	Yes , of course . Have you got the tickets ?
__label__joy	My roommate's having a party .
__label__anger	I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are !
__label__joy	This is a first ! You must have won the lottery .
__label__surprise	Not at all ! That explains everything !
__label__surprise	Wow ! No wonder people are so fat . Say , Carl , looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising .
__label__joy	That sounds cool . Do you mind if I recommend myself for the job ?
__label__joy	Great . I am not interested in Chinese chess . It is too difficult for me .
__label__disgust	Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer !
__label__joy	I quite agree with you . With our hobbies , our life can be more colorful and exciting .
__label__joy	Sounds wonderful . When shall we make it ?
__label__joy	thank you for wonderful meat .

__label__joy	You look so happy . I see a twinkle in your eyes .
__label__joy	How beautiful the detached house is !
__label__joy	That'll be enough , and the repayment period sounds good to me .
__label__joy	The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has .
__label__joy	Well , you're here . And that's the main thing .
__label__joy	I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now .
__label__joy	Wow ! Is it a good car ?
__label__joy	Yeah , I like her way of teaching . She told us not to cram for exams , and to pay more attention to communicating than memorizing .
__label__joy	Sure . We have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the T-shirt . Look at this section .
__label__joy	That sounds great ! I ’ ll take you up on that invitation .
__label__joy	I'm not a very good singer , but I'm a really great dancer ! I love hip hop dancing .
__label__joy	Everything sounds great then ! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details .
__label__joy	David , have you watched the 82nd Oscar Awards Ceremony ? Avatar got the Award of Visual Effect . The movie sounds great !
__label__joy	Exactly , now , tell me the time .
__label__joy	OK . Guess I have to do that before . I can make money my first withdrawal .
__label__surprise	Who got ripped off ?
__label__joy	I think you'll enjoy the food .
__label__joy	For sure ! I mean we ’ Ve learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding , how to check for a pulse , and even how to apply CPR !
__label__disgust	Sure , like taste , variety , nutritional value , what I should do is move into an apartment off campus where I can cook for myself .
__label__joy	I'm studying medicine .
__label__joy	That sounds like fun . Where will it be ?
__label__joy	What do you mean ?
__label__joy	That's great . We will have to charge you 250 RIB for that service , though . Could you please fill in this ? Thanks .
__label__joy	Oh , that's nice . Thank you for arranging all of this .

__label__sadness	I apologize . This should not have to be this way .
__label__joy	Just think , in a few days , I'll be swimming and lying in the sun and just taking it easy .
__label__joy	Are you sure you want me to cut it that short ?
__label__sadness	It's a long story . In a word , I didn't do a good job of it . I messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up .
__label__sadness	I have a really bad toothache ! My cheek is swollen and I can ’ t eat anything .
__label__joy	Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house .
__label__joy	Don ’ t mention it .
__label__joy	That was nice and fast . Thanks .
__label__joy	She's pretty and meek .
__label__joy	Would you like to go to the top ?
__label__joy	I am glad you like it . Welcome next time .
__label__sadness	I am sorry for making you wait so long . Now there is a table available in non-smoking section . Please follow me .

__label__joy	Not bad , thanks .
__label__joy	I'II have another cup of beer insist . I know I don't like to drink alone , especially there are someone sitting there next to me .
__label__surprise	guess what ? I've got great news !
__label__surprise	Why can't I just give you the money for the fine ?
__label__joy	Sure . Any time .
__label__sadness	I love her so much , you know . I want to be alone . Please keep quiet .
__label__joy	Yeah . It ’ s a lot better than mine .
__label__joy	Great , I want it spicy .
__label__anger	That ’ s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ’ s like we went back in time !
__label__joy	Oh . . . By the way , I saw you with your daughter at the office Christmas party . She is really beautiful !
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	That's great . Will that be cash , check , or credit card ?
__label__sadness	Well , I had a terrible day of work , I'm thinking of quiting my job .
__label__joy	Home run by Okapi ! That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Richie Stadium !
__label__joy	Great idea . I ’ m looking forward to it . See you then .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__joy	That sounds like a great salad .
__label__sadness	Certainly not .
__label__disgust	Oh , great . That's just my luck ! I hate those arty movies .
__label__anger	And you didn't think to leave them my cell phone ?
__label__joy	Oh . It was great . I love Ma Lin . He ’ s my favourite table tennis player . Have you seen anything yet ?
__label__joy	Danger , danger ! The exits have been sealed and the doors will remain locked in until the local authorities arrive . Thank you for using our bank . Have a nice day .
__label__joy	How do you research your books ?
__label__joy	Yes , it is.It ' s wonderful after the downpour .
__label__joy	Fine ! I'll be back by nine then . Don't worry .
__label__surprise	But why ? Did I do anything wrong ?
__label__joy	Oh , that's a nice one of all of you together . Do you have the negative ? May I have a copy ?
__label__joy	I hope so . Thank you for saying so .
__label__surprise	The Canadian rock singer ? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday . How did you see her ?
__label__joy	So do I . The sun ... the sand ... the ocean !
__label__joy	I read about that , and the position sounded great !
__label__joy	OK , settled then .
__label__anger	What ? You call that a stir fry ? More meat than vegetables ? That ’ s the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry . What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in ! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap !
__label__surprise	It's twice as big as my room in Taiwan !
__label__surprise	Days ?
__label__joy	Not at all . It ’ s a piece of cake .
__label__joy	How much is it for my hair ?
__label__joy	Let's switch the lights on .
__label__joy	No . I ’ Ve not had the pleasure of meeting her yet .
__label__joy	That's a great idea . I'm going to do the same .
__label__joy	You made a good choice , then ?
__label__joy	That sounds good .
__label__surprise	I thought you had an elephant in your house .
__label__joy	I understand .
__label__joy	Thank you . This place is nice .
__label__joy	I appreciate that , thank you .
__label__anger	The door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking
__label__joy	Please sit down and make yourself at home . Please don ’ t stand on ceremony .
__label__anger	It ’ s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight .
__label__joy	It was really fun chatting with you .
__label__joy	I'd be glad to tell you what I think .
__label__sadness	I have already known that . I didn't get the scholarship , right ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Okay . Thank you . I understand now .
__label__joy	Thanks for the offer . I'll keep that in mind . Oh , the professor is coming . We'll talk more after class .
__label__joy	You have a good taste . It's very much in style this year .
__label__joy	Very good , What's on ?
__label__joy	My friend Jean is very beautiful .
__label__joy	I ’ m ready and willing to help .
__label__joy	I will , Michelle . Speak to you soon .
__label__joy	Yes , thank you for bringing the wine . It really complements the meal .
__label__anger	It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !
__label__joy	I'd love to .
__label__joy	No wonder it smells fragrant .
__label__anger	Uh ! I can't swallow them , Mom !
__label__sadness	I'm afraid he's not in at the moment Dave . He went out about an hour ago and he's not back yet .
__label__surprise	Are you kidding ? I ’ m terrible ! But I love to watch sports . I go to football or baseball games a lot . And I read sports magazines every week .
__label__joy	I think it's great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I've actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine's for a while now , but I wasn't sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment .
__label__joy	Thanks for your understanding . Do you want to make another appointment ?
__label__joy	Maybe that ’ s what I'll do . Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert .
__label__joy	I like Chinese food .
__label__joy	I'm sure you'll have a good time .
__label__joy	Great ! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . Good , good . This week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . Now let ’ s take a look at this
__label__joy	Well , I ’ m really glad we bumped into each other . Have a good trip .
__label__joy	Thank you , Kenvir . You're so kind .
__label__joy	All right . How about this black skirt ? It can be worn for anything---a party , a job interview and even a funeral !
__label__joy	Thanks . Would you give me another favor ?
__label__joy	That ’ s wonderful . Thank you .
__label__joy	Thank you . Could you change it for a purple one ?
__label__joy	Great ! Let's make a reservation .
__label__joy	that's perfect . I'll let him know tomorrow . Thanks !
__label__surprise	I can't believe it .
__label__joy	Very well . If I leave I'll miss you .
__label__joy	Yes , It's really so beautiful with all the things covered by snow .
__label__joy	That would be great .
__label__joy	Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try .
__label__joy	That is true . Speaking of cavities , I am starting to feel something is wrong with my teeth now . Let's get more strawberry chocolate drops before we go home .
__label__joy	I'll drink to that . Thanks for making this a night worth remembering .
__label__joy	I'll have a good day once this day is over .
__label__joy	it sounds good . I'd like to start with a Compare .
__label__joy	It looks like it's going to be sunny .

__label__joy	Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well .
__label__anger	What ? She was cheating on me with that ugly guy . Oh , no , I feel like such a loser .
__label__joy	Pete ! Nice to see you Well , on top the norm , you know , wife and kids and work , I ’ Ve actually gotten into doing some trading .
__label__joy	Smells good ! I ’ ll make some coffee . Do you want me to make you some eggs ?
__label__joy	Yes , everything has been well designed .
__label__joy	You are going to be a father .
__label__joy	Thank you . How much is the fare to that stop ?
__label__anger	How depressed !
__label__surprise	Really ? Are you OK ?
__label__joy	That ’ s right . Just call me if you need anything .
__label__joy	Good !
__label__joy	I couldn ’ t agree more . That ’ s an ideal place for a vacation .
__label__joy	Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money .
__label__disgust	Oh , to be frank , I think it's sheer waste of time to watch it .
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? Which bulletin board ?
__label__surprise	Are you kidding ? I just feel tired right now .
__label__joy	Fine , just fine . And you ?
__label__joy	All right .
__label__joy	Great . Talk to you then .
__label__joy	That's all I'm going to get today .
__label__joy	Yes , please . Thank you for everything .
__label__joy	Thank you for your kindly words .
__label__anger	You are not in a position to question my vision or my statement !
__label__anger	I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time !
__label__joy	He joked later that I was so poor that he had a kind of impulse to protect an ant .
__label__sadness	Oh , I'm sorry .
__label__joy	Thanks . I found these new shoes earlier at the store .
__label__joy	well , I personally don't like then because i don't believe they are healthy .
__label__fear	Oh , my god . What happened ? Are we dying ?
__label__sadness	It's all over . I'm bankrupt .
__label__joy	Sounds like fun . You can count me in ! Just give me directions to the restaurant .
__label__joy	I think so . It's turning out to be a great day .
__label__joy	Perfect . Thank you . Bye ..
__label__surprise	John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ?
__label__joy	I ’ m not surprised . That article certainly added fuel to the debate . Ok . Thanks . Can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me ? I ’ d like to read them .
__label__surprise	Diane Grant ? I haven't seen you for ages !
__label__joy	Thank you so much . I have been expecting to come to China .
__label__joy	I ’ m glad to see you , too . How ’ Ve you been ?

__label__joy	Sounds good . I'll see you at 6 . Do you want directions ?
__label__joy	I'm OK . I promise . Maybe you don't know that I have done with him for a long time .
__label__joy	You are an outgoing person , quite easy to talk with .
__label__joy	My feelings exactly .
__label__disgust	I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job !
__label__joy	Pretty soon cars will be driving themselves .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry I'm so late . I had a really bad day .
__label__joy	Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free .

__label__surprise	God save me ! Is there anything wrong with you ? Didn't I tell you ?
__label__joy	That's exactly the way I feel .
__label__surprise	Oh , dear ! I'll do well I can .
__label__joy	Sure , it's multi-functional . Besides playing music , it can also be used to store documents and make recordings .
__label__joy	I do ! My favorites are Mexican , Thai , and Indian .
__label__anger	I'm tired of you always wearing my clothing !
__label__joy	Haha , jogging ? Perhaps it might be a bit too boring ?
__label__joy	I like the mountain idea , but I am not so sure about the month of January .
__label__disgust	Cheese ! It tastes like cardboard .

__label__sadness	No . I'm afraid the price is too low .
__label__joy	Sounds good . See you there !
__label__joy	That's great . We can go to the bank together .
__label__sadness	I'm very sorry about this .
__label__sadness	Sorry , I couldn ’ t help you .
__label__surprise	Oh , it's unbelievable !
__label__joy	This is the first time for me to have a Chinese guest . I hope you like western cooking .
__label__joy	I ’ m glad you ’ re enjoying it .
__label__joy	that's a good idea . I'll call them now . Thanks for your help !
__label__surprise	Why is that ? It is called real art .
__label__joy	I'll go take a look . Thanks for your help .
__label__sadness	Baby , come on . Don ’ t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ’ t leave me .
__label__joy	You have a good taste . It's very much in style this year .
__label__joy	I like to get rid of clothes that I don ’ t wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe . They take up too much space . There are several charity shops that you can give old clothes to . They will be happy to receive them as long as they are in reasonable condition .
__label__joy	Eighteen.Some friends are having a birthday party for me tonight.Do you want to come ?
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	I love rumba and waltz .
__label__joy	It would be a really good choice . The movie is very suitable for lovers to see together . I'm sure you won't regret it .
__label__disgust	I don't care !
__label__joy	That's fine .
__label__joy	No , but thanks for offering , actually could you bring some fold-up chairs for people if you have any ? I am afraid not everyone's going to have a seat , do you have any ?
__label__joy	yes , good luck , Maria .
__label__disgust	If boys grow up with computer games , they will surely become bad .
__label__joy	Remember , real luck must be created ( by ) yourself , and then it cannot be given or taken away ...
__label__joy	No , the one you have on looks fabulous , especially with your hair like that .
__label__joy	I'm glad you enjoyed it . It's had long run , but the house has always been full .
__label__joy	The operation was very successful .
__label__anger	I can't stand riding the bus .
__label__surprise	Oh , my goodness . Who do I need to talk to ?
__label__disgust	Not good . My cousin is driving me up the wall .
__label__joy	I guess so . I live next door but one , and hope you'll drop in now and then .
__label__joy	Let's find a quiet seat and sit down for beverage .
__label__joy	Not at all .
__label__surprise	Really ? I thought his wife couldn ’ t have a baby .
__label__joy	Oh , I see.Thank you .
__label__joy	Your brand new car is so excellent . I like it very much .
__label__surprise	You mean the boy you met on MSN ?
__label__sadness	No ! My tour bus got a speeding ticket not ten minutes ago . Now my engine is on fire !
__label__joy	Shall we go to a restaurant to celebrate ?
__label__joy	I ’ Ve heard the whether here is ideal , just like spring most of the year
__label__joy	OK . Thank you very much for your trouble .
__label__surprise	Yeah.What a surprise !
__label__sadness	Toilets are in the rear . I'm afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment .
__label__joy	I'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers .
__label__joy	I'm going to a disco with my friends .
__label__joy	Yes , the weather sure is nice today .
__label__joy	I'm pretty sure I'll be all right . In fact , I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you . What time are you planning to start ?
__label__joy	Then I'll see you in the parking lot at five ! Thank you !
__label__joy	Yes , the weather is wonderful , the game is wonderful and the players are wonderful .
__label__joy	Sure .
__label__anger	Peter , if you don't do it soon , I will throw your toys in the trash can .
__label__surprise	No , I didn't . I'm innocent . Those aren't mine . Whatever you found is someone else's stuff . You can't prove anything . I wasn't there when you went in , and you can't prove it's my stuff .
__label__joy	Good . I wish I could have another vacation .
__label__joy	Sure . Where shall I meet you ?
__label__joy	Ok , I will . You have said that many times .
__label__surprise	Really ? I ’ m very surprised . He doesn ’ t look like a guy who ’ d ever do that sort of thing , right ?
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	That sounds like a blue rose ! My sitting by his bed ?
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome .
__label__surprise	I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before !
__label__joy	I've been there ! It really is an amazing work of architecture and art . The entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb , the walls are covered with gems and emeralds !
__label__joy	Well , I want to let your boss know that she ’ d better hold on to you ! You ’ re a hard worker !
__label__joy	Well , you ’ Ve adapted yourself very well . Everyone in our office thinks you ’ Ve made a great progress in the past two years . What is your secret ?
__label__joy	It's almost time to get aboard .
__label__joy	Merry Christmas ! Mr Bean .
__label__joy	Oh , that's great . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	That will be perfect .
__label__anger	Yesterday I had a quarrel with my roommate . I'm really fed up with all this .
__label__anger	Why ? I still wanted to talk to you .
__label__joy	Would you like to play tennis with me ?
__label__joy	Thanks.Miss Zhang .
__label__joy	This sounds better every second . Now , when can I use the stations ?
__label__joy	I'm so excited . Finally , a yard of my own .
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? I know that telephone signal must have been shielded in the elevator shaft , so what did you do then ?
__label__joy	Well , thanks for the suggestions .
__label__joy	Thank you very much . Are you here alone ?
__label__surprise	Was I ? Sorry , I didn ’ t mean to be . I do apologize .
__label__joy	You know , maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone .
__label__anger	Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first !
__label__joy	It's our pleasure .
__label__joy	I'm happy to help .
__label__sadness	Can I have the ticket , please ?
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	Sure . Here you are .
__label__surprise	I can ’ t believe that Obama won .
__label__joy	Great ! I landed on Classic Movies .
__label__joy	Yes , you are always popular with everyone . and you look very pretty today .
__label__joy	Let ’ s do it !
__label__joy	Wow , this is great ! I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious !
__label__sadness	I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . It's a real letdown .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , but I don't know that name . You must have the wrong number .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	When you put it that way , I guess the skies can't hold out on us forever .
__label__surprise	I can ’ t believe these skirts are so cheap .
__label__joy	Wow . That sounds like a bargain . I'm running low on facial moisturizer and powder . Could you ring those up for me along with the lipstick ?
__label__anger	Can ’ t it wait ? I ’ m watching the game right now !
__label__joy	So cool ! Can I get a load of it ?
__label__disgust	I think he had water on the brain . This is bad .
__label__surprise	How did you do that ?
__label__disgust	I dislike it most .
__label__joy	Oh , that sounds nice . I ’ d love to .
__label__joy	You won't need it . Tom is going to treat everybody !
__label__joy	( At the beach ) My bag is so heavy . Let's put the stuff under the tree .
__label__joy	Aw , shucks , ma'am .
__label__joy	Thank you so much .
__label__joy	Thank you very much . Hope you enjoy your stay .
__label__joy	Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on .
__label__joy	Oh , it ’ s open . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	I think so , hopefully we ’ ll have a long and a happy life together .
__label__joy	That sounds like a plan to me .
__label__anger	I hate to see the abuse of animals .
__label__sadness	I guess that ’ s what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day .
__label__surprise	Are you kidding ?
__label__joy	I think your presentation impressed the client , Daniel . You did a good job .
__label__joy	I play tennis there every week . Shall we have a game one day ?
__label__joy	I'm so happy that you found what you wanted . Do you want to use a credit card ?
__label__joy	I've been learning to play go recently . It's an amazing game !
__label__surprise	9:00 !
__label__joy	Thanks.You too !
__label__joy	No problem . See you !
__label__joy	Wow , this is nice ! Ok , sign me up for both publications .
__label__joy	Bye .
__label__anger	Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning ?
__label__sadness	Jake just broke up with me .
__label__joy	Finding the beautiful woman in a red dress next to the fountain wasn't all that hard .
__label__joy	You are welcome . Hope you can find it soon .
__label__joy	I ’ m very well , Thank you . And you ?
__label__joy	Jenny , are you having a good time ?
__label__joy	Yes , we live a happy life together .
__label__fear	Promise that you won't get angry .
__label__joy	Thanks . Charlie !
__label__joy	I really did ! I started thinking about what I wanted to say three weeks ago .
__label__joy	Thanks.Okay . I have my soap .
__label__joy	Ok . That sounds like a deal .
__label__surprise	Oh , no . What did I do ? It ’ s asking me for a password .
__label__joy	Paul sends you his regards .
__label__surprise	Oh , but I suppose he has lots of talents .
__label__surprise	Really ? Congratulations !
__label__joy	What's your comment on his new album ?
__label__joy	Don't worry about it ! Making a new meal out of leftovers is almost an art ! Not only do you save money , but you also get to be creative and have something different to eat !
__label__joy	Wow ! I am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake . I really appreciate that . So , what time are we going ?
__label__surprise	how could it be ?
__label__joy	it's absolutely delicious ! That is the best tiramisu I've ever had !
__label__surprise	What for ? For the party , of course .
__label__sadness	Yes , maybe . But I like street shopping . There is more variety . I'm sorry . I just don't like malls .
__label__anger	It makes me sick .
__label__joy	That's it . She likes dogs so much now , and I begin to love dogs .
__label__surprise	What happened ? Did you have a fight ?
__label__anger	You'd better get on with your homework ! You can practice on Sunday .
__label__joy	What are you doing there with your mobile phone ?
__label__joy	Classic . Something that could calm your mind .
__label__anger	Why didn ’ t you just answer my question directly ? Why would Chinese answer questions this way ? I simply asked if you did it or not . It ’ s a very simple question . And Chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer .
__label__anger	Get out of here !
__label__surprise	That sounds ridiculous . Why ?
__label__joy	That's my good girl . The clothes need washing . I'll do the laundry .
__label__joy	I would if I could .
__label__joy	Okay then , let ’ s go fast ! Whoa ! This thing can really accelerate fast .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__anger	Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .
__label__joy	Let ’ s just say that by the third date , we both realized that we had fallen in love .
__label__joy	You really like it ?
__label__disgust	"He said , Pauline is typing letters . She can't speak to you now ! "" Then I arrived home at six o'clock yesterday evening . He telephoned again . But I didn ’ t answer the phone !"
__label__anger	Well , I ’ m going to write a letter of complaint .
__label__surprise	What a surprise meeting you here , Landy .
__label__joy	You are welcome .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Nothing , thanks . I am just not in the mood these days .
__label__anger	You didn't tell me she was married !
__label__joy	Oh , this feels very nice . It's perfect . I'll take it .
__label__joy	Of course .
__label__joy	I am so sorry to hear that . Is that enough ?
__label__joy	Whew ! That sounds more like my price range . I'll take two liangs .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Your idol ! Wow ! You're even better at finding stuff than me !
__label__joy	It was really an exciting moment .
__label__joy	Sounds good to me . I really appreciate your help on this .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Hey , your Chinese is coming along !
__label__joy	Great - they wined and dined us all week .
__label__disgust	I don ’ t like her husband , that bad egg , but my daughter insists on marrying him .
__label__joy	Yes , they are . This afternoon , I ’ m going to prune the hedge .
__label__fear	I don ’ t know anything about the bills or laws they ’ re trying to pass .
__label__surprise	I don ’ t understand why you always look so happy , so energetic . It seems like you ’ Ve got good news everyday .
__label__joy	Great !
__label__joy	We should really hang out again .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	My pleasure .
__label__joy	That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you .
__label__anger	Yes . I can't find my sweater . I have my laundry sent to you yesterday but when the washing is done . I find my swatter missing .
__label__joy	That means he was head over heels in love with you .
__label__joy	Thank you for inviting me . See you then . Bye , Tom .
__label__sadness	I am afraid not . Have you lost your passport ?
__label__joy	You are so romantic , my sweetheart .
__label__sadness	Oh , I'm so sorry . May I ask what you ordered again ?
__label__joy	Sure , let's go to Malibu .
__label__joy	The seaside .
__label__disgust	Www ! That weirdo ? ! He really gives me the creeps !
__label__joy	I'd be delighted to , John . Saturday did you say ?
__label__joy	That is a good suggestion .
__label__joy	We may go abroad , my wife wants to go to Egypt , and I'd like to go there too . We haven't made up our mind yet .
__label__joy	What's your favorite season ?
__label__joy	Alright . You are the expert . I'm happy to have your recommendation .
__label__sadness	I've made a tough decision , sir . Here's my resignation .
__label__surprise	Never ! He ’ s over 80 , isn ’ t he ?
__label__joy	Happy Mother ’ s Day , Mom !
__label__joy	That's so kind of you . Thank you very much !
__label__fear	Well OK , I am just afraid of getting food poisoning .
__label__joy	There ’ s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ’ t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your business card , I ’ ll make sure you get an advance copy to review .
__label__joy	Great ! When you become new driver , you are better drive as carefully as possible !
__label__joy	You're welcome . Turn the application in at Window B .
__label__joy	That's a good idea . Wish you a great vacation !
__label__joy	Well , I'm so glad to hear that she's doing well .
__label__surprise	Really ? What's the matter ?
__label__surprise	Really ? You're joking .
__label__joy	OK , thanks . I really appreciate it .
__label__joy	I surely know that . Don't forget that I am a regular customer here .
__label__surprise	Well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you ask me what I value most in a friend , I would say honesty .
__label__joy	I know of a restaurant . I'm sure you'll like it .
__label__joy	Yes , there is a lake in the park . It is very beautiful .
__label__joy	I quite agree with you.See the woman there ? I dare say she hasn't got any eyes . How could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? And all that jewelry !
__label__joy	Yes , it's a great job . I love it . And what do you do ?
__label__surprise	I never imagined meeting you here .
__label__joy	Thank you for your encouragement .
__label__joy	Looks like anything fun makes you excited .
__label__joy	We'd like a half-day package .
__label__joy	Thank you . I ’ m leaving tomorrow morning .
__label__joy	En ... it tastes good . I appreciate what you have done for me .
__label__joy	Yes , there is , drinking your coffee !
__label__joy	We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting .
__label__anger	They weren ’ t supposed to arrest me .
__label__sadness	And a storm blew our roof away .
__label__joy	That's very kind of you . Thank you.Er ... have you got a pencil ?
__label__joy	Wonderful ! A modest , comfortable room . Ah , a beautiful window , through which I can see a beautiful scene , and hear the birds singing . How nice !
__label__joy	You are welcome .
__label__joy	Great ! Pasta for dinner .
__label__joy	Yes , sir . That ’ s more than enough time . I do appreciate your understanding . Why don ’ t we say 10:00 o ’ clock on the 27th ?
__label__joy	Really , it was nothing .
__label__joy	Wow , I like concerts .
__label__sadness	I'm thinking of dropping out .
__label__joy	Oh , lovely.Where ' s the wedding going to be ?
__label__joy	Me too . She is so young and talented . She is not only a singer but also a great composer herself .
__label__joy	It ’ s huge .
__label__sadness	Then shall we keep pure friendship ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much . Here is 500 dollars .
__label__disgust	It was hardly all night . And I recall it was you doing all the laughing at your own jokes .
__label__disgust	I hate to complain , but this soup is too salty .
__label__joy	Around six pm .
__label__joy	Sure . We have lemon pies , apple pies , coffee rum pies and ice cream .
__label__joy	Great ! That's settled then .
__label__surprise	Oh , look at the thermometer ! The temperature has hit 98 .
__label__joy	I know . That ’ s why I bought it . I hate wearing the same styles like everybody else is wearing .
__label__joy	I ’ m glad you like them . Happy birthday !
__label__joy	Good .
__label__joy	That's an understatement . I'm on cloud nine . I couldn't be any happier .
__label__sadness	I am sorry to hear that , but face the music .
__label__joy	You are always so hospitable .
__label__joy	Wow . Look how polite your son has become .
__label__joy	Thank you honey , it means a lot to me .
__label__joy	Forget it . It ’ s my pleasure . You mean a lot to me .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__anger	You and I have been together for a whole year , and our vacation time should be about the two of us !
__label__joy	Yeah.The autumn is marvelous here .
__label__joy	Your garden is looking beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful .
__label__anger	It certainly didn't arrive here that way .
__label__joy	I ’ m sure you ’ ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country .
__label__joy	Of course I'm OK ! I just bought a bunch of classic Elvis records !
__label__joy	Actually not ! Our company pays for performance .
__label__joy	You are invited to my wedding .
__label__joy	Great . Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Nice to meet you , John .
__label__anger	Yeah , yeah , we ’ re here because we feel this is an injustice ! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop ! We ’ re there to show the government that we don ’ t like the way that they ’ re spending our tax dollars !
__label__joy	Yeah . It ’ s exciting . This month we ’ re doing crossword puzzles .
__label__joy	next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine .
__label__joy	This is almost like a Taiwanese night market ! I can't believe it !
__label__joy	Ha , I know you are great secretary .
__label__joy	yeah , I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . I'm starving !
__label__joy	Thank you . That would be great .
__label__joy	Congratulations !
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? I went to China last winter !
__label__joy	Thank you ! My wife likes cooking very much .
__label__joy	Oh , there are so many good ones ! I loved the Spice Girls . They were so cool !
__label__joy	Fine ! How about you ?
__label__joy	Thanks a lot !
__label__surprise	really ? Why ?
__label__joy	Marvelous idea ?
__label__joy	No problem . Let's say 6:30 p . m . at the Royal Restaurant , OK ?
__label__sadness	I was turned down again . It ’ s frustrating . I guess you ’ Ve got to teach me some skills .
__label__sadness	I often feel so tired .
__label__joy	Sounds good . Thanks for your help .
__label__anger	There's no hot water , and the building is falling apart !
__label__anger	I'm being attacked by hordes of cockroaches !
__label__joy	Thank you for you help .
__label__surprise	Really ? This is a nice office , but it's quite small .
__label__joy	Oh , yeah , that's embarrassing when that happens .
__label__joy	How nice seeing the sun back again ! The air is so fresh .
__label__anger	Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back !
__label__sadness	Really ? What can I do now ? I can't miss the important meeting .
__label__joy	Well , I'm glad to hear that . Please give my regards to him .
__label__joy	I agree . They're very lovely , especially Huanhuan
__label__joy	Glad to hear your voice , David .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry . The restaurant is full now . You have to wait for about half an hour . Would you care to have a drink at the lounge until a table is available ?
__label__joy	Have a good one .
__label__joy	Nope . That's everything , thanks .
__label__joy	I would recommend the mall , it's about 20 minutes , drive to the south in a taxi . It has a wide range of shops and restaurants .
__label__surprise	Really ? Why would you worry about me ? I ’ m just fine .
__label__joy	So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday .
__label__joy	So everybody's getting video mail .
__label__joy	Welcome back ! How was your vacation ?
__label__fear	Okay , thank you . I'll make another reservation as soon as I can .
__label__sadness	Oh , that's right . You are supposed to deliver a brief on that account tomorrow . I know there are some things I need to share with you about that . But , gosh , I don't know ... Things are really busy for me today , the only time I can manage to squeeze out might be over lunch break ...
__label__joy	And now we have a two-year-old boy . We ’ re very happy that he ’ s healthy and smart .
__label__joy	Thank you for caring enough to check on your scores ; keep studying !
__label__surprise	So I have to pay 25 cents for each day the books are late ?
__label__joy	Here you are . Thank you and goodbye .
__label__joy	You speak really well .
__label__joy	Good , May I have your name , please ?
__label__joy	Me , too . There was always a good round of applause every time she sings .
__label__joy	That will be great .
__label__joy	I ’ m glad you finally agree .
__label__joy	Sure . Take your time .
__label__joy	The same to you .
__label__joy	Sure , thank you .
__label__joy	That's OK . Thanks very much .
__label__joy	Well , hope you will enjoy your first day !
__label__fear	Man , I ’ m freaking out ! You gotta help me !
__label__joy	That's great !
__label__joy	Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ?
__label__joy	That's smart . I'm going to start doing the same thing .
__label__joy	Sounds good . May I have a look ?
__label__joy	That definitely sounds like a steal . I think that is a very trendy neighborhood as well .
__label__joy	Oh , these are great . I think I'll take this one .
__label__surprise	What ? Are you serious ?
__label__sadness	It's too expensive .
__label__joy	That is a heavy raining afternoon . I was standing under the eaves of a shop to evade the heavy rain . It's getting dark .
__label__joy	The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone .
__label__joy	Yes . I'm in the last chapter now and it is just gripping .
__label__joy	Well , yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions .
__label__joy	That sounds good , thanks , I'd like that . Actually I'd like sprite instead of coke , thanks .
__label__joy	Just alright ? ! ? She's hot !
__label__joy	Oh , I'm so happy . I will try my best to love you and protect you . I promise .
__label__joy	I'm most grateful .
__label__joy	Sure . What kind of food do you like ?
__label__joy	Oh , look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color .
__label__surprise	What ? 100 US dollars ? Is it covered by the insurance ?
__label__surprise	Out ? What do you mean out ?
__label__joy	Well , let ’ s go to the marathon tomorrow then ! We can just stand by the side of the road .
__label__anger	I ask you to pass through life at my side-to be my second self and best earthly companion .
__label__joy	Then would you please go to a dance party with me ?
__label__joy	Oh , Jack ! That's wonderful !
__label__surprise	No . Really , what happened ?
__label__anger	I was never told to go to court .
__label__joy	Welcome back racing fans ! My name is Rick Fields and , as always , I am joined by my partner in crime , Bob Copeland .
__label__joy	I used to swim a lot , but now I'm taking gym classes .
__label__joy	Yes , I packed my books in it . Thank you .
__label__joy	That's pretty good . Let's do it .
__label__sadness	I'm absolutely useless at cooking !
__label__surprise	Why , you look pretty all right .
__label__joy	Thanks again for everything you have done for me .
__label__anger	So what ? It is not fresh and I'm not happy about it .
__label__joy	You're right . He sure is .
__label__joy	Oh , you mean Pavarotti , Domingo and Carreras . Have you been to their live shows ?
__label__surprise	What ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
__label__joy	It all sounds exquisite ! I can ' t wait !
__label__disgust	Company ? I heard about you from Linda . She said you were an octopus !
__label__joy	That'd be nice .
__label__sadness	But she did and it made me disappointed .
__label__sadness	I sure did .
__label__fear	Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me !
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , that's bad luck .
__label__sadness	Well , I do feel quite down because I am going to miss Japan after being here for 9 months , in Japan . I am going to miss it so much , cause I've had a great time here .
__label__surprise	how could it be ? They are due two weeks later .
__label__joy	That ’ s it . Thank you .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	I was hoping that we could take a walk down the street to my favorite cafe .
__label__joy	You're welcome , glad to be of assistance .
__label__joy	Whatever , I ’ m going next door I heard Mrs . Robinson is giving out big bags of M & Ms !
__label__joy	Thank you . That's very nice of you .
__label__sadness	Our red underwear didn't do any good at all !
__label__joy	Is that your wedding ring ?
__label__sadness	I am sorry , sir . I have to give you a ticket . You can appeal to the court within 14 days . You will avoid paying the fine if you can prove that you are not at fault .
__label__joy	How'd you like to go on a bungee jump this weekend ?
__label__joy	Oh , you've already grown up , son .
__label__anger	No , we got no receipt , but we paid on the spot .
__label__joy	Yes , I will . I should learn more from you . After all I am green hand on it .
__label__disgust	I don't buy your story . Try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ?
__label__anger	I've already suffered enough without listening anymore to you !
__label__sadness	I'm so sorry , but rules are rules .
__label__anger	You ’ re questioning my ability ? I tell ya , I can make it ! I ’ ll talk to your boss .
__label__joy	I ’ m glad you ’ re enjoying it .
__label__joy	That sounds great . I'm absolutely starving ! What kind of food are you in the mood for ?
__label__joy	He is a nice guy and very considerate . I am impressed with how smart he is and he has a great sense of humor .
__label__joy	OK ! Thank you .
__label__joy	We're going to a night club for dinner and dancing , then we'll go down to the city square for the big celebration . There's always a fireworks display put on by the local government . We all want you to come too .
__label__joy	Not at all . The changing rooms are just this way .
__label__joy	It ’ s a fun job .
__label__joy	Good luck and let me know if you need any help later on .
__label__surprise	So soon ? It seems to be in the early stages .
__label__joy	Got that .
__label__joy	And this kind of weather is rare for the season either .
__label__joy	Mother Nature is quite an artist .
__label__joy	Are you OK today ?
__label__joy	So coincidental . Actually we can exchange some information on this problem .
__label__joy	It was great to meet you last week at the conference . I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment .
__label__joy	You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ’ t have to pay for my trip .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot
__label__joy	OK .
__label__joy	OK . Wait a minute .
__label__surprise	What ? That's too much .
__label__anger	It doesn't look good at all .
__label__joy	I'm awfully sorry to have bothered you .
__label__joy	Great . How much is this going to cost ?
__label__joy	Sounds great .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Good morning , Mary !
__label__joy	It's a lovely day , isn't it ?
__label__surprise	Oh my God , don't you know that such living environment is not healthy ?
__label__joy	It was so fantastic I didn ’ t really want to come home .
__label__joy	Sure , as long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight !
__label__surprise	Wow ! Isn ’ t that dangerous ?
__label__joy	It ’ s very kind of you to say so . My associate and I will be interested in visiting your factory .
__label__joy	That's cool . What documents do I need to carry ?
__label__joy	I'll come prepared .
__label__joy	Thanks . I will .
__label__joy	Sounds good . You have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . I know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms , especially if the stores have special offers .
__label__surprise	Wow ! That ’ s fast ! I don ’ t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway .
__label__joy	I like this kind of weather .
__label__surprise	You did ? Wow ! Where did you learn ...
__label__joy	It's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun .
__label__joy	"Right . But people at that time only know two words , "" save "" and "" assistance "" , they will never don't lift a finger . Life is the most important compared with anything else ."
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome .
__label__joy	What ’ s that ? It gets the name from the festival itself . That ’ s really funny !
__label__disgust	I'm too tired now . I've already worked for 12 hours overtime !
__label__disgust	Many people , many tastes . She looks pretty , but the way she speaks gives you goose bumps . I feel sick of it .
__label__joy	That ’ d be great , but could I have a cup of tea first ?
__label__joy	You're most welcome .
__label__sadness	Yes , I'm serious . I'm really sorry about missing your concert .
__label__joy	Yeah , I'd like to go . Do you think we should have dinner first ?
__label__joy	Where should we meet ?
__label__joy	Thank you for coming , Ms.baker .
__label__joy	Thank you , Mr . William . Goodbye .
__label__surprise	Really ? What's that ?
__label__joy	Life is like a box of chocolates , you never know what you're gonna get .
__label__joy	Arm - I think it was in the CD shop in the Mall . Have you been there ?
__label__joy	Thanks for your belief .
__label__joy	Yes , I like it . I'm going to get it .
__label__surprise	Are you serious ? We ’ Ve been friends for years ! We can ’ t just change that overnight !
__label__joy	Sounds like a good car ! How many miles to the gallon ?
__label__surprise	what happened ? Why didn't he win ?
__label__joy	Yes , you have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well .
__label__joy	I'll check it for you ... sorry to keep you waiting . I've found it.Is this yours ?
__label__fear	Some people are wildly shooting on the next street . We must leave here as soon as possible !
__label__joy	Thank you , Mr . Foster , see you this Tuesday at 7
__label__joy	Well , that was fun . Let's do it again soon .
__label__joy	The Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food .
__label__joy	I might try it myself .
__label__joy	Yes , I'll be promoted to department manager .
__label__surprise	That's incredible . Could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
__label__joy	The tallest one .
__label__anger	Yeah , after all the explanations like , it ’ s too heavy , I was in a hurry ... whatever .
__label__joy	I don't know whether we are in a dream .
__label__joy	My pleasure , see you tomorrow evening .
__label__joy	A fly-away tie ! What a riot !
__label__joy	How is night life in Beijing ?
__label__joy	Woo , that's quite convenient .
__label__joy	Not bad.It really is great to see you again.Where have you been ?
__label__joy	The dress is slim in cut .
__label__joy	Well , it is a birch tree.It is not as old as you think .
__label__joy	Daddy , I love this Happy Farmhouse . It's really fun .
__label__joy	Confirmed . Thank you for using our bank ! Please remove your card from the slot . Goodbye !
__label__joy	Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ?
__label__joy	Thanks for your help .
__label__joy	You're smart to buy it . At 45 dollars for three days , it is a good deal .
__label__joy	Good . I am here visiting my girlfriend . I want her to have a good time .
__label__joy	Yes . Very wonderful .
__label__sadness	I fell down and hurt my arm .
__label__joy	Here is a guiding plan .
__label__joy	I have to get home , but I don't need all of this fancy technology , I think I'll just walk .
__label__joy	Not at all .
__label__joy	Wow , this is amazing . I'm glad we've come here . So cool .
__label__joy	Oh my gosh ! Your hair is amazing ! So silky , so shiny ! I am going to work my magic on your hair ! You hear me ? You are going to look like a million bucks !
__label__sadness	Oh , sorry , I don't have it on me . Honestly , I forgot it at the house . But I have the insurance policy with me . Here it is .
__label__joy	Wow ! It ’ s really good for me , especially the living room . It is big enough to put all my stuff there . It ’ s a deal ! I ’ ll rent this one .
__label__joy	Great ! Can you set the table ?
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	With our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan , the borrower can borrow up to 80 % of the purchase price .
__label__joy	Well here . Help yourself to some shrimp . It's fresh .
__label__joy	I'm dreadfully sorry . I forgot to book the tickets yesterday .
__label__surprise	Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me !
__label__anger	Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment .
__label__joy	Pleased meet you , too , Mr . Dou .
__label__fear	I wish everything in life was so simple . Thank you .
__label__anger	Well , the wrong information is in my file . I was at a concert Monday night .
__label__joy	That's fine . OK . Thanks .
__label__joy	Whenever I go to Vegas , I get really excited .
__label__joy	It was terrific.The concert was really a hit.The symphony orchestra was so good that I was completely absorbed in their performance .
__label__surprise	You're not sure ? You were going at 90 miles per hour ! That's 25 mph over the legal speed limit ! Have you been drinking ?
__label__anger	Oh , you men ! You're all the same .
__label__joy	Thanks ! These are beautiful . You shouldn't have !
__label__joy	It was one of the best times in my life . It was tough , but I made it . I became a college graduate .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry . That must have really been a nightmarish day for you and your family .
__label__surprise	What are you talking about , we tried everything !
__label__joy	Yeah , you can count on it .
__label__joy	Thank you . Here is four hundred yuan .
__label__joy	That ’ s a good idea . Remember that if the parents watch too much tv , the kids will probably follow suit .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__sadness	I am afraid not , darling . Our expenses are mounting .
__label__surprise	Frightened ? You must be joking .
__label__fear	I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .
__label__joy	Did you see Ally Mabel last night ?
__label__joy	You know , although we've chatted twice , I've been thinking of you already .
__label__surprise	I ’ Ve never seem such a scene either except in films .
__label__joy	It's nice . But what kind of dress are you looking for ?
__label__anger	But didn't you tell him you had an appointment ?
__label__joy	Sounds good . See you there .
__label__joy	Guess what ? I won the speech contest at my school .
__label__fear	Wait , what are you doing ? I ’ m a married woman ! You can ’ t just try to kiss me like this !
__label__joy	That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot .
__label__joy	I see . It's interesting that there is also a parrot in my English book . His mane is Polly .
__label__joy	Wow ! That sounds like pure luxury .
__label__joy	That was nice of you , Susan . Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	It was good . I brought lunch from home today .
__label__joy	Sure . Wait a minute .
__label__joy	Take good care of yourself , Mary .
__label__joy	Well ... l like the traditional flavors like rum raisin , butter pecan . maple walnut , strawberry , chocolate and vanilla . But now there are some new flavors from Asia like green tea and durian .
__label__joy	Yes , I got a job as a Management Trainee .
__label__surprise	Days ?
__label__joy	Yes , I went to the New Year's Concert in 2005 .
__label__joy	I think you look fantastic . Happy Birthday !
__label__joy	Good idea . Thank you .
__label__joy	That's a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library !
__label__anger	For God's sake ! It's too bloody . How can people be so cruel ?
__label__joy	That's great . But can you make the rent cheaper , let's see , 12,000 Yuan ?
__label__joy	Oh , I like the color .
__label__joy	I hope it will last fine Sorrow . I'm going to have a picnic with my family .
__label__disgust	I feel he's like a talking machine .
__label__joy	Actually it was the most interesting day I ’ Ve had so far .
__label__surprise	really ? How did you do that ?
__label__disgust	It's just like listening to a language which you know nothing at all .
__label__joy	How have you been ?
__label__anger	Oh , how annoying !
__label__anger	I am maintaining the building . You are way too picky !
__label__joy	It is my pleasure to have her in my class .
__label__joy	Sure it is . Why don't we go to a park ?
__label__joy	Actually , I'm already working for WebTracker . Vince never wanted to give me what I was worth , so I figured , what the heck .
__label__joy	Thank you for meeting me here .
__label__joy	It'll be fine .
__label__disgust	Rude people are everywhere .
__label__joy	Thank you , they ’ re beautiful . You can hang your coat over there . Try this new couch , it is so comfortable . You will love it . Want something to drink , tea , coffee , juice or Cola ?
__label__sadness	But I often skip his classes , and he doesn't like me .
__label__joy	it's challenging , but I'm enjoying it quite a bit .
__label__joy	They are very compact and are designed to be used with one hand .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	I'm very glad to meet you . May I have this dance with you ?
__label__joy	Be prompt . Don't forget to be friendly and interested . Listen carefully and listen to what they are really asking you . You'll be a hit !
__label__joy	Oh , I have got it . How nice are the singers singing !
__label__joy	Yes , it is . Thanks . I ’ m just surfing on the internet .
__label__joy	That's wonderful news ! I'm glad we decided to rethink our actions ; it's all turned out for the best this way . Thank you for helping us to fix that little problem .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , I overslept .
__label__joy	Susan , good evening . Why are you so dressed up ?
__label__joy	Good ! I am really thirsty . You know it really is hot outside !
__label__joy	I sure did . You're in luck ! It's supposed to snow all week in the mountains !
__label__sadness	My opponent bowled me with the very first ball . I was wondering if it's appropriate for me to play table tennis .
__label__joy	Mum , this is for you .
__label__joy	OK.Then I'll be expecting you .
__label__joy	Are you a music lover ?
__label__surprise	Are you crazy ? You were cheating .
__label__surprise	Hug and kiss ? ! How is it possible ? Oh , it's really bad to Miun - Verstand her meaning .
__label__joy	Thanks , Mr . White . That's very kind of you .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Great idea . Unlike you , I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand . I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin .
__label__surprise	Is that right ? This sure beats the old one ?
__label__joy	Playing tennis twice a week will be a good start . Count me in .
__label__sadness	Toilets are in the rear , I am afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment .
__label__sadness	I've searched everywhere . Where on earth did I put it ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	You are kind . Look there is a big tree over there , it looks like a thousand-year-old tree .
__label__joy	I went there last year . If you want , I can give you some information I have about the city .
__label__joy	Thanks . But it ’ s necessary for me to buy a TV set .
__label__sadness	I am worried about how I am going to pay my tuition .
__label__joy	That's very good advice !
__label__sadness	How upsetting ! He has been away for a week !
__label__joy	You'll love this ! I can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
__label__joy	Ah , great ! I'll send someone over to pick it up . Thanks for calling .
__label__joy	What's more , he said I was the hardest working person in the office !
__label__joy	Have a nice day , bye !
__label__surprise	You are not serious ?
__label__joy	That ’ s great .
__label__joy	I'd like to come back next weekend .
__label__joy	Oh , it is precious .
__label__surprise	Oh . really ? I saw it two years ago . It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking .
__label__joy	Thank you for your help .
__label__joy	Happy birthday ! This is for you , Kate .
__label__joy	wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases .
__label__joy	You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ?
__label__anger	Emily , what kind of report is this ?
__label__sadness	I'm afraid I forgot to lock the door .
__label__fear	Oh , dear ! How ruthless !
__label__joy	If you need help , don ’ t hesitate to ask me .
__label__joy	I like chocolate myself .
__label__joy	Oh , thank you so much .
__label__joy	Okay . I'll pick you up at 6:00 .
__label__joy	I will bring a big hat and apply a lot of sunscreen before setting off the beach .
__label__joy	Sounds good . When and where shall we meet ?
__label__joy	I'll buy a set . But you have to teach me .
__label__joy	Oh , Linda , you must be so excited about going to study in America .
__label__joy	I will do my best .
__label__joy	That's good . See you on Friday .
__label__joy	It's the most fun I've had in years .
__label__joy	Medium one will be perfect , thank you
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	I see . Thanks .
__label__joy	There are thousands of hot springs and fountains . The park is known for them .
__label__joy	It's going to strike 12 o'clock . Let's get the firecrackers ready , Rose .
__label__joy	Thank you . You do me a big favor .
__label__joy	Thanks for coming over to help . I really appreciate it . First , could you peel the vegetables ? I ’ Ve put them all in the skin and there ’ s a peeler .
__label__joy	Oh , that would be lovely . Shall we say seven o ’ clock ?
__label__joy	Hey , if you're not busy this weekend , would you like to go see a movie ?
__label__surprise	Seriously ? But you are such a genius .
__label__joy	Thank you , they ’ re beautiful . You can hang your coat over there . Try this new couch , it is so comfortable . You will love it . Want something to drink , tea , coffee , juice or Cola ?
__label__joy	The line is connected . Please go ahead .
__label__disgust	They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
__label__joy	Of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ...
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	I hope this won ’ t be our last meeting .
__label__joy	I think this summer is a good time to visit Berlin . It's a beautiful place and the people there are very nice .
__label__disgust	A man stepped on my feet when I was waiting for the taxi .
__label__joy	I hope you are Settling in at school !
__label__joy	Thank you . I am very excited .
__label__joy	Thank you !
__label__surprise	Oh , you do ?
__label__joy	No . She is actually very intelligent and well behaved .
__label__disgust	Yeah right ! I ’ m serious ! You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! It ’ s really not healthy !
__label__joy	Pretty good . How's your business going , Kevin ?
__label__joy	You're going to do great . And you're going to look great .
__label__joy	But there aren't any lotus now .
__label__joy	I usually come with a group of friends . We dance a little , have a few drinks , and just have a good time .
__label__surprise	What ? Why ? Can ’ t you renew it ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? How does the book end ?
__label__joy	I ’ ll pick you up at ... say , seven thirty ?
__label__joy	Alright . That's a good idea .
__label__surprise	I can ’ t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice !
__label__joy	Sounds fascinating . Where is your new house located ?
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	Ah ! That sounds interesting .
__label__joy	To tell the truth , I don't like it . It's too fast .
__label__joy	Well , it all looks so good . How about ordering the steamed prawns ?
__label__joy	Yes . The scenery is so breathtaking .
__label__joy	Of course . Please take it easy .
__label__joy	Thank you , I will . What are you up to today ?
__label__surprise	What a bone head ! Be careful next time .
__label__joy	Yeah . He was a real slave driver . He probably would have loved it if we were robots .
__label__joy	I heard you received a prize for you book .
__label__joy	Certainly . As you can see , we have several three-piece suites on sale . Feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
__label__anger	How many chances have I given you ? I don ’ t trust you any more .
__label__joy	Interesting . Hey , look over there . The dance floor is already packed with people . Oh , the girl in red dances great .
__label__joy	My dad will love this . He's a Dilbert fan .
__label__joy	thank you , Steve . You're always so encouraging .
__label__joy	I just love your hair that way .
__label__joy	Nice weather , honey !
__label__joy	I promise .
__label__joy	Thanks , I appreciated it .
__label__joy	That's good . Is the location easily accessible ?
__label__joy	No , I feel young , fresh and energetic .
__label__anger	I really like the record you lent me the other day .
__label__joy	I thought you had forgotten .
__label__joy	It is really gorgeous out today . I remembered the weatherman said it is supposed to rain .
__label__joy	Well . Don't worry about it , I will be happy to share the taxi with you .
__label__sadness	I messed up .
__label__surprise	Oh , that's a nasty cough . Let me feel your head . You're on fire !
__label__joy	Congratulations on your success .
__label__joy	No problem . Thank you .
__label__sadness	Please accept my deep apology .
__label__surprise	Really ? I think that's impossible !
__label__joy	What a splendid idea !
__label__joy	No more , thank you . I'm quite full .
__label__joy	Normally I couldn ’ t do that . But under the circumstances , I ’ ll see what I can arrange.Customer satisfaction is our primary aim .
__label__fear	Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me !
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__joy	You have made a good choice , sir . I drive an Accord myself . They are very solidly built machines , very reliable .
__label__disgust	I'm really sick of waiting for a bus .
__label__joy	I bet . That's great news . I'm very happy for you .
__label__joy	I will . Thank you .
__label__joy	That ’ s great . Thank you so much .
__label__joy	I believe most of them think it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known .
__label__joy	What does it say ?
__label__joy	Today is your birthday . First of all , happy birthday to you !
__label__surprise	What ? But it is my favorite piece of clothing .
__label__joy	Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them .
__label__joy	Cool , we can take the football , shuttlecock and badminton racket to the park .
__label__joy	Alice , I never knew you had such a lovely voice . You really can sing , can't you ?
__label__joy	Sure ! It's txyb@gmail.com .
__label__joy	How do you like this waltz ?
__label__joy	Here is your receipt.Thank you .
__label__joy	And I like the festivities of winter with Thanksgiving , Christmas and New Year .
__label__disgust	Yes , I do . Leave me alone !
__label__joy	Well , that ’ s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money .
__label__joy	A bit over two years . This is a fast-moving company , and seniority isn ’ t the only factor in deciding promotions .
__label__joy	Excellent . Have you had French food before ?
__label__joy	Well , it's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds . But besides a beautiful story , the cinematography is great . There is some really dramatic footage . It's really quite a visual feast . And the soundtrack is moving .
__label__joy	Thanks . Cheers .
__label__joy	How about this one ? I think it looks terrific on you .
__label__joy	That's a good idea . Let's go !
__label__joy	My pleasure .
__label__disgust	I worked with him for two years . That was the worst time in my career .
__label__joy	It's over there . Have a good trip .
__label__joy	Don't worry . I will build your deck with a simple but classic look .
__label__joy	I'm really looking forward to reading your column .
__label__joy	Wow ! So many choices you have ! I wish I could , but I just can't . I'm on a diet to lose weight .
__label__joy	I hope not . I think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on the Earth .
__label__surprise	Management ? Wow , I had no idea I could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff .
__label__joy	Sounds good .
__label__sadness	It's an ugly day today .
__label__joy	I'll have another cup of beer insist . I know I don't like to drink alone , especially there are someone sitting there next to me .
__label__joy	You know , I fell in love with this house the first moment I laid eyes on it .
__label__joy	Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry . I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter .
__label__joy	Here it is . We are pleased to serve you here and we look forward to seeing you again . Wish you have a good day .
__label__joy	Of course .
__label__joy	What a wonderful party ! I had a good time . How about you ?
__label__disgust	We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything . We have termites in the wood , cockroaches all over the place , and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard !
__label__joy	I love that vase .
__label__joy	Excellent .
__label__joy	All right , thank you very much . Good bye .
__label__joy	Wow . That sounds really good .
__label__anger	You ’ re a liar !
__label__anger	I don't care about that , Allen ! What did he steal ? That's the question !
__label__joy	I am just doing what I think I should do .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__surprise	Oh ! You mean she doesn ’ t have to work now ? It ’ s hard for young parents not to overreact , isn ’ t it ?
__label__joy	It ’ s so great to be here ! I ’ m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home !
__label__joy	Don't worry . It is a test of physical endurance , intelligence . Just to finish it is considered a victory for most .
__label__joy	I really appreciate that the listing agent provided water on such a hot day .
__label__joy	That's pretty advanced .
__label__joy	Port , please .
__label__joy	I'd love to try some snacks .
__label__joy	You see ! Everything happens for a reason ! We wouldn ’ t even have met if I hadn ’ t been in that car accident ten years ago !
__label__joy	Do you like olives ? Or would you prefer crisps ?
__label__joy	Quite delicious , especially the pepper steak .
__label__surprise	Oh , dear .
__label__joy	No , but I do like snowboarding .
__label__joy	I couldn't agree with you more .
__label__joy	No need . I have only this small handbag with me .
__label__joy	thanks a lot . You ’ Ve been very helpful .
__label__surprise	Oh , no ! Why ? I was looking forward to seeing you at my new place .
__label__surprise	You're serious ?
__label__joy	Sure . Here you are , $ 200 , Thank you , please come again ! Now it ’ s my turn to roll the dice .
__label__joy	Here you are . Thank you
__label__joy	We've got a beautiful two - double room with a bath an shower .
__label__joy	Wow , I can't thank you enough .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	Hello , let me introduce myself . I'm your neighbor . My name is Shirley .
__label__surprise	Yes , it's really a surprise . How are you ?
__label__joy	No , seriously . I'm impressed .
__label__joy	Thanks for calling .
__label__joy	Someone brings a truck to the game and we have a barbecue right there in the parking lot out of the back of the truck !
__label__sadness	I'm so sorry . I have no idea of it . I washed silk dress the first time . I'll buy a new one for you or I'll give you money .
__label__joy	That's wonderful . By the way , what kind of cabin will I have ?
__label__joy	I see . I'd like to reserve a table for two .
__label__surprise	what ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
__label__joy	That sounds very good . Which website should I visit to download it ?
__label__surprise	Crazy ! He locked himself in the room .
__label__joy	That's amazing . I'd love to try it later . Oh , an on-line virtual supermarket ?
__label__anger	You know you didn't .
__label__joy	Oh , that ’ s a nice idea . Well , it ’ s fine if you take our picture .
__label__joy	See you in the morning .
__label__joy	If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
__label__surprise	It's $ 42 ! ! That's expensive !
__label__joy	That's remarkable .
__label__surprise	Oh , Really ?
__label__joy	Flowers for my favorite girl .
__label__joy	Okay , let's go !
__label__sadness	This is not what I asked for . I'm afraid .
__label__joy	Yes , of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
__label__joy	Would you like to meet me at the coffee house next door ?
__label__joy	that will be all . You're been very helpful , thanks .
__label__joy	Well , I also hope our cooperation will be never-ending . Thank you again .
__label__anger	Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch !
__label__joy	Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ?
__label__surprise	Really ? Doesn ’ t every teacher have a teacher ’ s pet ?
__label__joy	It ’ s a wonderful Spanish style .
__label__joy	That is fine .
__label__disgust	She never cares about others .
__label__joy	That sounds OK . I'll need it from the 10th to the 14th .
__label__joy	Aright . I'll meet you there at one o'clock .
__label__joy	Yes . What about you ?
__label__joy	What a wonderful sight !
__label__joy	That's an attractive plan . I'll think about it .
__label__joy	That's all right . May you have a good trip !
__label__anger	I ’ m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP !
__label__joy	Let's just hope my teacher agrees .
__label__joy	It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it .
__label__joy	Well . I think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the Paralympics .
__label__surprise	Oh , there ’ s a charge ? Why ?
__label__joy	I ’ m sorry , sir , we cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time , instead , you are granted a resident visa ! Congratulations , you are the millionth person to apply for a visa ! You win ! Congratulations !
__label__anger	Oh , dad , I'm not a child . I'm 17 already . I'll come back as soon as the film is over .
__label__joy	Thank you very much for looking after my house in my absence .
__label__joy	Make sure and come back in a couple of weeks .
__label__joy	The black ball has to be the final ball in the pockets .
__label__joy	Yes I have . I ’ Ve been there three times in the past year .
__label__joy	Sure . Why not ?
__label__joy	You said it . Ok , let's go in , Sandy .
__label__sadness	Yes , I know . I regret it very much .
__label__joy	That's 20 dollars . Keep the change !
__label__surprise	Sign ? What ’ s sign ?
__label__joy	Oh , very easy . They are heart , spade , club and diamond .
__label__anger	They had no reason for arresting me .
__label__anger	This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ’ ll give you your money back !
__label__surprise	What ? How could you forget to reserve the concert tickets ?
__label__joy	I ’ ll be glad to help .
__label__joy	How about the soup ?
__label__sadness	I was . It ’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won ’ t be able to home because I can ’ t afford the airfare . I ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family .
__label__joy	I know ! Anyways I just talked to Alex ’ s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party It ’ s gonna be so much fun ! All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night .
__label__joy	Not at all .
__label__joy	It was so perfect that it won a unanimous 10 .
__label__anger	What do you mean ? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . It ’ s brand new !
__label__joy	We had a fantastic time .
__label__joy	Thanks . I appreciate it .
__label__joy	Alice , it really was great . I think it was the most interesting thing here . You really should go in .
__label__surprise	Six months ' salary ? Are you serious ? That's incredible !
__label__anger	Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me !
__label__joy	Nice and warm again , isn ’ t it ?
__label__joy	Well , we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia .
__label__joy	Wow ! What a lucky girl ! Your birthday is on Christmas Day .
__label__surprise	How in the world did you guess that ? Did someone tell you already ?
__label__joy	OK . Thank you .
__label__joy	That's good . You can make breakfast yourself if you don't like it .
__label__joy	I'd be glad to . I love picnicking .
__label__joy	But thank you very much all the same .
__label__joy	Yes . I find dates to be a lot of fun .
__label__joy	Is classical music your favorite ?
__label__joy	Hey Lucas , how was your trip to Paris ?
__label__joy	Hello Wang . I'm Dou . Pleased to meet you .
__label__disgust	Your Rose is a fool .
__label__anger	To hell with you . The accident was your fault .
__label__joy	Very good . Perhaps you'd like something else to go with the roses ?
__label__joy	The state of economy is starting to go up in our country .
__label__joy	Great . I have also been thinking of getting one . Do you think you could ask Jane to have a quiet word with Margaret ? My birthday is not that far away .
__label__joy	I like painting , sailing , watching football and talking to you .
__label__surprise	Oops !
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	I will . Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	I was happy to help .
__label__anger	What do you expect ? I've been working for you for three years , and you've never given me a holiday . I don't feel well today , because I have a terrible headache . I am not in the mood for being gentle and polite . If you can't stand it , it's your problem . I am not going to change , because I think it suits you best .
__label__joy	Wow ! I can't wait to change into my trunks !
__label__surprise	Really ? Is there a foreign teacher for every class ?
__label__joy	Thanks . I'll need a while to choose.Could you come back in a minute ?
__label__joy	How are you these days ?
__label__joy	Count me in !
__label__surprise	Look ! they've taken your fur coat too .
__label__joy	Thank you . You save me .
__label__joy	That dress is very pretty . Why don ’ t you like it ?
__label__joy	Well , I certainly couldn't have done it without your help . You are the best tutor I've ever had .
__label__joy	Oh , I see . People who don't understand the nature of flowers won't be able to grow them well . I can help you learn more if you want to plant flowers one day . In this way you need not be afraid of your own sweet flower-garden's being neglected .
__label__surprise	Oh , boy . His wife can ’ t be happy about that .
__label__joy	Yeah ! I bought it the day it was released .
__label__joy	Good . I think you'll make a good cashier .
__label__joy	That looks graceful on you .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot . I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . You ’ Ve been doing some great work .
__label__anger	Do you have any idea what time it is ?
__label__joy	Great idea . I ’ m looking forward to it . See you then .
__label__joy	Not quite . I also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
__label__joy	There we go . Thanks very much .
__label__joy	Yes . What a good job we have done !
__label__joy	That's really cheap for shoes like those . OK , I'll take 5 pairs .
__label__surprise	Really ? What happened ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	I think so . Bye !
__label__joy	I promise !
__label__surprise	You are kidding ! He just broke up with Ann .
__label__surprise	Really ? I ’ m surprised .
__label__joy	No , I'm not hungry .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , it was too cold , and my car couldn't start . I had one to the garage with the heater . I tried to call you , but you couldn't get connection .
__label__joy	How about the dessert ?
__label__sadness	I am sorry , Bob . If you had told me you were coming up , I would have kept tonight free . But you didn ’ t tell me .
__label__joy	Thank you . How much is it ?
__label__joy	Thank you . The same to you .
__label__joy	I am going to miss you , too .
__label__joy	You're right . I probably should just work on my paper . Thanks !
__label__joy	Merry Christmas . Steven !
__label__sadness	I don't think so . You have to wait for about 10 minutes .
__label__joy	How nice ! Have fun !
__label__joy	of course.it is really fantastic too , and it makes me eager to dance .
__label__joy	I was trembling in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked , ' Where is your home ? '
__label__joy	Yes , it is . Thank you very much .
__label__sadness	Oh , that's terrible ! What bad luck ! I wish we had never come to this country.But , if it isn't the strikes and the revolutionaries , it's the earthquakes.Our operations here are finished !
__label__joy	I love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce . Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts . Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger ! Mmm ! Mmm ! It ’ s almost lunchtime . I would die for a plate of stir fry right now !
__label__joy	That's all thank you .
__label__joy	Alright . That's a good idea .
__label__joy	Great , here are some flowers for you . I hope you like them . I was not sure if the color will suit your new apartment .
__label__joy	Yeah ? That's what I was thinking too . Thanks .
__label__joy	It was wonderful , but I was so tired .
__label__joy	Yes , I would love to work on a special project !
__label__joy	That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
__label__joy	I'm glad you like it .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__surprise	I can hardly believe it .
__label__anger	But it was her that makes us so embarrassed .
__label__joy	Oh , you don ’ t have to do that but it would be a great help .
__label__joy	Do you think they two will get married ?
__label__sadness	Why did you tell me to get off ?
__label__joy	I hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time .
__label__surprise	Three thousand ! That's almost too good to be true . Did she say why her friend wants to sell it ?
__label__sadness	No can do ... sorry .
__label__joy	I love you home made apple pie . It ’ s delicious . Can I have another glass of lemonade as well ?
__label__joy	You can take me to the bank if you want to .
__label__surprise	how did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
__label__joy	I am calling to thank you for giving me the interview for the Sales Manager position yesterday
__label__sadness	Much better . My heart sank when Mary told me that she wanted to leave me .
__label__joy	Hello , Joanna . You are looking very charming in the new dress .
__label__joy	OK .
__label__joy	This could become a very expensive trip to be beauty parlour !
__label__disgust	It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife .
__label__joy	How have you been ?
__label__sadness	What a pity ! You can't join us .
__label__joy	That sounds fantastic ! What time is it playing ?
__label__joy	I see . Thank you .
__label__joy	Do you know that I fell in love with you at the first sight then ?
__label__joy	It's been a long time ! What's new ?
__label__joy	Thank you . It's lucky that I have got a good partner .
__label__joy	Not tonight . I promised to go to a concert with my sister .
__label__fear	Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do !
__label__joy	No ... He told me I'm pregnant !
__label__fear	Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up .
__label__sadness	I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages .
__label__surprise	Me ? Why me ? Why not you ?
__label__anger	Will you take my materials back from him for me ? Please !
__label__joy	I still have no idea what to do now .
__label__joy	I had my own ways of finding out.It ' s a secret . You look so beautiful today . Your new shirt goes well with your skirt .
__label__joy	I'm sure it will .
__label__joy	Okay , sir , here you are . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	That sounds perfect .
__label__joy	sounds good . I'll see you then !
__label__joy	You are welcome !
__label__joy	Would you like to book a table , sir ?
__label__joy	Ok . I ’ ll try my best to calm down first .
__label__joy	sure , I will be happy to bring a few , what is the address ?
__label__joy	This is going to be a major production for you !
__label__anger	Cash , credit card , cheque anything . I just have to see a doctor . I am in pain .
__label__joy	On balance , dress designing appeals to me most .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	I like the way the blinds give you privacy from the street .
__label__joy	Sure did . It's a beauty . Where do you want it ?
__label__joy	I have some good news for you . We've decided we'd like to send you to Shanghai on a business trip this weekend .
__label__joy	Yes , I'd love to.Here is a good one , Mozart and Beethoven.It ' s on the Festival Hall.Shall we go there ?
__label__joy	Oh , thank you so much .
__label__joy	This is delicious ! The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting ! I could have this everyday !
__label__fear	Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .
__label__joy	Great , is it a two bedroom house ?
__label__joy	That sounds like fun , but did you exercise ?
__label__joy	Well . In that case , we will have to go to another restaurant . Thank you all the same .
__label__joy	It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ?
__label__joy	Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	It's delicious .
__label__joy	Thank you.It was really a challenge to speak before such a large audience , you know .
__label__joy	Wen ! That's only a stereotype . Like all Asians are supposed to be math geniuses . I'm not a great dancer , and you said you failed calculus .
__label__surprise	Two , I hope and I hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me !
__label__joy	that's true . I could certainly use the exercise !
__label__joy	Good ! I'm interested in your advice .
__label__joy	Thank you for saying that .
__label__joy	What about April ? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot .
__label__joy	It's very nice of you to invite me .
__label__joy	Great , so are you going to sign a contract with them ?
__label__joy	That ’ s my wish .
__label__sadness	I will .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__sadness	Sorry , darling , I forgot .
__label__joy	A little bit . I have to go to sleep though I don't want to .
__label__joy	No , thank you . I'm afraid I can't take in anymore .
__label__joy	Your cooperation is very much appreciated .
__label__surprise	Really ? I heard it was supposed to be great .
__label__joy	Sure , let's . Goodbye , then .
__label__joy	It's most kind of you .
__label__sadness	So , this is the worst story I ’ Ve heard this month . You have my real sympathy , Tim .
__label__surprise	Oh , my wife just threw them into the washer .
__label__anger	How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong .
__label__joy	Here is $ 150.Keep the change .
__label__surprise	Yeah , very tasteful . And with them , you look even more fashionable . Oh , there are so many French perfumers . Oops , perfumes for guys ? So strange !
__label__joy	You are welcome .
__label__joy	No , thanks . I'm just looking .
__label__sadness	but I still love you .
__label__joy	That sounds fine .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Great idea ! I like authentic Chinese food .
__label__joy	Really ? Congratulations !
__label__joy	Oh , OK . Wow !
__label__joy	Let's go to the theater and buy two tickets now , shall we ?
__label__joy	See you at seven fifteen , Saturday .
__label__surprise	Really ! Did she tell you why she didn ’ t show up ?
__label__disgust	I just don't like my hair .
__label__anger	Whew ! I got the last one . This must be my lucky day !
__label__joy	Sure . I am free tomorrow . It sounds interesting to me . Can we buy the ticket online ?
__label__fear	Nobody told me that before .
__label__joy	Very well . We started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done . The only thing that isn ’ t ready yet is my wedding dress .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	I hope so . Then I ’ ll be the happiest person in our office too !
__label__surprise	So , what are you saying ? You ’ re breaking up with me because I ’ m perfect ?
__label__joy	It was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless !
__label__joy	great !
__label__surprise	What ? That would be to cut off your nose to spite your face .
__label__joy	I hope that I'll see you there .
__label__joy	Looks nice . Okay , I'll take it .
__label__joy	Okay , thanks a lot . You did me a great favor just now .
__label__joy	I like those too .
__label__joy	Thanks . You ’ d be ok on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ?
__label__joy	All right . I'll see you next time .
__label__joy	I find that every employee here respects that manager very much .
__label__joy	Great ! This calls for a celebration .
__label__surprise	Huh ? You mean you snuck a peek at his test ?
__label__joy	Do you feel like going to see a movie tonight ?
__label__surprise	Really ? I ’ d rather have the chicken feet to be honest .
__label__joy	Really ? How was it ?
__label__joy	I really appreciated it .
__label__joy	Would you like some more rice ?
__label__disgust	I ’ m so frustrated !
__label__anger	How dare you question my statement !
__label__joy	John , you have done a good job . Our new series computer is appreciated by the guests . They intend to sign contracts with our company . You really did a good job .
__label__joy	Yeah . I'm lucky to be his wife .
__label__joy	Thanks for the advice .
__label__joy	That ’ s true . I think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . I think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals .
__label__joy	I think we can go to the river , go around and have supper .
__label__joy	That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too .
__label__joy	Thanks . They look delicious .
__label__surprise	Oh , there is something wrong with my car .
__label__surprise	Oh , you mean Canal Street ?
__label__joy	Don't mention it .
__label__joy	I ’ m sure I will .
__label__joy	Thanks . That would be really helpful .
__label__joy	I know , but you deserve it .
__label__surprise	You did ? That's great ! You must be very happy now ?
__label__joy	Well , let's see which technique is better . I think I'll go up first ... Yes ! I hit a strike . I knocked them all down on my first bowl .
__label__joy	Can I hold it for a moment ?
__label__joy	It ’ s called Forex . Foreign Exchange . The great thing about it is that I don ’ t have to invest a huge amount . I put in a margin deposit and then I can buy and sell up to 100 times that much !
__label__joy	That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
__label__joy	We're all familiar with natural disasters . but we still feel weak when we face Wenchman earthquake .
__label__anger	You guys are charging me $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered or saw .
__label__joy	thank you . I can't imagine getting much done today . I'm just too exhausted !
__label__joy	Someone just robbed me .
__label__sadness	I'm afraid she's out .
__label__surprise	Really ? How come ?
__label__joy	Oh good ! Can I bring anything ?
__label__anger	You said the same thing three months ago .
__label__joy	That's a great idea . I'm going to do the same .
__label__joy	That would be great ! How about 2:30 ?
__label__disgust	Reciting texts really bores me to death .
__label__joy	I'm glad you like it.The bell is on the bedside.Just ring if you want anything.The room attendant speaks a little English.So I don't think you'll have any trouble .
__label__joy	wow ! That's really great news . How often does the magazine come out ?
__label__surprise	What !
__label__joy	No , thank you
__label__surprise	Really ? Have you won a fortune in the lottery ?
__label__joy	It is really exciting news .
__label__joy	Sounds like a good idea .
__label__joy	You're welcome . Let me know if you need anything else .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	OK , I'll give it a go .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__joy	I am so excited !
__label__sadness	I ’ m afraid not , Bob . One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted , causing major floods and landslides in the region . Meanwhile , Mexico ’ s coast has been hit by hurricane Liliana and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America , affecting Honduras , Guatemala and Panama . That ’ s all the news we have for today , but stay tuned for updates on the six o ’ clock news . Back to you Bob .
__label__joy	Sure , here you are .
__label__joy	We'd like to invite you over for dinner this Friday evening . Can you come ?
__label__joy	Goodbye .
__label__surprise	Oh , my god ! We get off at the wrong stop . I'm so sorry , honey .
__label__joy	I'd be very pleased .
__label__joy	Thank you so much . I appreciate your help .
__label__joy	I had a great time on the last date .
__label__joy	That was great . Thanks for taking me driving .
__label__joy	OK . I'll wait here for you .
__label__anger	I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me .
__label__surprise	You are saying he will be promoted to the general manager ?
__label__joy	I ’ m doing it ! I ’ m driving ! This is awesome ! Let ’ s turn some music on !
__label__joy	It ’ s a pleasure to meet you , Miss Green .
__label__joy	That should give us time for a cup of coffee . I'll go and get some .
__label__joy	this party rocks !
__label__joy	Good for you . Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world .
__label__joy	Oh , yes . It's amazing here . I don't think I ever want to go home again !
__label__joy	Thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ?
__label__joy	I agree . I appreciate your helping me .
__label__joy	This city is really comfortable to living .
__label__sadness	Well . It's not all my fault , Anna ...
__label__surprise	Eighty-five ? That's the best you can do ? I'll come back later ...
__label__surprise	Really ? Is he married ?
__label__joy	Whatever the reason may be , I'm glad you visited me .
__label__joy	Our computers have a high level of quality now.We can demonstrate it . And our prices will be good.So I think it will really be worthwhile .
__label__surprise	wow , that must have really been scary .
__label__disgust	You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ’ t sleep well . What ’ s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation .
__label__joy	What's your favorite flower ?
__label__sadness	But that still sounds expensive .
__label__joy	I really don't know how I can thank you enough .
__label__surprise	Really ? And what led you to this conclusion ?
__label__joy	That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ’ t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
__label__sadness	I ’ m really sorry , Mr . Samuel . I really don ’ t remember that .
__label__surprise	Thanks ! These are beautiful . You shouldn ’ t have !
__label__joy	Wow , that's my favorite . It's like a superman shooting right up into the sky .
__label__joy	Mmmm ... I know ! We can go to a really bad sci-fi movie and sit in the back of the theater and make fun of it . What do you think ?
__label__joy	From his looks , I'd say he's a man of character .
__label__joy	We ’ re glad that you ’ re here . Would you like a tour of the house ?
__label__joy	Should we go see it ?
__label__joy	Sure ! What do you feel like having ?
__label__joy	You got it ! I have a new job , I ’ m living in a new city , with new friends ! This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life .
__label__surprise	Really ? You didn't find a wallet ?
__label__surprise	Like me ? But you see I am so successful now . And if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future .
__label__sadness	I have said that we will try our best . You can trust us . But you know her situation .
__label__surprise	It is incredible .
__label__joy	Thank you , Peter .
__label__surprise	Johnny , I can't believe you would do that .
__label__joy	That ’ s great ! Do you have any plans ?
__label__anger	Oh great ! This stupid computer froze again ! That's the third time today ! Hey Samuel , can you come take a look at my PC ? It's acting again . It must have a virus or something .
__label__joy	Oh , speaking of the conductor , he is indeed a genius.He did a perfect job.His name is Menuhin , a descendent of Russian American immigrants .
__label__joy	It's so beautiful .
__label__joy	That's true .
__label__joy	Oh , man , look at her , go ! She is amazing ! She should be my sis .
__label__surprise	Yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go .
__label__joy	All right . Let's call it quits and go home .
__label__joy	May son adores my new hairstyle so I suppose it is worth it .
__label__joy	Yes , she is my favorite girl . I've decided to go steady with her .
__label__joy	Let's hope this stroke of good luck lasts . I hope we are over our financial difficulties for good .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	Wow , the view from the peak is so grand !
__label__joy	Yes , she's almost equal to Celine Dion when she sings .
__label__joy	Thanks for reminding me .
__label__surprise	Out ? What do you mean out ?
__label__sadness	I'm sorry man . I didn't know . I didn't mean to screw anything up .
__label__surprise	How come ?
__label__joy	Yes , Sunday sounds fine . What time ?
__label__joy	Great . One last question . Where is your jazz section ?
__label__surprise	Are you serious ?
__label__fear	I'm a little nervous .
__label__joy	You're welcome.Bye .
__label__joy	Thanks , I think so too .
__label__joy	Fantastic ! I got the promotion !
__label__anger	Did you hear what she said to me ?
__label__joy	It's very nice of you . I'll try my best to do my job well .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , sir . I'm going to have to ask you to leave .
__label__joy	That ’ s a good idea . She told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . I think it ’ s going to be a noisy party . I hope her neighbours don ’ t mind too much .
__label__joy	I am calling to inform you that we're happy to have you with us . Welcome aboard , I'm sure your friend would have given you a lot of information of our school and its motto , ways of teaching , etc .
__label__joy	You too.Bye .
__label__joy	Sure .
__label__joy	I think your speech was excellent .
__label__sadness	Oh , no .
__label__joy	OK . Thank you . Bye-bye .
__label__joy	Well , yes , I ’ d like to , if it ’ s not too much trouble .
__label__joy	I couldn't agree with you more .
__label__anger	I just told you , Debbie . I tried to call you twenty times !
__label__joy	Great ! I want a three piece suit , preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool .
__label__joy	how about this red dress ? I think it would really suit you .
__label__joy	I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . We just made a record sale this season .
__label__joy	Em , it's delicious !
__label__joy	Hello , Mr . Gao . We appreciate your letting us have the apartment .
__label__surprise	Really ? Who did you hear that from ?
__label__joy	That will be very nice . You're too kind .
__label__sadness	Hey , Cindy , I ’ m so sorry about yesterday . I shouldn ’ t have yelled at you in front of everyone .
__label__surprise	Why ? What's eating her ?
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__joy	Thank you so much for your assistance !
__label__joy	Maybe not , thank you all the same then .
__label__joy	Thank you very much . Come back to see us .
__label__joy	Mary , can I get Josh or you something to drink ?
__label__joy	Okay . Please take some fruit salad and crackers for me .
__label__joy	Take care of yourself and remember to keep in touch .
__label__joy	Sounds good . What should we see ?
__label__disgust	You ’ re missing the point . It ’ s about respect . He treats us with such a patronizing attitude , as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers . It ’ s his attitude that needs to be changed , not just his words .
__label__surprise	Yes , it is . Hi , Tom ! It's a real surprise to see you here .
__label__joy	Ok . Let ’ s go !
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome . Bye .
__label__joy	You do ?
__label__joy	Well , first of all , it ’ s much bigger . It has the same number of rooms , but each room is larger . We also have a larger garden , which our dog loves , of course !
__label__joy	You ’ re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ’ s you favourite award category ?
__label__joy	Excellent job .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	Sure . Anything to drink with that ?
__label__joy	Nice to meet you , I'am Seven . I don't think I ' Ve seen you around before .
__label__joy	Cool ! Can I come ?
__label__joy	It sounds interesting . Can I go and see it ?
__label__joy	They're neat . Now Let's take that path into the woods and see what we can see ...
__label__joy	Fine . I miss you so much , uncle Benjamin .
__label__joy	Here's to our friendship and health !
__label__joy	Congratulations ! That's really something beyond my imagination .
__label__joy	Ok then . See you next weekend .
__label__joy	Your budget is a good idea .
__label__surprise	Yes ! How do you know that ?
__label__joy	Thank you . I think we may be able to work together in the future .
__label__joy	That's exactly what I want , thank you .
__label__joy	It's excellent .
__label__joy	It's very nice . I'd like to purchase this refrigerator .
__label__anger	This isn't fair .
__label__joy	Wow . That girl who brings the fruit is really pretty ! I wish she wouldn't have rushed off so fast ...
__label__sadness	I've searched everywhere . Where on earth did I put it ?
__label__surprise	You don't know what happened ?
__label__surprise	Really ? Why ?
__label__joy	If you wait a minute I can go with you .
__label__joy	That's great . I thought you said you didn't get the job .
__label__joy	Sure . No problem .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot . What I ’ ll do si find out more online and drop by next week .
__label__joy	Thanks . I really appreciate that .
__label__joy	Yes . I feel refreshed .
__label__joy	If you had a box made in the ' 20s , that would be nice .
__label__joy	It's just a system like ours , with a star and a number of planets going around it .
__label__surprise	Okay , we'll put it in the trunk . Ah , it is so heavy .
__label__joy	Yeah , good idea.We can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill . I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot .
__label__joy	Good . How much does it come to ?
__label__joy	At 8 o'clock . I will make the reservation .
__label__joy	Wow , you're right . Everything is absolutely delicious . Please pass the pepper .
__label__joy	Lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__surprise	Do people usually buy frozen vegetables in your country , it ’ s very rare in mine .
__label__anger	Just what I thought !
__label__joy	Thanks . That would be very helpful .
__label__joy	Okay .
__label__disgust	That guy's manner really turns me off .
__label__surprise	Hey , that ’ s not the girl with pink hair , is it ? The girl I saw with Jack yesterday .
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? Do you know why ?
__label__joy	Me too . I like the festival best of all .
__label__joy	That'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ?
__label__joy	No , I have visited China several times , but it's my first visit to Beijing and I think it's a great honor to be invited to your beautiful city .
__label__joy	Great ! Do you need me to sign anything ?
__label__joy	That sounds great . Have you been to the top of the Pearl Tower ?
__label__joy	Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know .
__label__joy	I'm sure and I remembered your phone number . I'll call you .
__label__surprise	Oh , boy . His wife can't be happy about that .
__label__joy	oh ! Hey , look , that's the same shirt Britney wore in her concert .
__label__surprise	Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ?
__label__sadness	Yes , it was . I managed to sort out the problem , but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour .
__label__joy	I believe that you can make your dream come true .
__label__joy	Of course , it is a nice song that can make audience calm and pleasant .
__label__joy	I'll tell him . Thanks for asking about him .
__label__sadness	It was the same as the last place I worked at . I was hoping you ’ d be different .
__label__joy	Hey , you can dance to rap music !
__label__joy	Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ?
__label__joy	Mechwarrior is such a good game . The graphics are awesome !
__label__joy	OK . I have a good pair of hiking boots . It should not be a big problem .
__label__joy	So sorry . Next time we'll go , thanks anyway .
__label__joy	It's a great idea . I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier . Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed .
__label__joy	Sounds good . What do we need to bring ?
__label__joy	It looks new .
__label__anger	Peter , it's a quarter to twelve . Let's go home now !
__label__joy	Good , I can see the library on the map .
__label__joy	I know doctor , thank you so much .
__label__joy	Wow ! It is huge and you can do many activities here .
__label__anger	Don ’ t be kidding , OK ?
__label__joy	That's good for me , but do you think you'll be back by then ? I'd really like to see you .
__label__joy	it is full of energy .
__label__joy	Maybe later . I wanna take some photos first .
__label__joy	Thanks for your hospitality .
__label__joy	Good .
__label__disgust	Working at weekend is something I hate to do most .
__label__joy	Darlene ! Indeed , it ’ s been a while ! How have you been ? Wow , you look amazing ! I love what you ’ Ve done with your hair !
__label__joy	Of course and very well .
__label__anger	But I ended up with finding out lady that night , that you were with other girl at cafe near your home .
__label__joy	Many thanks !
__label__anger	My roommate always brings a lot of friends from off-campus . They stay in the room until midnight , singing and talking , drinking and playing cards while I have no place for study . I even don't have the quietness to sleep .
__label__surprise	really ? That ’ s fantastic . What kind of business is it ?
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	Sure . It's probably a skiing show . Adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
__label__joy	Yes . At first sight .
__label__joy	If there's ever anything I can do for you , Don't hesitate to let me know .
__label__joy	Nice to meet you !
__label__joy	I just won the lottery .
__label__surprise	What ? I sent you three or four messages !
__label__anger	What about my rights ?
__label__joy	Come and sit down . Would you like a drink ?
__label__joy	You know in China we usually don't open presents until the guests leave .
__label__joy	At the gate of the park .
__label__joy	I'll take care of the lunch then , and you can take care of the other plans . What time would you like to pick me up ?
__label__joy	Happy New Year , Bill .
__label__joy	OK .
__label__joy	I know , they look very similar .
__label__joy	It includes a lot of useful words and phrases .
__label__anger	Yes , it is annoying .
__label__joy	It ’ s so nice and quiet in the woods .
__label__joy	I'll think about it .
__label__joy	I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ?
__label__joy	Thanks for your understanding .
__label__joy	Don ’ t worry . I will arrange everything .
__label__surprise	What ? Huh ?
__label__joy	How about Sunday then ?
__label__joy	Barbara . But please , just call me Barb .
__label__surprise	Huh ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	The leopard print sounds fabulous . OK , I'll take it .
__label__disgust	You are not funny either . I can't believe I married a woman like you .
__label__sadness	I drew a blank on the algebra test .
__label__joy	Yes . I ’ Ve won the first prize in the math contest .
__label__joy	You have a real talent , Ellen !
__label__joy	Not at all .
__label__joy	My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer , and I suppose you dance often .
__label__surprise	But my sister bought this pair last month .
__label__joy	I had a great time too and was thinking that maybe you might want to join me for a hike to the waterfalls on Saturday .
__label__joy	That's what everyone says ! I can't wait to see it for myself some day .
__label__joy	I ’ m excited to speak to a candidate .
__label__joy	Oh , good . That'll be the number forty four ?
__label__sadness	Oh , no , I'm afraid not . These things are just too old to guarantee anything .
__label__joy	Yes , they can . If you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat .
__label__joy	Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try .
__label__joy	No problem at all ! I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
__label__joy	How about going hunting with me ?
__label__surprise	Really ? What time and which restaurant ?
__label__joy	( Smile ) I can ’ t believe this for it ’ s been 20 years since we got married .
__label__surprise	Only $ 29.95 ? I'll buy it , of course .
__label__joy	Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do .
__label__joy	OK , here you are .
__label__surprise	Kate , you never believe what's happened .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	I'll pick you up around 8: 00 .
__label__joy	Thank you . See you later .
__label__surprise	Wow , it's surprising . So what do I get ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	I'm glad you came . You're welcome anytime .
__label__joy	My pleasure .
__label__joy	What a coincidence ! These pajamas would be perfect to take along on the honeymoon !
__label__disgust	I'm really tired of my job in the bank . I'm thinking about changing it .
__label__surprise	You ’ Ve been wasting your time on this ? I can ’ t believe it ! It doesn ’ t even look fun or challenging !
__label__surprise	Really ? Why ?
__label__joy	It ' s an Indian restaurant ! I know you have never had Indian food , so I thought you might want to try .
__label__joy	Yes . Hey , I've got some photos of our holiday in Ireland . Would you like to see them ?
__label__joy	Hey , May . How about getting together for a movie tonight ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__sadness	I'm glad to help you . But what is it you want to ask about ?
__label__joy	While staying in love is even better .
__label__joy	What a beautiful view we have here .
__label__joy	Good night !
__label__joy	OK . Wait for a moment , please .
__label__joy	It is special , isn't it ?
__label__joy	Yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ?
__label__joy	yes , I'll be promoted to department manager .
__label__anger	Oh , shut up , will you ? It was all your fault . If you'd kept quite this would never have happened .
__label__surprise	Can you tell that I ’ m excited ?
__label__joy	There is a snowman over there .
__label__joy	that sounds like fun .
__label__joy	What a wonderful neighborhood ! Can you find that house on our Open House list ?
__label__anger	I'm going crazy .
__label__joy	It sounds like a really exciting city to live in .
__label__joy	You have made a poor meal . Let me get you some more fish .
__label__disgust	You mean that I won't get a raise until the recession ends ?
__label__joy	Thank you . How much is it ?
__label__joy	You really are lucky !
__label__joy	I love anything with chocolate the best .
__label__joy	No doubt , it's not a simple thing to put on a ' phantom show ' .
__label__sadness	Sorry .
__label__joy	I'm okay . He just stole my things .
__label__joy	See you tomorrow .
__label__sadness	Sorry , darling , I forgot .
__label__joy	Hey ! Look at this ! We can stay in a big hotel or we can stay in a little cabin by the beach .
__label__joy	Congratulations on your success .
__label__joy	A playpen and crib ! Thanks Carla ! This is just what I needed !
__label__joy	You ’ Ve been very helpful .
__label__sadness	Of course not . I knew she had fallen in love with another guy . It is difficult to see her move on so quickly .
__label__surprise	No . That ’ s what is surprising me .
__label__joy	Goodbye . Hope to see you again .
__label__sadness	Oh , sir . I lost my passport .
__label__joy	Of course . There you are .
__label__joy	Guess what came in the mail today ?
__label__joy	Hi , Tom . How have you been ?
__label__joy	Sure . I will .
__label__joy	What a nice day !
__label__joy	Oh , are you ? That sounds interesting .
__label__joy	Happy birthday , Ms . Lin . Here is a present for you .
__label__joy	Oh , I will have a sweet dream .
__label__joy	That's terrific !
__label__sadness	It ’ s getting worse . Now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . I ’ Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw .
__label__joy	It's great ! I like these places .
__label__joy	May I ask you for a dance ?
__label__surprise	really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime .
__label__joy	Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us .
__label__sadness	I should've just stayed on the bus .
__label__joy	Let me guess , Mocha , Mandheling , and Santos !
__label__joy	Sounds good . What time do you want me to come ?
__label__joy	Just give me $ 55 .
__label__joy	That's a good idea . But leave the front as it is now .
__label__joy	Sure . I ’ ll also take some silver cuff link and a pair of silk ties .
__label__joy	Ha , yes , brilliant !
__label__joy	Yeah , it costed a bundle , alright ?
__label__joy	Thank you for you help .
__label__joy	The same to you , Joey .
__label__sadness	I know . I'll get over him . My first break up was painful because I was naive .
__label__joy	Come on , it's the weekend . Let's taste and enjoy this meal . Cheers !
__label__joy	I've been chosen to plan the next family reunion .
__label__joy	No , it's just perfect .
__label__joy	Well , congratulations . When is the big date ?
__label__joy	Perfect ! I like this one .
__label__joy	You're going to like him . Everybody says he's a nice guy .
__label__joy	I like talking to you too .
__label__joy	Sounds good .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	You're looking great .
__label__joy	Say , why don't you come with us ? We have plenty of room .
__label__joy	Good . I wanna come with you .
__label__joy	It is a bit expensive . But it is worth buying one's favorite . I will take them .
__label__joy	Good idea , especially at this price .
__label__joy	He must be very easy-going .
__label__disgust	They killed another hostage .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry I'm late .
__label__sadness	I don't know . She always said I didn't love her , but I did .
__label__surprise	Oh , my God . Do you want to be a millionaire ? I can see you are very crazy about money .
__label__anger	Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?
__label__joy	Aw , come on ; it was nothing . I'm just doing my job .
__label__sadness	I ’ m sorry , Mr . Baker ’ s not in . May I take your message ?
__label__joy	Okay , thank you very much for your help .
__label__anger	I've something very unpleasant to talk with you . Upon the arrival of the first consignment , it was found that about 50 % of the sixty cases of pineapples were leaking .
__label__surprise	What ? But it is my favorite piece of clothing .
__label__surprise	What a find ! So , how much does it cost ?
__label__surprise	Oh , my computer crashed again !
__label__joy	Of course.No girl is more charming .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Everything is great , Tad . How are you ?
__label__joy	No problem . I'll talk to you later .
__label__sadness	Well , I am under a lot of pressure . My boss is very pushy . He assigned me three projects . Now the deadlines are near , and I still have not finished all of my projects .
__label__joy	It is the symbol of laughing at hoar frost and fighting with snow . I admire the bravery of plum blossoms .
__label__joy	I'll do that , Mr.Zhang , See you tomorrow .
__label__sadness	I ’ m sorry you didn ’ t get accepted .
__label__joy	I think I am getting a fever and will be too sick to help you . Here , feel how hot my head is !
__label__joy	I think I'm going to like it here .
__label__joy	Good ! And then , the entire body . Never incline your body forward or backward . Take care to regulate the point of balance . Place it at your waist .
__label__disgust	I have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . I feel exhausted .
__label__joy	Thanks John , and there you have it ! Looks like it ’ s a weekend to stay at home !
__label__anger	You should've been done already .
__label__joy	I think it is amazing . You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway .
__label__joy	Surely , I'll have one made for you . You want a print ?
__label__joy	Is 5 PM . a good time for you ?
__label__joy	Yeah . All of us tried our best .
__label__joy	Follow me into the kitchen . You will love it .
__label__disgust	Well , it would be a lot easier to finish if you stopped talking to me .
__label__surprise	really ? so you don't have fried food at all .
__label__joy	Yes , of course , Mr Peters ! Good to see you again . What can we do for you today ?
__label__joy	OK . Thank you .
__label__joy	you always have unique ideas and you're such a team leader .
__label__joy	Ice cream , please .
__label__joy	That ’ s great . We can go boating on the lake in the afternoon .
__label__anger	Don't bother .
__label__joy	thanks . I better get back to my work before my boss yells at me again !
__label__joy	It's pretty . How much is it ?
__label__joy	Absolutely . Through all kinds of stamps I am able to learn about the world .
__label__joy	Thank you very much , bye !
__label__joy	Yes , simple as it is . It does work .
__label__joy	Let me show you the way . Please follow me .
__label__joy	The counselors were so nice too . It was the best summer ever . Except for all those mosquitoes !
__label__joy	There's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight .
__label__joy	Good idea !
__label__joy	Thank you , Lisa .
__label__sadness	I'm afraid I can only rent it for two months .
__label__joy	you have good fashion sense , Karen .
__label__sadness	Oh . I made a mistake . I thought the guy on the right was Peckham .
__label__joy	Well , I won't keep you then . It was very nice of you to come to see me .
__label__surprise	No way !
__label__joy	So quick and easy ! Thanks very much .
__label__joy	It's very nice.It goes well with your skirt .
__label__joy	You should . I know you'll like it .
__label__joy	OK . Dinner and a movie will be perfect .
__label__joy	Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ?
__label__joy	Yeah , and I love your cooking .
__label__joy	See you tonight then .
__label__joy	I could not agree with you more . For us , there are so many unhappy things and I am so bored ; however , I got lots of fun from stealing .
__label__joy	I see . Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	That's good to know . Oh , listen ! The band's playing our song .
__label__joy	Why not ?
__label__joy	I have some good news for you . We've decided we'd like to send you to Shanghai on a business trip this weekend .
__label__joy	You were really lucky .
__label__joy	I like the apartment , Mr.Sellers . You can show me the lease .
__label__joy	You are welcome .
__label__surprise	Okay.Hey , is that a dark cloud over there ? Do you think it will rain after all ?
__label__joy	Well , doctors are such an important job . I mean your health is the most imponent thing you've got , isn't it ? I want to be important and help people .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	Are you hungry ? Do you want me to buy something for you to eat ?
__label__joy	That ’ s correct . It ’ s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in Florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case .
__label__joy	See you !
__label__joy	You look happy .
__label__joy	Welcome ! Sophia told us you were coming !
__label__joy	Thank you for your delicious meal .
__label__surprise	Why ! what happened ?
__label__joy	Thank you . I'll have a try .
__label__joy	It really must be an exciting time for you guys .
__label__sadness	Well , no . I thought I ‘ Ve finish in five minutes . and I didn ’ t want to be difficult about just few minutes , if I hadn ’ t been missing the bus and in the traffic I wouldn ’ t have been so late . I ’ m sorry .
__label__joy	That would be great ! Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That ’ s assuming you don ’ t mind if I call you sometime .
__label__joy	Well then , this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . I bet you'd love it .
__label__joy	Thanks.Let me see . I think there's a mistake on the bill here.Would you mind checking , please ?
__label__joy	Hi , I'm home ! Can you double that recipe ? I ran into an old friend after work and invited him for dinner .
__label__sadness	Oh , I'm sorry .
__label__joy	I guess that does sound a lot healthier .
__label__joy	Thanks , that's would be lovely . You'r right , he is kind and nice looking .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	Yes.Oh , it's you , Linda . I haven't seen you for a long time.Well , come in and sit down.How about something to drink ?
__label__joy	Hi ! I'm happy you could make it .
__label__surprise	Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will bec
__label__surprise	You mean I have to wear the same thing every day ? MOM !
__label__joy	Yes , you have a good eye for materials .
__label__anger	You ’ Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ?
__label__joy	Oh , that's so nice of you ! Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Sure . I can see you're enjoying your trip today .
__label__joy	I appreciate that .
__label__anger	It ’ s so wet and dark , I ’ m just fed up .
__label__joy	that'd be great ! I know he'd appreciate your help .
__label__joy	No other city can match it . It's heaven .
__label__surprise	Really ? That ’ s unusual .
__label__surprise	Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive .
__label__sadness	I am sorry . I didn ’ t accomplish the job on time .
__label__joy	Fine , well the job search tools are all here for you to use . Feel free to look around and use what works best for you . Have fun with it !
__label__joy	Well , I ’ Ve been working so hard lately , so I ’ ll probably just take it easy .
__label__joy	Wow , you are the expert on it .
__label__joy	That ’ s great news !
__label__joy	Thank you very much for your cooperation .
__label__joy	Oh , look at that beautiful countertop material and the double sink !
__label__anger	Oh , gag me ! She's totally gross !
__label__joy	Good news . Ah , what if be even better if alternative work place is provided .
__label__joy	That's a good idea . Why have I never thought of that ?
__label__joy	Happy birthday , Aims !
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__joy	Pretty good . Actually , I'm quite busy with work . By the way , say ' hello ' to your husband .
__label__joy	We open at 6:30 , sir .
__label__joy	It's hard to say , because each team has my idols .
__label__joy	Good . Let's take a look !
__label__joy	I certainly can try ... No ! It went straight through the wickets .
__label__joy	Yes , I like travelling . I am young , and unmarried . It ’ s no problem for me to travel frequently .
__label__joy	I'm free tomorrow .
__label__anger	And we ’ ll all help you .
__label__joy	Fine .
__label__joy	My brother started investing money when he was 16 years old .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Then keep up the good work .
__label__joy	There is a new restaurant opening up in town next month .
__label__sadness	now that I look back at it , it wawsn't that big a deal . I shouldn't have lost my temper .
__label__joy	They are.We definitely see eye-to eye on my enhanced performance being a win-win situation for everyone involved .
__label__joy	Here's your change . Thank you for shopping with us .
__label__joy	It must be old .
__label__joy	It ’ s wonderful , isn ’ t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I look recently ?
__label__joy	I used to buy lunch every day from the International food stall at school . Every day was an adventure !
__label__joy	I think that might work for me as well .
__label__joy	It ’ s my pleasure . Would you like another glass of champagne ?
__label__joy	Yeah , I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car . It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself .
__label__joy	Please let me know when you go to China and let me be of some assistance to you .
__label__surprise	Don't tell me you're a salsa expert , too !
__label__joy	congratulations ! That's excellent news ? What do you have to do to get an unconditional offer ?
__label__joy	Yes , that is me . Nice to meet you , Monica . Welcome on board !
__label__joy	Yes . I bought two boxed of chocolate – one for me and one for you !
__label__joy	I have had a good stay here . Your service is wonderful . I'm very satisfied with it .
__label__joy	I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday ?
__label__surprise	So what happened ?
__label__joy	Don't worry about it .
__label__joy	That sounds fine .
__label__joy	I visited the First International Flower Festival in the city last year , and was impressed with so many beautiful flowers !
__label__joy	That's a big question . Well , if you're in love , maybe you will take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all .
__label__anger	It is . Hurry up ! You ’ ll be late for school .
__label__anger	He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway !
__label__joy	Fine.We ' ll be expecting you .
__label__joy	A piece of cake ?
__label__joy	Oh , sorry sir . We take no tips here . Thank you all the same .
__label__joy	No . How about going to karaoke tonight ?
__label__joy	I will . Thanks a lot .
__label__surprise	He is really terrific !
__label__joy	Yes , that's my only day off until Thursday .
__label__joy	That'd be great ! Thank you .
__label__joy	Yes !
__label__joy	Maybe we all should learn something from him .
__label__joy	Oh thanks for inviting me . I'd love to come .
__label__joy	That's the spirit . I'll see you tomorrow after class .
__label__anger	That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch .
__label__joy	Thank you . I will deal with it .
__label__joy	All right . Let's chat next time . Bye-bye .
__label__surprise	Really ? Can't you stay a little longer ?
__label__surprise	Really ? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot .
__label__surprise	Is that so ? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind . Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years . We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten . Have you any evidence ?
__label__anger	But I ’ m not able to live here anymore .
__label__disgust	Oh ! I hate rainy days !
__label__joy	It feels very good .
__label__surprise	Wow , so soon ! I'm going to miss you .
__label__sadness	Doctor , my child is nine years old , and I recently found that he was constantly telling lies about how he is doing at school .
__label__surprise	Really ? Do you like the story ? It's sheer nonsense !
__label__joy	OK . How about some spring rolls and squid balls , some pork skins , and some beer !
__label__joy	I think I ’ m crazy about her .
__label__surprise	Never ? Really ? I'm surprised .
__label__joy	Great . I have a good day , thanks again for the offer .
__label__joy	Then , put on your casual clothes and pack some food and beverages .
__label__joy	Ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great .
__label__joy	Oh . that's very nice of him .
__label__joy	Ok . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Ok , you are really all eyes when it comes to talking about food , aren't you ?
__label__joy	That is the most beautiful sunset !
__label__joy	Fine . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	I am so happy to know that I could make some contribution to our company .
__label__joy	Yeah . I have got much pressure in the company . I have tobe wrapped upon my work .
__label__joy	I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour .
__label__joy	I thought it was pretty good .
__label__joy	No problem . Good luck .
__label__joy	Thanks . Wendy . There will be an important dinner party tonight . So I must make me the focus of my friends .
__label__joy	Yes , my wife is coming to get me .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place !
__label__joy	Wow !
__label__joy	It doesn't matter .
__label__fear	I turned on my laptop and it broke ! I mean , the monitor went black !
__label__sadness	Yes , but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
__label__joy	Definitely , it's time to say bye-bye to the last year and to say hello to the new year !
__label__joy	Oh , buddy , you are so kind . Thank you !
__label__anger	How slowly you drive !
__label__joy	May I invite you for a dance ?
__label__sadness	Don't worry . Anyway , you are better than me .
__label__anger	Mike , you're late again .
__label__sadness	She said it was because we had very different ideas about life .
__label__sadness	I am awfully sorry . I didn't think you would mind so much .
__label__joy	I have lemonade , iced tea , and mango juice .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , sir , but may I see your driver's licence and insurance policy , please ? I have to give you a ticket .
__label__joy	You will be very beautiful on your wedding day .
__label__sadness	We're sorry you have to leave .
__label__sadness	I'm afraid I can't .
__label__joy	The rooms are very tidy and the flowers grew very well.You are very helpful . I want to thank you for everything you've done for me .
__label__joy	It looks so cute . Is it a parrot ?
__label__joy	Oh , really . I like hot food . So what is your recommendation for me ?
__label__joy	Yes , I think so . It's very emotional .
__label__joy	The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting .
__label__joy	Sure , Carolyn . I'm happy to help you.What kinds of things do you need right now ?
__label__joy	Be sure to get to the sports hall at nine o'clock on Sunday morning .
__label__joy	How about at the subway entrance .
__label__joy	It's a pleasure .
__label__joy	I ’ m happy that you find this apartment so appealing .
__label__joy	That would be great .
__label__joy	Listen to the sound of nature ! It's like music .
__label__joy	Good . I'm a regular customer here . I am glad you can make an exception for me .
__label__joy	Congratulations ! I heard that you are going to take a two-week training course in the headquarter .
__label__joy	Here comes the birthday cake .
__label__joy	Wow ! Congratulation ! When do classes start ?
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , sir .
__label__joy	Fine , thank you .
__label__joy	Thank you for bringing me here . What shall we order ?
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	Good , happy birthday to you !
__label__joy	That ’ s great . Can you do it anywhere ?
__label__surprise	Are you interested in science ? I can't believe it .
__label__joy	Okay , thanks for everything .
__label__joy	When Jo and I are together , we argue a lot , but that's also part of the fun . Besides , I know she will always be there for me when I need her , and she knows I'll be there for her .
__label__joy	Thank you . I just consider working as part of my life .
__label__anger	Excuse me . This chicken doesn't taste right to me .
__label__joy	Hi , Jason ! Long time no see . How's the hotel ?
__label__joy	All right ! Thank you .
__label__joy	Come on in . Would you care for a drink ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__disgust	Many people say it's a good story.But I think it's boring !
__label__anger	Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball !
__label__sadness	Yeah . My whole GPA is screwed up now .
__label__joy	Typical Francis , whether you are at work , or engaged in leisure time activities , you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself .
__label__joy	Thank you very much . I had a really good time .
__label__joy	Thank you !
__label__joy	So what am I going to do ?
__label__sadness	I knew this would happen some day ...
__label__joy	What is it ?
__label__joy	How do you like waltz ?
__label__joy	It's great !
__label__disgust	Wow , that terrible movie is finally over . Next time I ’ m picking the film , because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick .
__label__sadness	Sorry , I'm late .
__label__joy	How about next time we meet at my place ? And I ’ ll treat you to Chinese food . I know how much you like it . We can order in and watch video too . Anything you like , I promise .
__label__joy	Great ! I have a coupon for free popcorn at that theater !
__label__sadness	I'm afraid not , unless you want a night flight .
__label__joy	Thanks . Maybe I will do business through Internet in the future .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	Wasn't that football game great ! I just knew we'd win !
__label__joy	All right . I ’ ll see you on Friday .
__label__joy	You've been so helpful . Thank you .
__label__joy	What should I bring with me ?
__label__joy	You're right . I should talk to him . Sometimes , it's not easy being a parent . Thanks . It helps to get it off my chest . You're always so easy to talk to .
__label__surprise	You have never gone to the Statue of Liberty ? ! I can't believe it ! But you live here !
__label__joy	I like to stay here .
__label__joy	Aright . Do you have any cigarettes ?
__label__joy	Will you be okay when you immigrate to America ?
__label__joy	All right . Goodbye , Dave .
__label__joy	That sounds great !
__label__sadness	Sorry , I dialed the wrong number .
__label__joy	Ok , I'll try that .
__label__joy	Not at all .
__label__joy	Okay , I ’ Ve decided . I ’ m going to pop the question !
__label__joy	yes , but with our sense we'll always look good .
__label__joy	Are you going to the movie theater with me tonight ?
__label__joy	Looking forward to meeting with you !
__label__joy	I really love you .
__label__joy	Wow . That's really good.And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ?
__label__joy	Oh , I think I should try to read one .
__label__sadness	That's kind of you to say . But ... the stuff we do here hasn't really challenged me very much at all .
__label__joy	This title does not only give you a raising pay-check , but also increase responsibilities . Congratulations , and hope the best for you .
__label__joy	I cann't wait for buying his CD now .
__label__joy	Good ! Here , let me help you with your bag . Is it your first time to Seattle ? I'd be happy to take you around this city and show you the sights tonight if you're up to it .
__label__joy	That's a good idea .
__label__joy	Yes , no problem . It'll be ready by 2 p . m .
__label__sadness	When he told me I had to work overtime , that was it .
__label__joy	Thanks , but actually I was hoping I could ask you to write my biography .
__label__joy	Ok . I ’ ll take it .
__label__sadness	Sorry . You'd better get off for taking another taxi .
__label__surprise	Really ? This is a nice office , but it's quite small .
__label__surprise	Like that Rastafarian over there ? You mean dreadlocks ? You crazy ! That'll take way too long .
__label__joy	It smells sweet .
__label__joy	The night life there . It's so romantic !
__label__surprise	25 cents a day ?
__label__joy	The notification period of my current job is not that long and I ’ m quite profession to English and I am happy with the traveling abroad as I ’ m good dealing with the people from other cultures . It makes the whole job even more interesting . I will send my resume to you still this week .
__label__joy	That's great !
__label__joy	Glad to meet you , Wang Lin . I am Mary .
__label__joy	All kinds , but mostly Pop , rock and classical . Why ?
__label__sadness	Sorry , sir , you have to pay in the check-out counter . It's there .
__label__joy	It's a bit small but looks nice.What ' s more , it's only ten minutes ' walk to the company .
__label__surprise	Definitely . It's a wonderful meal . Thank you , Honey .
__label__joy	The beans will burn . I know . I've tasted burnt coffee before ... yuck !
__label__surprise	Why ? it doesn't make sense . If we do the floors first , and then paint the walls , we will get paint all over our new floor .
__label__joy	Sounds like fun .
__label__surprise	Unbelievable ! I could never do that .
__label__joy	Thank you so much .
__label__surprise	Really ? How many collections do you have ?
__label__joy	Don't mention it . Good luck . You're going to need it .
__label__joy	Yeah , you are right . I must stop complaining and stick to it every day .
__label__joy	I have chosen January as the month for this retreat .
__label__joy	It's great ! Will it be hard to care for ?
__label__joy	You know , that is one of my favorites !
__label__joy	Hello , my name is Paula . Nice to meet you !
__label__joy	Look at the snow , it's so beautiful .
__label__joy	He's honest , hardworking and responsible . I simply can't find any shortcoming of his as an employee .
__label__joy	There ’ s you receipt . Goodbye .
__label__surprise	Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .
__label__joy	that's very sensible . Would it be alright if I left early today to prepare for the trip ?
__label__surprise	Whoa ! That's expensive ! It should be cheaper .
__label__joy	Mike , come and look at this painting of shrimp ! It is so simple yet so vivid !
__label__joy	Have you ever swum in a river or a lake ?
__label__joy	Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .
__label__joy	Sure .
__label__anger	Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars !
__label__joy	Thanks . That'll be all .
__label__joy	I am very happy to know my work could be recognized by you and our company .
__label__joy	absolutely . I can decide when and what to do all by myself .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you .
__label__joy	Okay , thin crust . Your total is $ 21.50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it ’ s free !
__label__joy	Thanks , that was nice of you .
__label__surprise	Next week ?
__label__joy	Thanks a lot . Good bye .
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? Do you know which company it's from ?
__label__joy	What time should we meet ?
__label__joy	Thank you . I appreciate all your help .
__label__joy	Let's plan a surprise party for him !
__label__sadness	A guy in my office got the flu the other day . Today I seem to have come down with it , too .
__label__joy	Really ? Have you ever been there ?
__label__joy	Oh , let's come in and enjoy yourself .
__label__joy	No , I'm fine . Thanks .
__label__fear	He makes me nervous . He looks at me funny . And he never buys anything !
__label__joy	Mmmm . .. OK , let's try to be .
__label__joy	Yes , It's very great .
__label__joy	Ok , cool .
__label__joy	I went out with Leo last night . It was really exciting .
__label__joy	Well , I've been looking forward to seeing you .
__label__joy	Certainly.Here you are.They ' re the very latest fashion .
__label__joy	We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement .
__label__joy	Perfect . I ’ ll pick you up then .
__label__joy	I forgot what I put up with . In that case , I do deserve these flowers .
__label__sadness	You don't have to keep saying that , Yuri . It's not your fault.But me--I'm the one who should be sorry.It was me who suggested operations here in the first place ! Oh , what can we do ?
__label__joy	All right , see you .
__label__anger	Don ’ t criticize Mario or else I ’ ll start on those fat , drunk friends of yours ; they ’ re no saints .
__label__joy	No way ! That sounds great !
__label__joy	I hope so . Thank you .
__label__joy	Really ? That's wonderful !
__label__joy	I ’ m glad you like it .
__label__joy	Then I'll take it .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Thanks for your help .
__label__joy	OK . We look forward to seeing you . Goodbye .
__label__joy	Let's go !
__label__anger	That's absolutely ridiculous !
__label__anger	You should at least give me a call .
__label__joy	Rachel , do you like music ?
__label__joy	Good . I think I'll get too nervous to look at myself in the mirror !
__label__joy	I think that the apple crisp would be wonderful .
__label__joy	It sounds wonderful . Do I have to sign a lease ? How much should I pay ?
__label__joy	Let ’ s go then .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__surprise	It is ? Oh , that ’ s nice .
__label__joy	It tastes like crankcase oil , but delicious .
__label__joy	Look at the ticket booth in the center . There seems to be not as many people as we thought it would be .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	I just got a letter from an old high school buddy .
__label__joy	I'm glad you guys all have such a good sense of humor . Ha-ha ...
__label__joy	Thanks for the invitation . I will !
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__disgust	We waste a vacation .
__label__joy	Bye , Jason .
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? are there any snakes ?
__label__joy	Well , it ’ s very comfortable just to drift here .
__label__joy	The Taj it is then .
__label__joy	There is a beautiful state park here . I can see why so many people come out here to camp .
__label__joy	Really going to miss you .
__label__joy	13924774026 . All right . Thanks for calling . Oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on .
__label__surprise	John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ?
__label__joy	If you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time .
__label__sadness	Yes , I kept on typing it until midnight , but it is lost .
__label__joy	Thank you . I ’ Ve really enjoyed my time here . I've grown both personally and professionally with this company .
__label__anger	Susan ! Why didn ’ t you tell me that you were taking over the Silk Company account ?
__label__surprise	How silly of you to jump out of the window !
__label__joy	Good morning , Mr . Thomas , it is nice to see you too .
__label__joy	Don't mention it .
__label__joy	We are on the high way . Find the pound shade ..
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the words so there are lots of very expensive places .
__label__joy	Yeah , I will be there .
__label__joy	The coffee , books , music and sunshine are just beautiful there .
__label__joy	So cool . I wish I can go to the live New Year's Concert someday in the future .
__label__joy	Great ! You are all set to enjoy the library .
__label__joy	Well , hi ! My name is Eve Markowski . I am glad to meet you . With your friendly smile and helpful attitude . I am sure you will win .
__label__joy	Thanks for your help .
__label__joy	That's great . I'll tell my mother about it .
__label__surprise	How dare you say that ? What they do is just for our good .
__label__joy	Yes , I couldn't agree with you more . A 1 year time deposit it is !
__label__anger	Why don't you watch where you're going ?
__label__joy	That's great .
__label__joy	Well , every stamp has a story to tell .
__label__joy	Nice to see you , Patrick .
__label__joy	See you soon ! Bye ! Egg ... I can ’ t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter .
__label__joy	Man , that's amazing . It must have cost a bundle .
__label__surprise	Really ? So what ’ s the news ?
__label__joy	let ’ s go together .
__label__joy	Let's line up . The steak is very inviting . I'll have it .
__label__anger	You are passing the buck . I'll be hanged if I ask you to go to the park with us .
__label__joy	You have to . It is sure .
__label__joy	Wow , you ’ re up early today ! What ’ s for breakfast ?
__label__disgust	I think it is the worst one I have ever seen .
__label__joy	Thank you . I'm glad that you believe me .
__label__joy	The Palace Hotel .
__label__joy	Thanks for your praise , Madam .
__label__joy	Thank you , ma'am . It's been a pleasure doing business with you .
__label__joy	Jenny , I want to go on a picnic . Could you come too ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__surprise	I just cann't believe my ears !
__label__anger	Why don ’ t you marry Rose , then ?
__label__surprise	Really ? What's the series about ?
__label__anger	I'm glad you like it .
__label__joy	An interesting meeting , isn't it ?
__label__joy	If you are free , maybe you can get having for my birthday party , it should be fun .
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__joy	I believe you were the best choice for that promotion . I really do .
__label__fear	It's scary .
__label__joy	thank you . I couldn't wait any longer to have a taste .
__label__sadness	In that case , I don't think I'll buy one here .
__label__joy	Oh , thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Okay , sir , here you are . Thank you very much .
__label__anger	Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded .
__label__joy	Oh , it's interesting . Dad told me you brought him here when he was young , too . Now , it's my turn .
__label__joy	OK . I promise . Thank you , Mom .
__label__joy	Well , maybe you are right . We'll be more amused in a tram or a double-decker than on the subway .
__label__joy	Come on . Getting a tan symbolizes health and wealth in western countries .
__label__joy	Got it . Thank you , Shirley .
__label__joy	That sounds just wonderful to us .
__label__joy	I ’ m sure I will .
__label__surprise	Really ? What else have you discovered ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much . This is for your help .
__label__joy	Oh , it's nothing to speak of .
__label__joy	It's a perfect fit .
__label__joy	Great idea ! I do it every so often .
__label__sadness	That ’ s a little troublesome .
__label__joy	She is a real star . Not a onetime thing .
__label__joy	Yeah , I agree.It makes you feel really good .
__label__joy	Would you prefer our cocktail — Shanghai cocktail ? It's a mixture of real Chinese ingredients .
__label__joy	Ok , thanks ...
__label__anger	It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
__label__sadness	I just lost my job . I'm just worried about how I'm going to pay the bills .
__label__surprise	Good gracious . That ’ s incredible !
__label__joy	I'm glad to hear that.Bye .
__label__joy	Right . The city life has made us tired and out of energy , while the natural world can bring us quite new feelings .
__label__joy	My birthday comes next month . I want to hold a birthday party , too .
__label__disgust	Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows .
__label__joy	Yeah , good idea.We can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill . I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot .
__label__anger	Me ? No way , keep him away from me , please .
__label__joy	Excellent , come over at ten o'clock and we will start at the shopping center , the one around the corner from my house . They have just the shop we need .
__label__joy	Hello , Lucy , I heard you did a good deal in interview .
__label__joy	That sounds like a good deal .
__label__joy	Very good idea . Sometimes such pictures can show the house's richness .
__label__joy	I love your bracelet . When did you get it ?
__label__joy	How about going to hear a country-and-western singer tonight ?
__label__surprise	My goodness ! My silk dress is shrunk . How did you wash it ?
__label__joy	It's got a built-in video camera so you can see the person you're talking to . It also takes stills and I can use the E-mail mode to send digital pictures straight to my friend's phone !
__label__joy	That ’ s a great idea . Which charities would you support ?
__label__joy	I think this is the coolest watch I've ever owned .
__label__sadness	I see your point , but I seem to be on bad terms with them .
__label__joy	And it ’ s a bargaining . A house like this in river side costs double the price .
__label__joy	That's good , thank you .
__label__joy	I'll see you tomorrow then .
__label__joy	That sounds good . I think I'll have the same .
__label__joy	They're so much fun to eat . You can suck all the coating off first ...
__label__anger	How annoying !
__label__surprise	Really ? Thank you .
__label__sadness	I'm afraid I've got a terrible cold . What should I do ?
__label__joy	Thank you , David . You're always so encouraging .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__anger	That wouldn ’ t be a lie !
__label__joy	Yes , it looks perfect .
__label__joy	My poor memory . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	And hundreds of booths-all filled with different kinds of stuff .
__label__joy	Of course . Take your time and enjoy your trip .
__label__surprise	Really ? What time and where ?
__label__joy	That is a relief . It's a good thing we moved .
__label__joy	What a lovely day , isn't it ?
__label__surprise	Oh ? That's a surprise . Let me see ... D 0411 Our dog's birthday . Yes , I'm sure this my parking space !
__label__joy	Would you like to stretch your legs ?
__label__joy	Oh , they're both so beautiful . Let me have this one , I think .
__label__joy	Exactly .
__label__sadness	I have just got lost with my friends . Would you please help me find them ?
__label__joy	So romantic.young people must have lot of fun .
__label__joy	Ahh ... What a fine day ! I do feel like an outdoor exercise .
__label__joy	Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ?
__label__joy	Which hotel will the reception be held at ?
__label__joy	I like the sight and the sound . It worked on me like a magic when I was a child
__label__anger	I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again !
__label__joy	thank you very much !
__label__anger	Jennifer Davies ? Give me a break ! I can't stand her . She's such a dweeb ! How could she possibly ace it when she keeps cutting class all the time ?
__label__joy	Obviously you did enjoy the concert .
__label__joy	Yes , it was quite a long flight . I'm glad to finally be here .
__label__joy	Mr . Wilson . I'm very glad we reached the agreement at last . Now I'd like to propose a toast to the further development of our cooperation .
__label__joy	It's great !
__label__joy	That's interesting . How often do you write a blog ?
__label__joy	Oh , I ’ m crazy about them .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__joy	Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ’ t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret !
__label__joy	Same here .
__label__joy	But I must say , if it were only for the weather , I like autumn most !
__label__joy	Bye .
__label__joy	I'd love to .
__label__joy	Sounds good , regular car wash package will be OK .
__label__joy	You know , art is something I've always been interested in ...
__label__joy	Thanks , Mark . I used to be a member of the school choir .
__label__joy	Good . I'll give you a call tonight .
__label__joy	The pleasure is mine .
__label__anger	No way , Kate . I mean it's just not my fault .
__label__joy	No problem ! Now for your pants , let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
__label__joy	Great . You can move in next Monday . Your first month's rent is due then .
__label__joy	Certainly , sir . Double or single breasted ?
__label__joy	I really like this one .
__label__joy	Pretty good . I ’ Ve just had my new poems published .
__label__joy	My boss offered me a promotion , and I took it .
__label__joy	Hi , David . What a beautiful necklace ! Dude , I ’ Ve never seen anything like it .
__label__joy	Thanks , Mom . Thanks .
__label__surprise	$ 900 a month ? We don ’ t often have apartment as inexpensive as that . We have one apartment for $ 985 a month today , on Eleventh Avenue . It ’ s near the municipal buildings .
__label__joy	Well ... thanks , Marcia.It ' s very nice of you to say so . I mean ...
__label__joy	Sure , I'll let you know if I need anything . Hm , this mattress is very firm . Jack will probably like it .
__label__joy	Everyone in Taiwan knows it . Come on ! Sing with us !
__label__surprise	God save me ! Is there anything wrong with you ? Didn't I tell you ?
__label__joy	I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day .
__label__joy	No trouble . I enjoyed helping you .
__label__anger	Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen .
__label__joy	Yes , I like to make new friends .
__label__surprise	America ? Did you get admit to MIT ?
__label__joy	Very good ! Chinese food rules ! I expect the next time .
__label__joy	I have tickets to The Phantom of the Opera on Friday night . Would you like to go ?
__label__sadness	I'm worrying that she may be lost .
__label__disgust	Nasty . You'd better not rub your eyes .
__label__joy	Alright . That's a good idea .
__label__joy	I'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got a partner .
__label__sadness	It's your turn , sir.Sorry to keep you waiting .
__label__joy	I just wanted to tell you what a great time I had with you at the movies last week .
__label__joy	How do you do , Mr . Brown ? It ’ s a pleasure to get to know you .
__label__joy	That's great ! We made 20 minutes earlier .
__label__sadness	Sorry , but I'm on my way out now . Could you come back in an hour ?
__label__surprise	What ? Why do we have to do that ?
__label__surprise	Because the board said 60 pesos for every Taiwan dollar .
__label__joy	This really has been a wonderful holiday for us . Shall we take a walk around the pond or into those woods for a while ?
__label__joy	Ha ! I'm just warming up ! Please take me there now !
__label__surprise	What ? Really ? I don ’ t really want to have to buy a new phone .
__label__anger	Oh , that's the worst .
__label__joy	To thank you for helping me at work last week . If you would not have been so kind , I would not have been able to pick my parents from the airport . You really did me a big favor . Thank you so much .
__label__sadness	I'll tell you all about it another day .
__label__joy	That would be great ! I hate working with computers !
__label__joy	It's a nice cinema , isn't it ?
__label__joy	Great . We can't keep up with the demand .
__label__fear	Oh , that scared me .
__label__joy	I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . But why not take it easy ?
__label__joy	When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? Next Saturday ?
__label__sadness	I have been looking forward to this performance all month .
__label__surprise	Ah ? Really ? That stinks !
__label__joy	We're waiting in line to get one of Master Li's Chinese couplets . I got one last year and I had good luck all year !
__label__joy	Good idea ! I finish work at five . Why don ’ t we meet at six ?
__label__joy	Well , uh ... why not dine out together and go to the movies ?
__label__joy	Nice to meet you , too .
__label__joy	excellent choice . I love its smooth flavor .
__label__joy	I ’ m fine . Thank you .
__label__joy	Could you tell me something about the Mid-Autumn Festival ? I find it also very interesting .
__label__anger	Why did you lie to me in the email ?
__label__joy	Thanks a lot for your help .
__label__surprise	What ? What does that mean ? Why won't there be any results ?
__label__disgust	I hate it .
__label__joy	It's interesting and I want to buy one home .
__label__disgust	I think that would be horrible !
__label__surprise	Oh , yes ! I completely forgot about it .
__label__joy	Cheer !
__label__joy	No , that's it , thank you .
__label__surprise	He is so kind . I couldn ’ t believe he murdered his wife .
__label__joy	No other city can match it . It's heaven .
__label__surprise	What news ?
__label__anger	Fine . I ’ ll take the compact .
__label__surprise	Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars !
__label__joy	And the host announced that he won it all !
__label__surprise	My goodness ! What happened ? You have blood on your face .
__label__joy	What an attractive blouse , You look so pretty in this blue dress !
__label__joy	How about having dinner with me ?
__label__sadness	Oh , sorry ! I forgot you get queasy with the sight of blood . I'll be right there .
__label__joy	I ’ m glad to hear that you finally found an apartment .
__label__joy	Yes , the chicken looks wonderful !
__label__joy	Thank you ! My wife likes cooking very much .
__label__joy	It's a good thing you can speak English !
__label__surprise	Really ? I thought his wife couldn ’ t have a baby .
__label__joy	That ’ s a great idea . I ’ ll try it on .
__label__joy	no wonder you like the class so much .
__label__anger	How could I feel easy ? I ’ m really pissed .
__label__joy	Sure . If you get on this road and turn left at the second intersection , you'll see it on your right-hand side .
__label__joy	That is what I want to say .
__label__sadness	Well , he's become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band . And one night last weekend , he came home really late , way past his curfew .
__label__joy	I surely will . By the way , is the party like this held every weekend in our neighborhood ?
__label__surprise	What ?
__label__joy	Sure . I don't want to waste even a minute .
__label__fear	I don't know what to do , if I can't find the money .
__label__surprise	You are kidding me ? It is against the labor law . They should be aware of their rights .
__label__joy	Yes . If you put a few drops on someone's eyelids while he's asleep , he'll fall in love with the first person he sees when he wakes up .
__label__joy	Your achievement is obvious to all .
__label__joy	She is really something .
__label__joy	My pleasure .
__label__surprise	A receipt ?
__label__joy	Don ’ t mention it .
__label__anger	Are you crazy ? You made the mistake and now you're charging me for your mistake ?
__label__surprise	You are kidding .
__label__joy	What is the weather like in Washington at this time of this year ?
__label__sadness	Sorry . You have to buy your ticket at the next counter .
__label__joy	It's really healthy to do some exercise there . The air is fresher and it's romantic to watch the sunset with your lover .
__label__anger	And let them ruin my life ? Forget it !
__label__joy	Yeah , she is great . I also admire her for her concern about society .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry . I think we're out of this skirt in this color . Do you want me to call another one of our store to see if it's available there ?
__label__joy	Hmm . This system seems to have everything I'm looking for . It's a bit pricey , though . I'll have to think about it . Thanks for your help .
__label__joy	Sure , I would love to go with you . When would you be leaving ?
__label__joy	Very much . New York is such a nice place . Shall I show you some photographs ?
__label__joy	I'd love something spicy . Maybe we could get some Sichuan hotpot .
__label__surprise	Oh , my bread !
__label__joy	You are very modest . Best luck in your new position .
__label__joy	I will .
__label__joy	We plan to go to a forest in the suburb . There is a beautiful river there . We can do some fishing .
__label__surprise	Again ? The area around the park is too dark at night . There should be more lights there .
__label__joy	You see ? Every cloud has a silver lining .
__label__joy	Ok . See you later .
__label__joy	Guess what , Gilly ? I won both bids .
__label__surprise	Ridiculous ! They haven't met ! Maybe they're the same sex !
__label__joy	I would buy that kind of book !
__label__joy	Yeah . He ’ s older , so he doesn ’ t slam as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ’ s still amazing .
__label__joy	OK . I will mention how great you were about helping me today . I appreciate your help .
__label__joy	It's nice and bright today , isn't it ?
__label__sadness	Yes , I know , sir . I'm sorry .
__label__joy	No , just bring yourself . I hope to see you there .
__label__joy	Nice pun . What is it you active about him most ?
__label__joy	Oh , how nice ! There are bright rooms and the house is very quiet .
__label__disgust	Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball !
__label__joy	Come on in . Make yourself at home .
__label__anger	This is the end , Jane . I don't want a girlfriend who goes out with other guys all the time .
__label__disgust	I swear , I ’ m going to kill you for this .
__label__surprise	Is that true ? I can't believe it . There are always some meetings in this company .
__label__joy	It's very exciting . I think .
__label__joy	Wish you good luck !
__label__joy	Hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__surprise	France ? Is he crazy ?
__label__sadness	I'm sorry I couldn't help you .
__label__joy	Do you know that the dolphin is the most intelligent animal in the world ?
__label__joy	oh , that sounds wonderful . I have always known you two would make it . I hope I can keep in better contact with you guys . I don't want us to drift apart again .
__label__joy	You have such good ideas !
__label__joy	That looks great . Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
__label__surprise	I ’ m getting this beret ? Doesn ’ t it look cool ? I ’ d like to get some jeans too , but I don ’ t have enough cash on me .
__label__joy	"ok , it just says , ball , blah , blah ... "" Ray and I look forward to seeing you in June . Write soon . With love , Sue . """
__label__joy	This is my house.Let me show you around it .
__label__joy	And it's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting , and music . Just amazing !
__label__sadness	I will get right on that , and I am very sorry .
__label__sadness	Oh , my god ! My wallet is lost . What should I do ? It drives me bonkers .
__label__joy	You may be right , but it doesn't hurt to find out more about what's going on in his life .
__label__joy	I will . Thank you , Dad .
__label__joy	Good . I'll do it .
__label__anger	Go on your vacation with Mark and when you come back , why don't you just move in with him as well !
__label__joy	Another weekend is coming !
__label__joy	Thank you for your compliments . I will try even harder to repay the company and your support .
__label__joy	what about taking her for a dinner or a movie ?
__label__joy	That would be a good idea .
__label__joy	I think the Saudi Arabian will hit the spot today .
__label__joy	Thank you . You ’ Ve been so nice to me .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	It is extremely beautiful.This is the very thing I've been dreaming of.Please put in a gift box for me .
__label__surprise	Really ? I hope we will do much better under her guidance .
__label__joy	No , thank you .
__label__sadness	well , I think I was being a little selfish myself . I know they don't get to see each other very often .
__label__sadness	I'm afraid you can't . You'll have to go out there and walk around .
__label__surprise	What ?
__label__joy	Well , it's not how much , but what I'm going to buy that matters . I'm going ski shopping !
__label__joy	It is so very kind of you . I'm so moved by you .
__label__disgust	The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart .
__label__joy	I'd like some toast and chicken wings .
__label__sadness	Sorry , sir . We have only tables in the main dinning room left .
__label__joy	Thank you so much !
__label__surprise	Really ? What's that ?
__label__joy	I ’ m glad to hear that .
__label__joy	Thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me ! I ’ Ve always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me ! Let ’ s get started !
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__surprise	Predictable ! How ! Come on Dick , It ’ s a G-rated movie ! It ’ s for the kids ! It ’ s not a thriller !
__label__joy	Darling , this dress is for you . I hope you like it .
__label__joy	Certainly .
__label__joy	Yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either .
__label__joy	Why don't you have dinner with me tonight ?
__label__joy	That sounds great . What time should I come over ?
__label__joy	Great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days !
__label__joy	Yeah , there isn ’ t a bad seat in the place .
__label__joy	Very good . It's done just right this time , thank you .
__label__joy	It's kind of you to meet me at the airport .
__label__sadness	I am sorry , sir , the fish you ordered will take a longer time because we make it with fresh fish .
__label__surprise	Hello , Ann ! Is that you ?
__label__joy	I promise I will take the first chance to call on you . Please send your wife with my best regards .
__label__joy	Thank you.But it is too bright for me .
__label__surprise	What ? What happened ?
__label__joy	That's the spirit . Never give up on your dream .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Sounds good . I don ’ t want it to be too expensive , maybe something mid-range .
__label__anger	You can't be serious !
__label__joy	The game starts at seven so we'd better hustle , it's already five .
__label__joy	One more from Carla .
__label__joy	Everything's great . And you ?
__label__joy	Well , I like collecting matchbox ! I'm not sure if that counts , though .
__label__joy	The landscaping is wonderful !
__label__joy	Good idea . Oh , by the way , would you please pick me up after the party , honey ?
__label__joy	Thank you , David .
__label__joy	Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
__label__sadness	I feel so tired .
__label__joy	Of course . We both experienced a good cooperation .
__label__joy	Even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ?
__label__joy	I've got it . I like the feeling of stepping on the ice .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	Is that your new bicycle ?
__label__joy	Thank you . I am glad that everything turned out so well .
__label__joy	Yes , the meal was very delicious and I enjoyed very much . I'm full .
__label__joy	Yes , it helps me to relax .
__label__joy	Sure .
__label__joy	I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers .
__label__joy	It sounds interesting .
__label__joy	Yes , you are right . And I was so tired out that I fell asleep on the way back . My muscles are still stiff from the swim yesterday .
__label__joy	OK , let's meet at the movie theater entrance tonight . Don ’ t be late .
__label__joy	Ok . Don't forget to bring your umbrella . The rain can start up again anytime .
__label__sadness	I drink a lot of wine .
__label__sadness	I'm busy year in and year out , but now I've done nothing .
__label__joy	Not at all .
__label__surprise	Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ’ s a lot of weight !
__label__fear	Phew ! . . . Wait a minute , CRASH ? ? ! ! Spyware ? Trojans ! What ? where ? when ? !
__label__joy	A chess board ! Daddy is going to teach you how to play !
__label__joy	Okay , see you then .
__label__sadness	Well , yes , I am . I'm worried about my work . I've just taken a new job . I earn a lot of money but it's difficult work . I'm always afraid of making a mistake .
__label__joy	I see . Thanks anyway .
__label__surprise	how do you know her ?
__label__joy	Here we are , Ryan ! This is where we're going to celebrate !
__label__joy	Look ! This stock is rising now . I am researching it , and planning to buy some shares .
__label__joy	Sorry , I think I'Il sit out the next dance .
__label__anger	I think it's because of your bad habits !
__label__joy	He is such a handsome guy . He gets his looks from his mother of course !
__label__joy	Why not ? We should do it . Because now we can afford it .
__label__joy	Yeah .
__label__surprise	You got lost . You're kidding !
__label__surprise	What ? Are you kidding ? I'm only 22 years old !
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	Why not ? I've been craving good food for three weeks now . I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza !
__label__joy	This morning ! No more overtime , and no more headaches !
__label__joy	Yeah . Each style is specially designed by world's top designers . So they can always make you look amazing .
__label__joy	How about we hook up for lunch at 12:00 , and then go see the movie afterwards .
__label__joy	Cheer !
__label__joy	Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it .
__label__surprise	Oh , great ! That's at the other end of the terminal !
__label__joy	It ’ s China ’ s service now . What a superb jump serve by Li , oh , and we have a let serve . The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net .
__label__joy	Very good . Could I serve you anything else ?
__label__sadness	Miss , I'm very sorry for the delay , please enjoy this . Free a glass of wine for inconvenience . Again I'm terribly sorry to make you wait so long .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	That would be a great choice !
__label__joy	Thank you . Wow , your school has so many honors . Congratulations !
__label__joy	That's easy , how about a cowgirl ? Oh I know even better , a Canadian Mountie .
__label__joy	I'm playing with my new jump rope ! Watch this !
__label__surprise	That ’ s great . What are the prizes ?
__label__joy	Thanks , dear .
__label__joy	What kind of music do you like best ?
__label__joy	Yes , it ’ s exciting . This month we are doing crossword puzzles .
__label__joy	Then I bet he's really good !
__label__anger	It's my pleasure to talk with you .
__label__anger	You're going to make me rich by not paying me ?
__label__joy	Friday sounds good .
__label__joy	Don't be silly . It's no trouble at all .
__label__joy	Thank you for your kindness . I will think about it carefully .
__label__joy	That would be great ! Give me a call !
__label__disgust	Oh , Goodness , please not again.That ' s what we did last week .
__label__joy	Sure , let ’ s take a look . Sweetie , this is terrific . Your ideas are so original .
__label__joy	Oh , it's really a drag .
__label__joy	That's very good . It's said that marriage is the Ab of love . But the words may not be right .
__label__sadness	My bad . I didn't realize that it was so late .
__label__joy	We should come here more often .
__label__joy	You seem to have it down . Have a good day !
__label__joy	That's good . You can put one in this room and put the other one in that room .
__label__joy	Bye bye .
__label__joy	Great ! I'm your lucky fellow then .
__label__joy	Alright . Thank you . Yes , it seems to be working fine . Your total is $ 199.00 , sign here , please .
__label__joy	Well , I really recommend Spain . You really should go . Anyway , it's been great to catch up , but I must be going , this is my floor . Speak again soon I hope .
__label__joy	Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ?
__label__joy	Great ! I ’ ll take it .
__label__joy	Of course !
__label__sadness	I knew this would happen some day ...
__label__joy	No problem . My husband bought me some beautiful jewellery for our anniversary and I don't feel safe keeping it in the house . Initially , on the advice of a friend , I stored it in the freezer .
__label__joy	Ha ha , come on ! Well , I ’ Ve been watching what I eat , and working out three times a week . By the way , I heard your son recently graduated !
__label__joy	What kind of music is it ?
__label__joy	Thank you for your hospitality .
__label__joy	Oh ! I see . I'll have the paperback , please .
__label__joy	Sure that sounds great ! Are there any other fees ?
__label__joy	She is a great addition to my class .
__label__joy	great ! Thank you !
__label__anger	No , no ! Stupid machine , what are you doing ! No !
__label__surprise	That's incredible . I cann't believe it .
__label__joy	I'm so glad you can finally see things in my way . Can we leave this dull place now ?
__label__joy	Yes ! We made it . 5 fifty-eight , just before the library closes .
__label__joy	I am too .
__label__joy	Wow . I really like California ... the weather there is much better than the East Coast .
__label__joy	Hi , Monica , congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company .
__label__joy	I know . Goodnight .
__label__joy	So , the quicker I pay it back , the more I can save in interest ? That's excellent . Thanks so much for your information . I'll come in shortly to take the relevant steps for the loan .
__label__joy	That's fine , thanks .
__label__anger	My car won ’ t start ! Stupid old car !
__label__anger	I don't think you really want to hear about it .
__label__joy	Yes , I ‘ d love to . it ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
__label__joy	That would be great . I would love some .
__label__joy	Good morning , Emma ! A lovely day , isn't it ?
__label__joy	It's very kind of you .
__label__joy	Ahahah ... you miss her point for sure . H & K actually is an acronym for ' hug and kiss ' .
__label__disgust	Hey , watch where you ’ re going !
__label__fear	But there are only two more days until the bidding closes !
__label__surprise	You did it yourself ? Wow , you are good !
__label__anger	Don't brother me !
__label__joy	That sounds great !
__label__joy	Well , good-bye and have a good trip !
__label__joy	Yes . I ’ m Tony . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Really ? That's great ! I'm going to try that next time .
__label__joy	I hope I still have chances .
__label__sadness	Well , you're right . I just broke up with Jane .
__label__disgust	Isn't it awful ? I can't bear to look at it . I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks .
__label__joy	Better luck this time .
__label__joy	Well , we'll be careful . Thanks for letting me know .
__label__joy	I went to visit a customer in IVS Company the other day . Their offices were very impressive , especially their company Logo which is all over the place . There are Logo models in metal , copper , clove , paper . They are even printed on the wall paper and the balls of the table-lights . It is really decorated identity .
__label__surprise	I don ’ t know why there ’ s a problem .
__label__anger	You know , now that I think about it , I really don't have much more to say to you at all !
__label__joy	Umm . I think I ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
__label__joy	I see . Well , you have come to the right place . We have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers .
__label__surprise	Why you are so crazy about Beijing Opera ? It's so boring .
__label__joy	I'm not flattering you.You ' re full of energy every day .
__label__joy	The bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ?
__label__surprise	Wow , Arthur ! You ’ re as blind as a bat !
__label__joy	It's fun .
__label__surprise	That sounds quite big ! How many people live there ?
__label__joy	He seems to win awards everywhere .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	Oh , this silk carpet is really beautiful . Look at the pattern , and how delicate it is !
__label__joy	Let's go there for lunch ! I'm up for an adventure !
__label__sadness	Although I am a little shocked , I can deal with it pretty well . I didn't perform as well as I should have in the interview .
__label__joy	I'm fine . After ten years , you still look great !
__label__surprise	really ? What is it ?
__label__joy	Sure . That would be great . Good luck .
__label__joy	All right . I'll call you tonight and tell you the time .
__label__joy	Yes , it is . The sun is shining . There is no wind , only a pleasant breeze .
__label__joy	Peach blossom is really beautiful .
__label__joy	Yes , and it goes beautifully with your pants .
__label__sadness	I'm afraid not . The church is booked until the year 2001 .
__label__joy	I am so happy to know that I could make some contribution to our company .
__label__joy	Of course , I will .
__label__sadness	I am sorry , sir . I have broken the reading lamp in my room .
__label__joy	Caesar salads are pretty good .
__label__joy	I ’ m looking forward to reading that . We could have book signings by famous professors an alumni .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Excellent . How many would you like ?
__label__joy	Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ?
__label__joy	This apartment looks nice .
__label__joy	You must be pretty excited about your trip to Europe . When is it that you are leaving ?
__label__joy	Mary , this is Mr . Wu , my new Chinese friend .
__label__anger	I agree , it's just never on time .
__label__joy	They must be popular again this season .
__label__joy	No problem . That ’ s one dollar extra .
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? Nice to meet you . I thought they were going to leave me here on my own ! How long have you been with the company ?
__label__sadness	Oh , I've been fine , but I'm having some trouble with my son .
__label__joy	All right , see you later .
__label__joy	Did you have fun there ?
__label__joy	Wasn't that a great flick ? I was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie .
__label__surprise	Really ? I thought that they'd been killing us by now .
__label__joy	Wow . this is nice . I'll take this one . I guess if she doesn't like it she can return it , right ?
__label__surprise	You did give me a surprise . How have you been ?
__label__joy	So what ? It only makes her look cheap and vulgar .
__label__joy	You are a woman after my own heart . I don't know many people who can handle spicy food . Are you sure you are up for hot pot ?
__label__joy	That would be great ! Thanks a lot !
__label__joy	you're right ! How are you ? It's been a long time !
__label__surprise	Really ? Good for you .
__label__surprise	Why are you so early today ?
__label__joy	That ’ s all right . Thank you all the same .
__label__joy	That will be great .
__label__surprise	are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ?
__label__joy	I hope so . Thank you again for your delightful gift .
__label__surprise	Wow ! What's the hold up ?
__label__joy	Do we need an appointment beforehand ?
__label__joy	So romantic . Young people must have lot of fun .
__label__joy	Hey , you have been promoted to president of the department .
__label__joy	Good idea , especially at this price .
__label__joy	Yes , the applause ! That was what kept waking me up during the show .
__label__joy	I think you know that you have to make the best decision for you . Enjoy your year !
__label__joy	This apartment is nice , but I'd like to find a cheaper one .
__label__anger	You don't know what you are asking !
__label__joy	Glad to meet you , too .
__label__joy	The climate here is pleasant .
__label__joy	Sounds good . Okay , that ’ s it .
__label__joy	I am glad to hear that .
__label__joy	Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ?
__label__joy	What kinds of sports do you like ?
__label__joy	Congratulations on your success in the competition . That is quite something .
__label__joy	Tomorrow , I ’ ll cut the grass . Then the garden will look perfect .
__label__joy	How time flies ! I'll not see twenty again .
__label__joy	Hi ! Let me get a dozen croissants , four blueberry muffins and a loaf of sourdough bread .
__label__joy	You're right . I love it very much .
__label__joy	I'll let you break the balls this time .
__label__joy	Really ? That's wonderful !
__label__joy	And lightweight , too . It'll play for 20 hours on two AA batteries !

__label__joy	Thank you very much . I have been looking for it for a long time . Is this the latest edition ?
__label__joy	All of the extra information that you need is on the bulletin board in the hallway . See you on Monday !
__label__disgust	The heat is driving crazy and I hate my new hat .
__label__joy	Happy birthday , Lillian . Here's a little present I bought for you .

__label__joy	I really enjoyed the food .
__label__anger	you can say that again ! He won't even let us check our personal email at work !
__label__joy	You are in good shape . Figuring in your other expenses , you can easily afford a house costing seven hundred thousand or maybe even a little more !
__label__joy	Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in real love ?
__label__disgust	I'm sorry , I'm very tired . I'm going to bed early . I didn't have good time , and I don't really want to see you again .
__label__joy	Thank you , they are beautiful .
__label__joy	Really ! So it is just near my office building . Great ! How much is the rent ?
__label__joy	Looks like we both float back and forth . I'm baritone .
__label__joy	What do you suggest then ?
__label__joy	Both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . And I usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
__label__joy	I heard you were on a date last night ! So , how did it go ? I want all the juicy details !
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__joy	It's Friday .
__label__joy	That's all right . I hope we can help you at some other time . Good-bye .

__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__sadness	I'm really sorry , I'll bring you a hot one right away .
__label__joy	Well , I ’ m glad that everything else is to your liking .
__label__joy	I've mailed a formal written invitation to your home inviting you to a dinner party at my home .
__label__anger	I really want to take him over my knee .
__label__joy	To tell you the truth , I have never thought of being a swimmer . I swim just for fun .
__label__joy	I like the fact that I get to work with people . It makes the day go by much faster .
__label__joy	I am having a party Saturday night at my house . If you have time , you should come .
__label__joy	I appreciate the offer . I will come on time next Monday . See you then !
__label__joy	Wow , this is nice ! Ok , sign me up for both publications .
__label__joy	I absolutely love what you're wearing today .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Today ?

__label__joy	I will . Thank you , dad .
__label__joy	Thanks !
__label__joy	Of course I am . Well , pleasant dreams !
__label__anger	Just an animal ? But it has life too . If you want a tattoo , get one . It's your choice because you want it . But has anyone asked the fish if it wanted one ?
__label__joy	Thank you ! The same to you .
__label__joy	Ok . I can't wait to see it . Let's go !
__label__joy	You are very nice and helpful . Hope to see you again .
__label__joy	Yeah , I know . Shop till you drop .
__label__joy	Oh yeah ? I could use some . What ’ s up ?
__label__joy	You are right about that .
__label__joy	You did a good job . I'm extremely proud of you .
__label__joy	OK . I'll take it .
__label__joy	Have a nice weekend !
__label__anger	it sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now !
__label__joy	I appreciate that .
__label__disgust	So what ?
__label__joy	How about dinner tonight ? My treat .
__label__joy	Very well . Just take your time .
__label__sadness	Oh , no ! What happened ?
__label__joy	Please say goodbye to the rest of the family for me .
__label__joy	Oh , I got it . It simulates the real supermarket , which makes it feel so real . Mom will love it . She loves shopping in supermarkets .
__label__joy	Just water would be fine .
__label__joy	Okay , thank you .
__label__joy	It's good to be home .
__label__joy	What is that ? It looks like something from a swamp !
__label__joy	Thanks for inviting me . And happy birthday , Julia .
__label__joy	I had my own ways of finding out . It's a secret . You look so beautiful today . Your new shirt goes well with your skirt .
__label__joy	Sure , take your time . We have a whole day .
__label__joy	Without a doubt . Relevant department will try their best .
__label__joy	Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city .
__label__joy	Ha-ha ! You got me there !
__label__surprise	Aren't firecrackers forbidden in the city ?
__label__joy	That's fine . Let me get your meat .
__label__surprise	Really ? He is so great .
__label__joy	No wonder people say
__label__disgust	Everything seems to be getting worse . I don't know what to do with it .
__label__surprise	Really ? Tell me without delay .
__label__joy	I am . Don ’ t worry about getting your wallet . It ’ s my treat .
__label__anger	Uh ! Dad !
__label__joy	Good morning , Miss Monica . Nice to meet you again !
__label__joy	Sure . Thank you for saying that . Actually , those songs were sung for the first time today . I wrote them in the past two months .
__label__joy	That happened quickly ! Are you going to see him again ?
__label__sadness	Sorry , sir . We have never done that before .
__label__joy	He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .
__label__joy	I have a good feeling about this house .
__label__joy	I want you to have a walk with me .
__label__disgust	But I still get stuck on the different tones . It drives me crazy .
__label__joy	Does 6,30 suit you ?
__label__joy	Yeah , It was scary , but exhilarating .
__label__anger	You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?
__label__joy	I'm very grateful for what you have done to my son , doctor .
__label__joy	Thank you . It's very nice when problems can be solved quickly .
__label__joy	Shall we visit our math teacher tomorrow ?
__label__joy	Happy Mother's Day , Mom !
__label__anger	Yikes ! you are joking , right ? I can't believe it . No wonder he is so stressed and bossy lately . I thought he was just being ostentatious by giving orders to people and all the different departments . What big shoes to fill !
__label__joy	The days are getting longer !
__label__joy	Thanks . I really appreciate it . Thanks so much .
__label__joy	That ’ s correct . we have four seasons of spring
__label__joy	Terrific ! When are you moving in ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__surprise	Really ? In my eyes it ’ s normal , as an old man , to be thin is better than to be fat .
__label__joy	come on , you sound like my Mom.Look at that , it's beautiful !
__label__joy	Ok . Take care . Have a nice journey .
__label__joy	We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them .
__label__joy	Tell me about it .
__label__joy	Yeah . I really like the stores and the shopping .
__label__joy	Thanks . I think I'll go check that out now .
__label__joy	Actually , our new math teacher is a good person . He just can't find an appropriate way to teach us .
__label__sadness	Oh , lilies of the valley . No , I am sorry . We are all out of them right now .
__label__joy	Thanks . Have a good one .
__label__joy	Hi , Lilly , it ’ s so nice to see you again .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Mary's father is a rich man , isn't he ?
__label__joy	Ok - when you leave the Underground , cross the road and you should see Horntown Street . Was up that street to the crossroads . As you was you should see a fast food place on your right .
__label__joy	Thanks for offering to give me a lift . I ’ m looking forward to this party , but I didn ’ t want to go alone .
__label__joy	We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okapi ! There ’ s the pitch , he hits it ! It ’ s going , going , that ball is gone !
__label__joy	Of course , I will .
__label__joy	How do you do , Mr . Wu ? Welcome .
__label__joy	That sounds good . Do I need to bring anything ?
__label__anger	Yeah , yeah , I know what I selected . Just gimme my money !
__label__joy	That's a good idea !
__label__joy	How did you know ! They say listening to classical music can make your baby smarter !
__label__joy	Sure . What is it ?
__label__joy	She is quite young and her hair is blond .
__label__sadness	Sorry to hear that .
__label__joy	Me , too . I've heard so much about you .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Cool ! Flashy red lines !
__label__joy	Oh , don't . I'm sure you'll be the loveliest bride ever !
__label__joy	The salmon is good toady , it's very fresh .
__label__joy	Yeah . He was a real slave driver . He probably would have loved it if we were robots .
__label__joy	I like them very much . We also eat a lot of vegetables in my country , buy we eat different kinds .
__label__joy	Nice to see you , Patrick .
__label__anger	I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time !
__label__joy	Oh , yes . Marvelous !
__label__joy	It's not expensive . OK . I'll take them .
__label__surprise	I can't believe it 。
__label__joy	Great ! It's always better to do things with a friend .
__label__joy	Maybe now I ’ ll get that promotion I was hoping for .
__label__surprise	What ? Why ? Can ’ t you renew it ?
__label__joy	That sounds good .
__label__joy	Boy , oh boy ! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks .
__label__joy	Brazil calls for a time out and we ’ ll be right back , after a short commercial break .
__label__joy	Great ! Do you know how to get there ?
__label__joy	Thanks . But it's necessary for me to buy a TV set .
__label__joy	Oh , man . I had the best supper last night . My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing !
__label__joy	That ’ s amazing . The rent is very cheap .
__label__joy	Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__surprise	How embarrassing ! I don ’ t even recognize a description of my own mother ! How important do you think appearance is ?
__label__joy	Yes , and could you write down anything you might be having trouble with ?
__label__joy	Congratulations ! I knew you could do it .
__label__joy	Yes , Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn .
__label__joy	Great . I'll take one .
__label__joy	It's my heart ; it's made of what you like .
__label__surprise	Really ? Me , too . What's your favorite flavor ?
__label__joy	That's great . Let's go !
__label__anger	Fine ! What do you need ?
__label__joy	Thanks ! Now I don ’ t need to come back to the shop a second time .
__label__joy	Thanks for inviting me over for dinner this evening .
__label__joy	Of course !
__label__anger	I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots .
__label__joy	Here you are .
__label__joy	Of course .
__label__joy	Ok , it's a date then !
__label__joy	I just heard your boy had taken the first place in the history test . He is super cool .
__label__joy	Yes , that sounds right for me .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , I haven't decided yet.Do you mind giving me a couple of minutes ?
__label__joy	All right . I will take one .
__label__joy	Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me .
__label__joy	Me too .
__label__joy	It is . However , you will suffer from muscle pain for many days you are a first-time rider .
__label__joy	Very good ! I'm looking forward to it . Please give my best regards to John . And I wish you best luck !
__label__joy	Fabulous ! We should look at engagement rings then ! Now that ’ s a whole other section .
__label__joy	That ’ s a pretty name . Give your wife my best !
__label__joy	It's a fine day today , isn't it ?
__label__joy	Congratulations on your success .
__label__joy	Goodbye and all the best .
__label__joy	Thank you very much . I think I lost it near the window .
__label__joy	Thanks for letting me know . I feel relieved now .
__label__surprise	150 ? No , I'm not really interested in this place . It isn't big enough . It isn't near enough to my office .
__label__joy	Well , that's a relief .
__label__joy	Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it .
__label__joy	Not at all .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , but that's our only available time .
__label__joy	Happy Anniversary , honey .
__label__disgust	I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth .
__label__joy	Great . See you then .
__label__sadness	Oh , that's too bad ! I am sorry to hear that !
__label__joy	Bobby ! Come here , look what I got you !
__label__joy	That's the point . We should walk into the nature and enjoy its beauty whenever we have time .
__label__joy	Yeah , that is what the holiday is for , isn't it ?
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__joy	I love it when the weather is like this.Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
__label__surprise	Oh no ! Evaluations ! You can tell that's not my favorite job ; I haven't even started yet . When is the deadline for turning in thecompleted forms ?
__label__joy	I'm glad you liked it . Are you ready for dessert ?
__label__surprise	What do you mean ? It's expensive !
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__joy	Yes . It's superb .
__label__joy	He must be very brave .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__anger	Why are you so bitter ? No one tells worse joke than you .
__label__joy	I want to go traveling .
__label__joy	That's OK .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	It's nice meeting you too , Alice .
__label__joy	Is six o ’ clock okay ?
__label__fear	Yes , emergency . There is a huge fire here .
__label__joy	The pleasure is all mine .
__label__joy	She taught us that you can do anything that you want to do .
__label__joy	I wonder how long this weather can last .
__label__joy	Of course ! Peking Duck is world-famous . I would love to try it .
__label__joy	That ’ s very kind of you , Helen . I hope you don ’ t mind my leaving you like this . I need a holiday . It won ’ t be long .
__label__joy	It's very nice . There are only four people , and those girls are very kind and friendly .
__label__joy	Everything is now . I'm kind of sick of it .
__label__surprise	There are a lot of papers !
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , but we don't allow returns on sale items .
__label__joy	Thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview .
__label__joy	Do you still remember the small restaurant at the corner of the street ?
__label__joy	All right . I ’ m glad I could clarify things for you .
__label__anger	what a bummer ! You set me up ?
__label__joy	Wow , how exciting .
__label__joy	Ok . That sounds like a deal .
__label__surprise	So ?
__label__disgust	I found it very disappointing .
__label__joy	Great . I want to get an idea for the purchasing ability in various countries .
__label__joy	Is it waterproof ?
__label__surprise	Is she really ? I can ’ t believe it !
__label__anger	Excuse me , I ’ Ve been waiting my main dish for quite a time .
__label__joy	You are welcome , goodbye .
__label__joy	Do you have many friends ?
__label__joy	not today . She said she wanted us to relax tonight instead of doing homework ,
__label__joy	Just make sure children don ’ t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers .
__label__joy	You are welcome , Jack . Glad to be of help .
__label__joy	Wedding rings !
__label__anger	How dare you speak to me like this .
__label__joy	Great . Thanks so much for your time .
__label__joy	Yes . You really deserved this .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	great . i am your lucky fellow then .
__label__joy	yes . I bought a scarf yesterday . It's really nice and warm . Have a look .
__label__joy	I also brought a bottle of water and some provisions . If you are hungry , you can let me know .
__label__sadness	You know my father . If I fail , he'll kill me . I have to do well .
__label__joy	Thanks . I could eat a cow .
__label__anger	You think so ? Let ’ s take a chance !
__label__joy	good luck !
__label__joy	OK then . Well , I will work on my part and get back to you with my progress on Friday .
__label__joy	It was great . I had a really good time .
__label__joy	But what do you say about that ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally .
__label__sadness	I'm not sure , but I think so . I'm very exhaust but I can't sleep .
__label__sadness	Well , I'm really worried about my grades . I didn't think this course would be so stressful .
__label__joy	I'm pretty sure I'll be all right . In fact , I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you.What time are you planning to start ?
__label__joy	You too.Thanks for dropping in .
__label__joy	Autumn is also very nice in Washington .
__label__joy	Yes , they are .
__label__joy	I like hot food , especially Sichuan cuisine .
__label__joy	Don ’ t be silly , John . I ’ m going with you . It ’ s necessary for me to have a holiday too .
__label__joy	It sure is ! The water looks so nice ! Anchor the boat for a little while . I ’ m going to take a dip .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	How wonderful it would be if I had such smiles !
__label__surprise	Holly ? Holly Madison , is that you ? You look great ! You haven't changed a bit .
__label__joy	Are they coming to Chicago again ?
__label__joy	good luck !
__label__joy	Oh yes , I've heard of that one . Everyone I've spoken with says that it is great !
__label__anger	Leave me alone !
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome . I hope it'll come out well .
__label__joy	Thank you for your inviting me . See you then . Bye Tom .
__label__sadness	But she means a lot to me .
__label__joy	Since last time we've climbed the mountain , we haven't gone out for a long time .
__label__joy	Great . Good luck .
__label__joy	Jack ! Do you want to see a picture of my new puppy ?
__label__joy	Nice meeting you , Kevin . I hope to see you again .
__label__joy	Say hi to your family for me .
__label__surprise	What ? You golden watch is lost ?
__label__surprise	Are you nuts ? It's the President of the United States in lingerie !
__label__joy	Jenny , are you having fun here ?
__label__anger	How should I know ? It's just kind of cold in the middle . It just doesn't taste right . Do you want to try it ?
__label__joy	Thankyou . Goodbye !
__label__fear	Is it a horror movie ?
__label__joy	That's right . I know we have a complex system , but you have caught on so quickly .
__label__joy	Well done !

__label__joy	How do you do ?
__label__joy	Oh , I remember now.Very nice to meet you again .
__label__joy	That is so thoughtful of you .
__label__joy	Would you like to go to a concert tonight ?
__label__joy	Well , that is easy ! It sure beats waiting in line for ages waiting to deal with a real person !
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__anger	It is . Hurry up ! You ’ ll be late for school .
__label__anger	Why ? Isn't it obvious ? First you impose way too much on me , and I'm tired away . Second , you stood me up on the Valentine's Day .
__label__joy	That's OK . Thanks for your help .
__label__joy	Sounds great !
__label__anger	Oh , yes . I get six Korean channels but nothing in English !
__label__joy	You're lucky . Not everyone has such a great boss !
__label__joy	OK , got it ! Thank you so much . You have helped me a lot !
__label__joy	I assure you that you're paying for quality .
__label__joy	It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ?

__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	You dance beautifully too .
__label__anger	I have made a reservation for my breakfast last night . But I still haven't got it . I am so hungry now .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Great ! I will take it . And could you suggest a pair of trousers to match this sweater ?
__label__anger	I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that !
__label__joy	I always consider you are such a guy who never gives up .
__label__surprise	No kidding ! Didn't you study for it ?
__label__joy	Have you ever been to America ?
__label__sadness	I can't . I am really behind of my work .

__label__sadness	Sorry , sir . It's the sale price .
__label__joy	That seems very impressive . Good work !
__label__joy	I thought it was pretty good .
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? Isn't this spot C408 ?
__label__joy	Oh you ’ re exaggerating . I ’ m never really good at making hairdo .
__label__joy	Fantastic ! I can ’ t believe it ! That ’ s the biggest account we ’ Ve gotten so far !
__label__joy	I'll surely make introductions for them .
__label__joy	Oh , how nice ! there are bright rooms and the house is very quiet .
__label__joy	Alright . What do you want to do now ?
__label__joy	Oh , I went on a holiday in the city of Chende .
__label__surprise	Oh , no ! I'm leaving for Japan at 11 this morning .
__label__joy	Thanks ! Now I don ’ t need to come back to the shop a second time .
__label__joy	That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings .
__label__joy	It's pretty . May I try it on ?
__label__joy	Peak periods always entail hours of queuing . At least you got a nice tan though !
__label__joy	Yes , very much . Which one is the latest ?

__label__joy	Fabulous ! We should look at engagement rings then ! Now that ’ s a whole other section .
__label__sadness	I know . I wonder what's keeping him .
__label__joy	Welcome here again .
__label__joy	Thank you , have a nice day .
__label__joy	Of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though .
__label__joy	That's OK .
__label__surprise	What do you mean sick ? It was really funny , don't you think ?
__label__joy	I'm keen on talking short trips to nearby scenic spots . More often than not , I go with some of my friends . By the way , what are your favorites ?

__label__joy	Cool ! Anything else ?
__label__anger	You don ’ t love me , Roy .
__label__joy	I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings .
__label__joy	I like the old styles of dance . Such as fox-trot , waltz , rumba , tango and so on . They're all graceful .
__label__surprise	Oh , what a coincidence ! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it . He likes children and always wants a child of his own .
__label__joy	Pretty good . Please continue .
__label__joy	Here it is . But , what for ? We're already in .
__label__joy	See you .
__label__joy	Thanks , Miss . Wang .

__label__joy	Oh , no . As a matter of fact , I haven't danced for a long time .
__label__joy	Yes , I am . We ’ re thinking about getting engaged . We ’ Ve been dating for over a year now .

__label__surprise	Really ? I have heard there are many famous national park in the US , which one exactly ?
__label__joy	Pretty well , I think .

__label__joy	I will call again in twenty minutes . Thanks .
__label__joy	Yeah . That can be a good hobby .
__label__surprise	Really ? What did you think ?

__label__disgust	I can't help myself ; it's just so disgusting in here !
__label__joy	That's so great !
__label__joy	Yeah , this sucker is the fastest thing I've ever owned .
__label__joy	Guess what ! I know something you don't know !
__label__anger	Come on ! What have you got to lose ?
__label__joy	That does sound a lot of fun .
__label__joy	Come on , it's the weekend . Let's taste and enjoy this meal . Cheers !
__label__joy	OK . Great idea !
__label__fear	afraid of making a mistake .
__label__joy	Sure thing . I've got time .

__label__joy	Okay , let me brush you off . Thank you very much for coming .
__label__joy	Hello , I was just looking for the guide 。
__label__joy	Well , let's stop dragging our feet and find a Sichuan Hotpot restaurant for dinner !
__label__joy	$ 120.The small gift box is complementary .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	I love all the fashionable things . But my favorite brand is Chanel .
__label__joy	I loved it . I'll take it .
__label__joy	The sea is calm and peaceful . A sea trip is always enjoyable in fine weather like this .
__label__joy	Actually , it's not that good . I can read but I can't speak very well . I haven't had a lot of chance to practice .
__label__joy	Right ! I'll do it straight away .

__label__joy	That's a great idea . It's the best season for tourists in Florida . You can also get a good sun-tan there .
__label__disgust	But I don't think I'll ever show my liking to math .
__label__joy	Sure . Let ’ s go .
__label__joy	This is how a holiday should be . Relaxing on the beach with a nice cool drink .
__label__joy	It's about a girl . No , an angel ! I'm going to the coffee shop where she works right now .
__label__joy	That's a good idea . Let's go !
__label__joy	alright . See you later !
__label__joy	Thanks very much . I appreciate it .
__label__anger	How could you ? I reminded you just this morning .

__label__joy	I heard one observer even said ' It was a song sung in Spanish for international football , and he made it so popular that even the Americans loved it . '
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	That's exactly when I'll be away . It sounds ideal , as long as the landlord agrees .
__label__joy	I ’ m sure you ’ ll have fun no matter where you go . Remember to take your bag .
__label__joy	Sounds like a good idea . I love to play on the jungle gym .
__label__anger	Isn't it awful ? I can't bear to look at it . I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks .
__label__sadness	Nothing .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot for having us . We had a good time .
__label__joy	Haha , I could never do that . I ’ d be a zombie if I didn ’ t have my morning coffee fix . Let ’ s get down to business then .

__label__joy	Why don ’ t we go the cinema tonight ?
__label__sadness	I must apologize . I'll buy you a new one tomorrow .
__label__joy	yes , I do . Let ’ s go . We should be able to find something suitable . We should get him something old ... something historic .
__label__joy	Not only that , but I'm going to buy you that video game after all !
__label__joy	Yes , the Forrest's experience can encourage the people in trouble .
__label__joy	I'm glad to hear it .
__label__joy	In that case , I'll be seeing you .
__label__joy	It sounds like a really exciting city to live in .

__label__surprise	An apartment ? Why ?
__label__joy	So do I .
__label__joy	Hey Jane . How are you doing these days ?

__label__surprise	You what ?
__label__joy	That does sound pretty good .
__label__joy	You are very welcome . Come back again .
__label__anger	I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something .
__label__joy	Thank you . See you tomorrow .

__label__joy	No problem . Let me have one .
__label__joy	Sure we do ! We have the best tailors in the country ! What is it that you need exactly ?

__label__surprise	Oh , my god . I am so heavy now . I gain 10 kilos .
__label__joy	Great . Thanks .
__label__surprise	Oh really ? I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying . It ' s not that bad though , I mean , it is pretty scary to be in this big machine flying through the air at seven hundred miles per hour . I actually have arachnophobia .
__label__joy	Awesome . I've been giving this a lot of thought . When can we do this ?
__label__joy	Is that Hello Kitty ?
__label__joy	I'd like to , where ?
__label__sadness	My friend and I was argued with each other . For this , I ’ m very sad . Because I don ’ t want to lose this friend .

__label__surprise	Really ? That's great that you found a school that puts your need first .
__label__joy	Best wishes for you .
__label__anger	Well , he did it anyway . Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know .
__label__joy	Sure , we have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the sweater . Look at this section .
__label__joy	Welcome to my birthday party , I am so happy you can come .
__label__disgust	But many girls nowaday do want to marry a man filthy with dough .
__label__anger	If you do this again , don't even bother coming home .
__label__joy	Not much . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight .

__label__joy	I'd like to very much .
__label__joy	Merry Christmas , Mom . I love you .
__label__joy	No , we just don ’ t usually admit it !
__label__anger	It ’ s because of my son . Dick keeps getting on my nerves

__label__joy	Ella , it's been such a long week . I'm ready to go out and party . Hey , let's go out for a night on the town .
__label__joy	Don't mention it . You can come whenever You are free .
__label__joy	Hi , Mary . I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th , the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games . Is it true ?
__label__sadness	I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day .
__label__joy	That's wonderful news , thanks for all your help .

__label__joy	Can ’ t be better , it was wonderful . We had a lot of fun there . There was so much joy and walk and breathe the winter air . We arrived at the park at 9 o ’ clock in the morning and didn ’ t leave till 3 o ’ clock in the afternoon .
__label__joy	Cheers ! And we are honored to have such an honored guest today . Mr . James , I hope we will meet somewhere in the near future .
__label__joy	Sure , let's take a look . Sweetie , this is terrific . Your ideas are so original .
__label__joy	I'll never hurt you ; I'll never lie .

__label__joy	Oh , how nice.They ' re bright rooms and the house is very quiet .
__label__joy	Bye-bye . Visit us again soon !
__label__joy	well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world .
__label__anger	Anthony , you were caught making international calls from the office phone , you called in sick in eight times this month and you smell like alcohol !
__label__joy	Jessica is going back to Holland next week . I've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift , but I still have no clue .
__label__joy	Uh-huh .
__label__joy	OK . I understand . Thank you .
__label__joy	Can you imagine she's over forty ?
__label__joy	And I ’ m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn ’ t truly worthy .

__label__sadness	Oh , I'm sorry to hear that , sir . What exactly is problem ?
__label__joy	Because you are my dear wife .
__label__disgust	Just one night , when my flight was canceled due to bad weather . It ’ s bearable if you just need a place to crash , but you definitely don ’ t want to book a vacation there . Unless you enjoy sharing your room with cockroaches .
__label__surprise	Really ? I can't believe this . I am also keen on classic music . And do you know there is a concert of classic music tomorrow evening ?
__label__joy	When and where ?
__label__joy	How about some salad to go with your chicken ?
__label__surprise	Are you kidding ? It's winter . Why would I open it ?
__label__joy	Don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight .
__label__joy	Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month .
__label__joy	I love history , but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened .
__label__joy	Hi , Vince . Thanks for stopping by . How's the work coming along for the online auction ?
__label__joy	Happy Birthday , Mary !
__label__joy	Yeah , definitely . I was hoping to catch a ride with you .

__label__joy	I guess that is the thing we can do with we really want to visit the museum .
__label__anger	You've got so many cousins . I called you later that night . But you didn't have the guts to answer the phone .
__label__anger	Yeah right ! I ’ m serious ! You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! It ’ s really not healthy !

__label__joy	Mmm , it is reasonable . Look at this set of table wear , it is so beautiful !
__label__anger	You see , that ’ s what I ’ m talking about , I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore
__label__joy	It ’ s all so interesting . I ’ ll have to find more information about it on the internet . Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class .
__label__joy	Yes ! I finally lost that last five pounds I've been working on forever !
__label__surprise	You didn ’ t hear ? Spain won , two to zero .
__label__joy	Let ’ s meet at the park at 6:00 .
__label__anger	I didn't do anything .
__label__surprise	I can ’ t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice !
__label__surprise	Really ? How do you get the chance ?
__label__joy	Oh , yes . This is very nice . I'll take this one .
__label__joy	Yes , the autumn is marvelous here .
__label__joy	Hey , Jeanine , get a load of that . It's beautiful .
__label__disgust	I ’ m not crazy about it at all .
__label__joy	Yes , and I want to have a try .
__label__sadness	Well , I still hate having a curfew .
__label__joy	Mango juice would be perfect . Thank you !
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	That is very kind of you , Mr Lee . Thank you .
__label__joy	I believe in that . Well , the performance is about to begin . Let's be quiet .
__label__sadness	I'm very worried , doctor . I'm afraid that I'm very ill .
__label__joy	let me look . Let ’ s see ... they ’ Ve got one in blue , green , pink , black ... and white . Here you are .
__label__surprise	What a coincidence seeing you here . !
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Hi , Tom . You forgot to put on your sports shoes ! It's Games Day today !
__label__joy	Hey daddy ! You look great today . I like your tie ! By the way , I was wondering can I &
__label__joy	Yes , please do that .
__label__joy	Bye .
__label__anger	You went out and bought khakis , too !
__label__joy	Yep , my own special blend ! You can tell by just smelling them ?
__label__joy	That's great ! Thank you very much .
__label__joy	That would be great .
__label__sadness	But the lessons this semester are a little bit hard .
__label__joy	Mmmm , sounds like risky business . Good luck .
__label__surprise	Really ? How come ?
__label__surprise	It doesn ’ t matter . Oh , God , I have only four dollars in my wallet . Is that possible for me to buy one ?
__label__joy	sure , that would be great .
__label__surprise	I can't believe that there are girls who are willing to do that to their bodies . And all for a certain look .
__label__joy	Oh , how wonderful ! Every girl on the campus has a crush on those handsome guys .
__label__joy	Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner .
__label__fear	Too bad . I really like it .
__label__joy	Wonderful ! How much is the ticket ?
__label__joy	Good idea ! I think we could also have presentations by former students on how their experience here helped them in their lives .
__label__joy	OK . Here goes .
__label__surprise	Really ? What can I do ?
__label__joy	thanks . We should be ourselves . There are so many fashion victims out there .
__label__joy	It's a pleasure .
__label__surprise	You ’ re kidding me !
__label__joy	Guess what ? I've got great news !
__label__anger	Yeah , I'm afraid so .
__label__joy	Thank you for showing me your offices , Mr . Becker . I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs .
__label__joy	Janice , David , come here . We take some photos here . I can't imagine how beautiful it is !
__label__joy	Well , that's reasonable . I'll take it .
__label__disgust	Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ?
__label__joy	Yes . After so many years of hard work , I ’ d rather I had an office of my own .
__label__joy	You ’ Ve given me very valuable advice and I have more confidence in myself now . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Thank you for coming tonight , Mrs . Webber . As a teacher , it's great seeing the kid's parents assist our parent-teacher conference night .
__label__anger	To hell with you .
__label__sadness	Uh-oh . I'm in trouble .
__label__joy	How nice these frames are !
__label__joy	Hi Kate ... thanks ... wow ! Look at all the furniture . You must spent a fortune on it ! I love your new three-pieces suite .
__label__joy	That's true . Ok , I will think about it .
__label__joy	Don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself .
__label__joy	I've come to make sure that your stay in Beijing is a pleasant one .
__label__surprise	No , it can't be . Really ? Who ?
__label__joy	Can I bring my camera with me ?
__label__joy	Thank you for your purchase .
__label__anger	Could I see the manager please ? I have a complaint to make .
__label__joy	That sounds interesting . I ’ ll send a fax home . As soon as I receive a definite answer , I ’ ll make a specific inquiry .
__label__joy	Actually , I ’ Ve eaten soup dumplings in a lovely restaurant on Nanjing Lu . They were delicious !
__label__joy	With the greatest pleasure.Where is the concert this evening ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Would you please explain the meaning of the word ?
__label__disgust	It ’ s the worst thing I ’ Ve ever tried .
__label__joy	Oh , how adorable ! She's got your eyes .
__label__surprise	Was I ? Sorry , I didn'y mean to be . I do apologize .
__label__joy	Congratulations . How lucky you are !
__label__joy	Chicken salads are really good .
__label__surprise	What ? Beg your pardon .
__label__joy	I see . Thanks for these tips . We really need to buy a lot of little things .
__label__joy	I'm almost finished .
__label__joy	Call her on my cell phone . Wish her “ Happy Birthday ! ” Tell her you are out exploring the great American wilderness . Tell her I said she is lucky to be born on Independence Day .
__label__surprise	No kidding ! We'll miss the connecting flight .
__label__joy	That is very kind of you , Mr Lee . Thank you .
__label__joy	A couple of times .
__label__joy	Quite good except thinking of you so much .
__label__joy	Yeah . Two-toned , white and yellow .
__label__disgust	He makes me sick .
__label__sadness	Well , you know how I am about exams . I'm a perfectionist .
__label__joy	Snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets .
__label__joy	I really like the way this house looks .
__label__joy	Do you want something to drink ?
__label__joy	Of course , this way please .
__label__joy	Yes , in a monkey suit . It's adorable !
__label__joy	That sounds really attractive . Let's go to that candy shop now .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	I agree , I had lunch there last week .
__label__joy	Good idea . I will take the racket .
__label__joy	Certainly I can , I'll buy some from butchers ' and cook for you next sunday .
__label__joy	No , thank you .
__label__joy	Thank you . I ’ ll be right back .
__label__sadness	That ’ s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather .
__label__joy	Let me see . It's not an eagle . I think it's a vulture .
__label__joy	OK , goodbye .
__label__joy	That's Okay , I think .
__label__joy	The weather in Beijing is just beautiful !
__label__disgust	That's disgusting .
__label__anger	So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
__label__joy	That ’ s really a good phenomenon to see .
__label__joy	Have a nice day , and thank you for shopping here .
__label__joy	I love to dance the fast music .
__label__joy	On my first trip I went to Tokyo , and on my second trip I visited Kyoto .
__label__disgust	I'm sorry , but I can't ! That's something my grandmother would sing !
__label__surprise	Recliner ? In my beautifully decorated living room ? I don ’ t think so !
__label__anger	I'm serious , Zina . Back off . I have a bottle of pepper spray in my pocket .
__label__joy	All right.That sounds more interesting .
__label__fear	But I've never jumped off anything in my life . The highest thing I've jumped off is my bed . I'm scared .
__label__joy	And I was overwhelmed by this scene , too .
__label__joy	Really , that's good .
__label__joy	It's nice , but how much did you end up paying ?
__label__joy	How do you do ?
__label__sadness	I'm very busy these days . It seems I can never finish my work .
__label__surprise	Really ? How long have you been playing piano ?
__label__joy	Sounds good .
__label__joy	what do you think about this store ? I heard it ’ s a posh store that ’ s only got branches in big cities .
__label__joy	We should do this more often .
__label__joy	I see what you mean . That was pretty easy after all .
__label__anger	Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case .
__label__joy	your muscles are a spectacle !
__label__joy	OK . Here are your robes . You can go shower first .
__label__joy	Goodbye .
__label__joy	Oh , that's funny !
__label__joy	Thank you for noticing ! I've been making a few lifestyle changes over the past year .
__label__joy	You should go to the park more often since you don't go to the gym anymore !
__label__anger	"You know , it's OK for a girl to forget these "" big days "" , but for a guy , to do that is unforgivable ."
__label__joy	The fringe benefits in your company are excellent , and it's generous of you to offer five insurances and one fund
__label__anger	What does that have to do with those men shooting at us ? Most importantly , why did you lie to me !
__label__sadness	So sorry , I don't mean to be .
__label__joy	And you think about her all the time ?
__label__joy	Nice ! Brunch !
__label__joy	Just fine , thanks.And you ?
__label__joy	How about 6:00 ?
__label__joy	Ok , I see . Thank you !
__label__joy	Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions .
__label__joy	That sounds like a good idea !
__label__joy	Of course . Do you want to see it ?
__label__joy	I got it as a gift so I couldn't take it back . Good luck ! I hope it will fit you !
__label__surprise	I just went to bed !
__label__joy	Good . I prefer beef soup .
__label__joy	You ’ re a wonderful person , Kathleen .
__label__surprise	Caterpillar fungus ? ! What the heck is that ?
__label__sadness	Yeah , I ’ m better after talking to you .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot . I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon , too . You ’ Ve been doing some great work !
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__disgust	Bull . I're done my research . I know you still control more than 65 percent of invoking options .
__label__disgust	I don ’ t really like Henry . I like my Rose .
__label__joy	I feel as if I'm living in a different world , honey .
__label__surprise	Yeah ? Why ? Don ’ t you like living with me ?
__label__sadness	oh , I'm sorry to bother you .
__label__joy	The same to you !
__label__joy	Yes , we ate a delicious meal and drank some very good wine .
__label__surprise	But why ? Since you like it so much .
__label__disgust	Do you think so ? I don't like it very much . I found it rather uncomfortable .
__label__joy	I love winter , I love snow .
__label__joy	Yesterday . I was really sorry to see it end . The skiing was terrific !
__label__joy	Thank you . ( A moment later ) Oh , this one is quite impressive . I'll take it . By the way , do you sell pearl earrings ?
__label__anger	Really , Mary , you ’ re horrible .
__label__anger	Shame on you . I was saving them for your brother .
__label__joy	That sounds good to me .
__label__joy	It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ?
__label__sadness	Yeah , but that's not why I am upset . I just found out another guy got a promotion . He doesn't know how to do anything . He sits there and kisses the managers butt all day long .
__label__surprise	Really ? I'm so glad to hear that.But I don't know how to get access to the Internet.Could you show me ?
__label__joy	Yeah , and meet other drivers of the same car !
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	Wow , it stars Catherine Zeta-Jones , my favorite actress .
__label__joy	It's Chinese New Year ! That means it's time to eat hot pot !
__label__joy	I'll pick you up .
__label__surprise	Seriously ?
__label__anger	And his story didn't even hold together . I feel such an idiot .
__label__joy	A good choice . I prefer that one myself .
__label__joy	great . Shall I meet you there around 7:45 tomorrow night ?
__label__sadness	Thank you . But a number of things have been going wrong lately .
__label__joy	His parents must feel very happy .
__label__joy	Come on , fellows . Let's enjoy my wife's cooking !
__label__joy	Great . Would you like coffee or tea with that ?
__label__joy	That sounds great . Thanks .
__label__joy	Thanks . Come back here next Wednesday to pick up your order , please .
__label__joy	Yes , I guess it was a choice of me or the pigeons !
__label__surprise	Gee . I must have left it in my hotel room .
__label__joy	Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ?
__label__joy	Oh , the smelly bean curd . My favorite !
__label__anger	No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here .
__label__joy	Yes I am . I got married five years ago .
__label__joy	That ’ s interesting . They must be thinking of moving into that market . Are there any interesting editorials ?
__label__joy	I propose a toast to your pleasant tour in China .
__label__joy	Yes , of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
__label__joy	Here you are . You look younger in yellow .
__label__joy	You were doing great out there !
__label__joy	Next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine .
__label__joy	I ’ m glad this car is an automatic . I don't like having to change gears .
__label__joy	We have a great variety of Chinese antiques and porcelain . Do you like them ?
__label__joy	So I think I may fall in love with her .
__label__joy	That's good .
__label__joy	Get ready for the best meal of your life !
__label__anger	To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck !
__label__joy	Certainly I do .
__label__joy	Yes , of course . And I'm amazed the those karate and judo boys were so helpless before the wrestlers .
__label__joy	Thank you ! Your cheeks are as red as a tomato ! Are you shy ?
__label__sadness	It seems to me like I may have caught a bug .
__label__joy	And I must thank you again for your generous help .
__label__joy	I find the Chinese dishes wonderful .
__label__surprise	Really ? What makes you say that ?
__label__joy	You're dancing so well .
__label__joy	Well , that dress certainly shows your good taste . It must have cost a lot .
__label__joy	That ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . I ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew . Oh , they look so cute !
__label__joy	Very impressive . And I do like the leading actress who has an amazing voice .
__label__joy	All right . this suits my taste best . I'II take It .
__label__surprise	It's huge !
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome .
__label__surprise	That's a lot of money ! What did you do ? Break the piggy bank ?
__label__joy	It's on me .
__label__sadness	what a pity .
__label__joy	It is so nice of you .
__label__joy	That's good.Cotton is soft and flexible .
__label__anger	Yes . But why do I have to fill out a form anyway ? This is the emergency room .
__label__sadness	He asked me to beef up in the work .
__label__joy	Yeah .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__sadness	Sorry , we can ’ t come down any more .
__label__joy	Good idea !
__label__joy	"Hopefully , you'll say "" yes "" ..."
__label__joy	Right , thanks .
__label__joy	And how ’ s your brother ?
__label__joy	I think Pond's is the best .
__label__joy	I will miss you , too . You're really a good friend .
__label__joy	OK , Mum . I'll invite my friends home .
__label__joy	It's a clear spirit we drink any time of the day . You will love it !
__label__joy	Yes , totally . It's nice to meet a customer who understands the system .
__label__joy	Great ! Then I suppose I'm looking forward to my first promotion , too .
__label__fear	Oh , my god ! No air-conditioner !
__label__joy	Not at all.This dress certainly shows your good taste .
__label__joy	Thank you . Now if you'll just give me a credit card .
__label__joy	Thanks , sir . You too . Drive safely , I hear there ’ s a lot ice on the roads .
__label__sadness	I'm really sorry I let you down . I'll make it up to you somehow .
__label__joy	Really ! Oh , honey , you are so sweet . I'll chop up this carrot .
__label__sadness	The dog bit the delivery boy .
__label__joy	Yes , that ’ s all right . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	That's wonderful !
__label__joy	Because you're going to love this show !
__label__joy	Good for you , Leslie !
__label__joy	I ’ ll drink to that !
__label__joy	You did ? that is great !
__label__joy	No matter what I do , I'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat !
__label__surprise	I can't believe it ! Is it real ? You're moving here ?
__label__joy	They are . I read a story about a dolphin saving a A from drowning in the sea .
__label__anger	Come home late one more time , and you'll find your stuff outside .
__label__joy	All the food smells tasty today and makes my mouth water .
__label__joy	You are right . They sweep Nancy off her feet . And now she fell head over heels in love with him .
__label__joy	Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know .
__label__joy	It ’ s a small world ! May I know your name , miss ?
__label__joy	Cool ! Also amongst the winners is Petra , in Jordan , Mach Pitch in Peru and the pyramid in Chichenitza in Mexico .
__label__joy	Yeah . It ’ s exciting . This month we ’ re doing crossword puzzles .
__label__joy	Not at all .
__label__joy	I like talking to you , too .
__label__disgust	Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it .
__label__joy	That's great . Anything else ?
__label__surprise	You are crazy . Gambling is against my principles .
__label__anger	Don ’ t throw your weight around . I can ’ t bear you any more .
__label__joy	Sure . I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year .
__label__joy	Yes , please . Thank you for everything .
__label__joy	No problem , sir . But it will cost you extra .
__label__joy	Here you are .
__label__joy	We are going to have a picnic tomorrow at the picnic center .
__label__surprise	Really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid .
__label__sadness	My mistake .
__label__joy	I really admire you for that . How is it going ?
__label__disgust	to be honest , I'm really fed up with work at the moment . I need a break !
__label__joy	Wow , that should be really exciting , especially with so many famous athletes there .
__label__joy	Thank you , Miss Kelly .
__label__joy	Happy Birthday , Mary !
__label__joy	Here's your change and receipt . Thank you .
__label__joy	And stay in the shallow area . I don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__sadness	My manager jumped on me for my mistake today .
__label__surprise	Oh , no .
__label__joy	Okay , I ’ Ve decided . I ’ m going to pop the question !
__label__joy	Yeah . That ’ s a good idea and you like to cook . What about the books ?
__label__surprise	Really ? I ' m so sorry I bothered you . I ' ll try again .
__label__joy	Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed .
__label__joy	I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ?
__label__joy	That's wonderful . I want to get a part-time job too . Tell me what I should do .
__label__fear	Are you serious ? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! It disgusts me .
__label__surprise	Really ? What is it ?
__label__joy	Thank you . May I suggest you to trim your eyebrows ?
__label__joy	What a surprise ! Thanks.It ' s beautiful .
__label__surprise	Toys ? Why do we need toys for a picnic ?
__label__surprise	But yesterday you said you would rent it .
__label__surprise	I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?
__label__joy	He ’ s quite particular about what he wears , especially about his ties . He gets different tie each day .
__label__joy	Judy , your husband has a really nice car .
__label__joy	Mrs.Smith , time has stood still with you !
__label__joy	enjoy yourself .
__label__joy	I love that kind of stuff .
__label__joy	Two weeks
__label__sadness	Well , it could be me too . But I am not too worried . This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . It would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place .
__label__joy	Thanks . I'm glad that I did a good job .
__label__joy	No , not at all . It looks really classy on you . Where did you pick that up ?
__label__joy	That would be great .
__label__joy	hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world .
__label__joy	It's a deal .
__label__joy	I got a raise .
__label__joy	I'm glad you like it .
__label__joy	Thank you . That's very kind of you .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , but the price is final .
__label__joy	Yes , Steven . You always know what I want .
__label__surprise	Really ? Tell me about it . What's it like ?
__label__joy	Uh , actually , I've gone twice this week .
__label__joy	Good luck !
__label__joy	You big scrooge !
__label__anger	I'm about to be swept away by millions of cockroaches !
__label__surprise	That is truly amazing !
__label__joy	Wow , what a great burd !
__label__joy	You're in luck . We still have that little table .
__label__joy	I like my hair so much .
__label__joy	Ok , we live in the third building on your left . Will we see you around 7 pm ?
__label__surprise	Oh , I don't think you're shy ! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party .
__label__joy	Thanks , I appreciate that !
__label__joy	Thank you.That ' s a good idea.she likes exciting books.Can you suggest another one ?
__label__joy	Don ’ t you worry , I ’ ll take care of everything ! Oh my god ! I just love your curly hair ! It ’ s so fluffy and cute ! You should totally let it grow out . An afro would look great on you !
__label__joy	I promise !
__label__joy	Oh , really ? But you're doing the tango wonderfully well .
__label__joy	I ’ m excited to be here .
__label__sadness	I ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off .
__label__joy	That's true . Cycling is good for our environment , too . Let me just get my helmet then .
__label__joy	Ok . I'll take it . Here's the money .
__label__joy	I love the relaxing colors in the tile and floor covering !
__label__joy	Hey , let's go to the night market after work tonight .
__label__joy	Don't mention it .
__label__disgust	I don't know why Mark often comes to me and asks me for advice . I smell some rat in it .
__label__surprise	And the winner is ... Vivian , again ! I don't believe it !
__label__joy	It's excellent .
__label__joy	I'd be glad to .
__label__joy	Hi , Jenny ! Jason here . It's great to hear your voice again .
__label__joy	We could try that , but I really want this house !
__label__joy	Great minds think alike .
__label__joy	Sure . I ought to be ready for some more drinks by then.Thank you for calling .
__label__sadness	My house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture .
__label__surprise	Did you ? And what did you study ?
__label__sadness	That ’ s a pity . We can arrange another time hopefully .
__label__joy	No , that's all . Thanks .
__label__joy	Lily , can you take part in our picnic this weekend ?
__label__sadness	I'm sorry . We're still going . I got reservations for all of us on the 31st . It will be OK . Trust me .
__label__joy	That ’ s a good idea .
__label__joy	His name is Tony and we met my first night in Pathos . He works with my sister who lives there .
__label__joy	Do you feel like going to see Paul and Claire tonight ?
__label__surprise	I ’ d like to use my Master Card , if I could . Hey , wait a minute ! This is a bit more than I expected . Why is it so high ?
__label__joy	The fish was pretty special , but I loved the dessert .
__label__joy	Ok . Take care . I hope you have a good journey .
__label__disgust	Yes . I think I won't come here again next time .
__label__joy	It's an excellent one . I like it very much .
__label__surprise	A crazy language ? Why do you say that ?
__label__joy	You are really a man who knows how to enjoy being alone .
__label__joy	Say , Anna , what are you doing tonight ? Would you like to go out ?
__label__joy	OK , well , let me just get my coat and we'll go to the diner around the corner .
__label__joy	No , thanks .
__label__joy	Fun for you ! Do you get to do anything you want ?
__label__joy	Great . Where can I get an application form ?
__label__joy	Thanks for letting me know , home-girl .
__label__joy	Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike .
__label__surprise	Why ? You were a real movie buff when you were a student .
__label__joy	They're here ! Now that's speedy service ! And they arrived within two days of each other !
__label__sadness	Oh , I'm sorry .
__label__joy	Just take your golf club . I will pick you up Borrow .
__label__joy	Sounds like fun . You can count me in ! Just give me directions to the restaurant .
__label__joy	We'd like to . Can you tell me when we go ?
__label__joy	Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it .
__label__joy	Thank you for joining us ! Now let's see some pictures and know more about kung fu .
__label__joy	Tony looks very handsome in the suit .
__label__joy	Nice to meet you Mr . Taylor .
__label__joy	Yes , it ’ s a really nice neighborhood .
__label__joy	I have a special assignment coming up . Would you be interested in helping me on it ?
__label__joy	It tastes great .
__label__joy	Okay , see you tomorrow !
__label__joy	You're very welcome .
__label__joy	It ’ s absolutely incredible . I ’ ll take it .
__label__joy	Maybe you don't believe it , but it was made by my grandmother .
__label__anger	I know I'm a blabbermouth , but what do you think she should do , John ?
__label__joy	That would be great ! Thanks for your help . Can I buy you coffee ?
__label__joy	I hope you enjoy your purchase . Good-bye .
__label__joy	Thank you , but I'm just browsing today .
__label__joy	That's a good idea . Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius ?
__label__joy	Around seven .
__label__disgust	It's no use complaining.If we had got enough money , we wouldn't put up with it !
__label__surprise	Not much . What a surprise to see you here .
__label__joy	Nice to see you with us , Anne.Please make yourself at home .
__label__joy	Oh , what a beautiful garden !
__label__joy	It is very convenient . You know you can browse the website and send e-mails to your customers at any time .
__label__joy	That's a waltz . Would you like to try it ?
__label__sadness	I know , Mr . Douglas . But I am really sick .
__label__joy	Nice to see you , too , Steven . Goodbye .
__label__joy	Good . How much is a one-way ticket ?
__label__joy	Actually , are you doing anything on Friday or Saturday ? He's playing those two nights as well .
__label__surprise	It's only the rarest coffee in the world ! Didn't your momma teach you anything when you were growing up ?
__label__joy	Yes . We can do something else if you like .
__label__joy	oh , you know me . I ’ m always happy ! If I think I ’ m getting into a bad mood , I call some friends and socialize or have a chat .
__label__disgust	Oh , don't talk to me about yesterday ! It was the most awful evening I've ever had .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry for running it , but I really didn't know .
__label__joy	Yes , quite right .
__label__sadness	Let me see ... Oh , I am awfully sorry sir .
__label__joy	Cool ! What brand
__label__joy	That'll be for you to decide . I've got a new dish that I want to try out on you .
__label__joy	Wow ! You're right . Everything is absolutely delicious . Please pass the pepper .
__label__joy	Just go ! It's Valentine's Day !
__label__surprise	Ahahah ! What is that thing on your couch ! It just moved !
__label__sadness	Sorry , Mr . Polly .
__label__joy	Thanks again for buying the tickets . That was the most exciting live concert I've ever seen . That silver electric guitar was really cool .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry ; he's out at the moment .
__label__joy	Hey ! I have a surprise for you .
__label__joy	Good morning , Mei ! How are you ?
__label__joy	Morning , Lee . How are you ?
__label__joy	That's a good idea .
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? Do you know which company they are from ?
__label__surprise	Are you serious ?
__label__sadness	Yes , a low fever . I feel terrible . Am I dying ?
__label__joy	Oh , never mind . I am just going to do the laundry today .
__label__joy	Rose , the weekend is coming . Let's discuss what we will do .
__label__disgust	Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards .
__label__surprise	Oh , what's that ?
__label__surprise	oh , really ?
__label__surprise	It ’ s the same in Balloon . But I definitely think we over-tipped the cab driver . The fare was twenty dollars , and you gave him a five-dollar tip . That ’ s twenty-five percent of the total ! Too much !
__label__joy	Yeah . Falling in love is so good !
__label__joy	Looks good .
__label__joy	That sounds really convenient . Do you pay extra money to enjoy this service ?
__label__joy	All right . By the way , do you often dance ?
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__surprise	That's impossible ! I'm talking about Mister Taylor Smith .
__label__joy	Will we drive to the seaside ?
__label__surprise	Really ? Well , anyway , they pointed their guns at him and said , you know , keep calm and drive out . ... we don't want to hurt you ... we just want your car .
__label__joy	Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
__label__joy	Merry Christmas !
__label__joy	I didn't know you liked bird-watching .
__label__joy	Wow ! It's just what I wanted !
__label__joy	A hike would be great ! Let me pack us a nice picnic lunch , OK ?
__label__joy	I certainly can . If I can get some from the butcher ’ s , I ’ ll cook them for you .
__label__surprise	Oh , my ! Really ? I never thought he would be like that .
__label__joy	This is a very good meeting , Liz .
__label__joy	I should be done by Friday . I ’ ll give it to you in class then .
__label__surprise	Avril Lavigen !
__label__joy	Well , thank you for your information . What ’ s the name of that restaurant again ?
__label__joy	Do you mean it ? I'd love to !
__label__joy	Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?
__label__joy	There is a beautiful state park here . I can see why so many people come out here to camp .
__label__joy	That's settled then . I'll contact you later .
__label__joy	Well , children usually resemble their parents .
__label__joy	It was great . I made some friends .
__label__joy	But you're ready for everything else ?
__label__joy	that ’ s a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense .
__label__anger	They ’ re really running you into the ground . Why don ’ t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere .
__label__joy	ok .
__label__joy	She ’ s my wife ! Oh , here ’ s my floor ! Nice talking to you . Goodbye .
__label__joy	It's surely worth going to . There are ten famous spots there .
__label__joy	That sounds like a good idea ! But I'm afraid my mom will be angry about it .
__label__joy	That ’ s right . I have a lot to learn from you .
__label__joy	You are very skillful driver .
__label__disgust	You have asked me several times about it . You are driving me up the wall .
__label__anger	Cockroaches have declared war on my room !
__label__joy	How about coming with me to meet my American friends ?
__label__joy	Yeah , I agree . It makes you feel really good .
__label__joy	By all means .
__label__surprise	No , really ?
__label__anger	Mom ! I hate eating vegetables !
__label__disgust	Not everything , just this film . Even the title is ridiculous . and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
__label__joy	It was funny .
__label__joy	My pleasure . Welcome to our restaurant next time .
__label__joy	thank you very much .
__label__sadness	I ’ m afraid not . I apologize .
__label__joy	Yes , great . I am happy you are coming .
__label__joy	That ’ s all right . Thank you all the same .
__label__joy	Thank you . Come back to my office at the same time tomorrow . I'll have the pictures ready by then .
__label__joy	sure , it's the ad circled with a red pen in the middle of the classifieds . Good luck !
__label__joy	yes . You always have a good nose for wines .
__label__joy	All right . Say cheese !
__label__joy	Mom , happy Mother's Day ! A necklace for you .
__label__joy	Are you ready to welcome him ?
__label__joy	That Kenmore looks nice .
__label__surprise	Seriously ?
__label__joy	Sure do ! This one is a quarterly publication , but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas !
__label__joy	Bon voyage !
__label__joy	No wonder people say , Even the immortals would rather be Guiliners .
__label__joy	It was nice talking to you too .
__label__joy	There you can see british leaders , entertainers , criminals , and royalty .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Don't mention it .
__label__anger	Are you serious ? I have to pay $ 2 for a movie I never watched ?
__label__surprise	Why ? What's wrong ?
__label__anger	You only say that because you don't have to work with him.The people in your department seem so capable and nice to be around.Take Mary for example.She ' s smart and enthusiastic . I've never met anyone as cheery as she is .
__label__anger	I can ’ t believe it ! I have all my important personal documents stored in that computer . It ’ s no laughing matter .
__label__surprise	I just cann't believe my ears !
__label__anger	What did you think you were doing ?
__label__joy	That's for sure . You know , I had the greatest time ever .
__label__joy	That ’ s good . Is the location easily accessible ?
__label__joy	What would you like to drink ?
__label__joy	Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ?
__label__joy	Hello again ! Here's another fruit tray for you .
__label__joy	Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station .
__label__anger	Listen , I know who you are . If you call this number again , I ’ ll call the police . You ’ ll be arrested . I ’ Ve got your number .
__label__joy	It's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city .
__label__joy	My pleasure .
__label__sadness	I'm afraid you'll have to find a parking meter .
__label__joy	Yes . She dressed with an individual flair . I rather envy her .
__label__joy	Yes , of course . This way , please .
__label__joy	Thank you , I really do appreciate that .
__label__joy	Here is the programme . Check it out yourself !
__label__anger	But it will be expensive to have a car in the city , won't it ?
__label__surprise	Really ? And Chris ? She was a very pretty little girl .
__label__joy	Ok , it's a date then !
__label__surprise	Yes . Oh , dear , I can ’ t find my hairbrushes . Can you help me ?
__label__joy	Thanks again .
__label__joy	Absolutely , I love temple fairs . Beijing has several temple fairs recently . They are different from each other to some extent , but also have a lot in common .
__label__sadness	My fish is pretty dry too .
__label__joy	It must be interesting .
__label__sadness	Sorry , I don ’ t know the rule about punching .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	I like that .
__label__surprise	I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall .
__label__joy	Let ’ s fix it at seven o'clock , OK ?
__label__joy	Thank you . I'm sure I will have a wonderful time here .
__label__surprise	You're moving now ? I knew you were moving , but I thought you said you were moving next month .
__label__joy	I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature .
__label__joy	I don't know . I'm too excited to say a word .
__label__joy	I can never forget that . I bought you five candies , but I was so anxious that I forgot to give them to you . You didn't get them until we parted . Then they had already melted down for I held them the whole time .
__label__joy	You're right . Mother's love is the greatest love in the world .
__label__joy	I'm glad you say so . You dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got you as a partner .
__label__surprise	It's really a surprise .
__label__joy	Thank you for your praise .
__label__surprise	Sure , no problem . Is your prescription ready ?
__label__joy	Thank you . I appreciate the compliment .
__label__joy	You are welcome .
__label__joy	Yes , I do . I know a place that has excellent food .
__label__joy	Thank you . I ’ m leaving tomorrow morning .
__label__surprise	It's unbelievable ! They are only married for one month . Then who is at fault ?
__label__disgust	I meet too many jerks .
__label__joy	Can we go to the Carlton next time and can you wear that fabulous suit ?
__label__joy	That means a lot to me Dad . Thanks .
__label__joy	That's great . It's most thoughtful of you to do this , Miss Rose .
__label__joy	Maybe he shouldn ’ t come to collage , he should become a football star .
__label__joy	He is such a handsome guy . He gets his looks from his mother of course !
__label__joy	Any time .
__label__joy	Wow ! Your calligraphy is very beautiful . It was worth the wait !
__label__joy	Then I bet he's really good !
__label__joy	Good idea .
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__anger	Just get out of my face , would you ?
__label__joy	Wow ! It's a fruit sculpture ! Your chef is a real artist !
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome .
__label__surprise	I'm a TV announcer . Don't you recognize me ? I do the weather report on KNT !
__label__anger	No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too .
__label__joy	Alright . Bye .
__label__joy	You are welcome .
__label__joy	It's no big deal .
__label__joy	Good idea ! In this way , our clients ' needs will be met and disagreements between the two parties avoided .
__label__joy	The sooner the better ! I can ’ t wait !
__label__joy	Friday at 6 pm . would be perfect .
__label__surprise	I didn ’ t think he would .
__label__joy	It was one of the best times in my life . It was tough , but I made it . I became a college graduate .
__label__joy	Congratulations ! You've just won a car !
__label__joy	Well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ?
__label__anger	It really hurts .
__label__joy	That's the one . A bunch of us are going there for dinner tomorrow night.How about coming with us ?
__label__joy	Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
__label__sadness	John , I am just not in the mood for this .
__label__anger	Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ?
__label__joy	Alright , all joking aside , what kinds of moves do you like ?
__label__joy	We still have most of the tickets we bought.We can go on a lot of different rides if you like .
__label__sadness	I didn't pass the English exam . How to learn English well ? Can you give me some suggestions ?
__label__joy	You are welcome .
__label__joy	And so , that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year . Thank you very much for your time .
__label__joy	He asked me out to a dinner tonight . How about joining us ?
__label__joy	I like all kinds as long as they are exciting .
__label__joy	OK , I'Il go with you . When shall we go ?
__label__surprise	Why not ! It ’ s a classic ; in fact , it ’ s one of my favorite novels .
__label__surprise	I can ’ t believe it !
__label__joy	I'll come back to China tonight . I hope to see you again sometime .
__label__joy	It's OK , so I send you this .
__label__joy	I like the colour very much . It's a lovely dress , but it's too small for me .
__label__joy	Mmm . Nice and crunchy . And they leave a space uncovered for you to hold ...
__label__joy	I'm glad you saw the reason .
__label__joy	Thank you . I ’ m leaving tomorrow morning .
__label__joy	Yes . I ’ Ve won the first prize in the math contest .
__label__joy	You know that everybody notices how beautiful you are , don't you ?
__label__joy	I can't agree more , honey . We need to get away from work from time to time .
__label__anger	I know I ’ m going to bite the dust going down this hill . I almost got killed on the chair lift ! This is going to be so embarrassing .
__label__sadness	I wish my parents were a little more lenient .
__label__joy	That is very kind of you , Mr Lee . Thank you .
__label__joy	That's pretty cool . How much of a discount ?
__label__joy	Fine .
__label__joy	Thanks . That is a good suggestion .
__label__joy	Why , thank you . I wasn't sure if it looked okay or not . I can't believe all the words the salesgirl said .
__label__disgust	He's endless talking about stocks almost bores me to death .
__label__sadness	Not very well .
__label__joy	Wow ! I'm so happy for you .
__label__joy	Are you enjoying your trip to New Orleans ?
__label__joy	I guess we have covered all the stuff that we need to discuss and it's time to say goodbye .
__label__joy	That sounds great . I'll have that one then .
__label__joy	Sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ?
__label__joy	That sounds good . How are you doing , Linda ?
__label__joy	We can do that if you like . Maybe next weekend .
__label__anger	Ur , you really let me down .
__label__sadness	I'm afraid not , sir .
__label__surprise	How terrible ! This is quite unexpected !
__label__joy	Thank you very much . Bye .
__label__joy	I think that's an excellent reason to like something .
__label__joy	OK , follow me .
__label__joy	I like playing basketball . Basketball is a very exciting game because it keeps you alert and I also enjoy the team spirit of basketball .
__label__joy	I guess so .
__label__joy	No , thanks . You've done a lot for us . Thank you for everything .
__label__joy	That's so simple . I'll come by my local branch later this afternoon and get it set up . Thank you very much , Tina .
__label__joy	that's a good idea . I ’ ll look into finding something like that .
__label__joy	Right ! Glad to see you here .
__label__joy	Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun , too .
__label__joy	Me too . Swimming is a very good exercise for health . It combines water , bath , sunbath , and air bath together . It promotes the growth and haleness of muscles , bone , viscera and nerve systems .
__label__joy	I want to skip desert.That all , thank you .
__label__anger	Well , you should be sorry ! Don ’ t ever use my computer again ! You can ’ t do anything now , it ’ s too late !
__label__joy	Let me see . How about 6:30 at the gate of the club ?
__label__joy	Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough !
__label__joy	I can still remember our first date .
__label__joy	I don't feel like going out tonight , I am way too tired . I miss you , sweetheart .
__label__joy	Cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar !
__label__joy	Yes , you're right . I can blog wherever and whenever I'm on the move . It's especially good when I'm on a business trip and my laptop happens to be away from me .
__label__joy	Here you go then . Have a great school year !
__label__joy	Donna ? Well . She is about 20 . She is very lovely and I think you will like her . What about Paul ?
__label__joy	He certainly looks interested , doesn ’ t he ? Shall we invite him over to our table ?
__label__surprise	Really ? I had no idea . Let me check.Yes , it's dead . There's no dial tone .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__surprise	What ?
__label__sadness	Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
__label__joy	I am sorry I am so late to work .
__label__joy	I think is looks great . I really like the light colors you have chosen . The pictures are nice too . Did you buy any new furniture ?
__label__joy	Would you like another beer ?
__label__joy	Well , if I simply want to write a few words , I'll send it by email or edit it all from the cell phone browser .
__label__anger	Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon !
__label__disgust	He sounds like a sick cow !
__label__joy	That's very clear . I think I can find my way now.Thank you .
__label__joy	He's diving for the gold .
__label__joy	A chance ? Not just a chance , I'm a hundred percent certain.Everyone says my voice is beautiful .
__label__joy	No , that's it . Thanks . I really appreciate it .
__label__joy	Great , I ’ ll see you then .
__label__joy	It sounds good . You can do a lot of sightseeing , too .
__label__joy	Hey ! A real cook gets down and dirty . Besides , I think I look good covered in baking mix ...
__label__joy	Thank you , but no . This will do it for now .
__label__surprise	What ! ? It'll be a miracle if we're ready by the end of the month ! Is she crazy ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much . I will devote all my efforts to my work .
__label__joy	I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself .
__label__joy	Good choice ! Our ground beef is extra lean , if you know what I mean .
__label__joy	I'm fine , thanks . And you ?
__label__joy	Thanks . I think I will try . Where are you going ?
__label__joy	Well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing . I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . Bicycling home after work can help release your stress . Life in the offices is miserable . You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road . Just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . How great !
__label__joy	Thank you very much , sir .
__label__joy	Okay , thanks very much .
__label__joy	You are such an expert on it . I don't know that .
__label__joy	Thank you , Mr . Davis .
__label__joy	Sure , I'm looking forward to it .
__label__surprise	Really ? Come on , I'll introduce them to you .
__label__joy	They are good , but i still need a few more .
__label__joy	Good luck with that !
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	I see . Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Daniel , you know ? Lisa has invited us to have dinner this afternoon .
__label__anger	You always have a chip on your shoulder .
__label__joy	It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game .
__label__joy	Thank you . How long it take to get my son's hair cut ?
__label__joy	That's my favorite .
__label__joy	I think it might be a good idea to work as a guide .
__label__joy	Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ?
__label__joy	Hello ! Let me introduce myself . My name is Nancy .
__label__surprise	Are you kidding ? That's the stupidest gift one can buy . I don't want to get a tie .
__label__disgust	That ’ s not all ! I also had to finish writing a sales report for my boss . In the end , I finished everything . I wonder what will be waiting for me tomorrow morning .
__label__joy	Let ’ s go to Chicago.We can have lunch in Chinatown.Then we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field !
__label__joy	That's not bad . Let's go .
__label__joy	Thank you . Here is the ticket and receipt . Have a good time .
__label__joy	My pleasure . Release the parking brake , and we're almost ready to go .
__label__joy	You're lucky . It's hard to find a place to stay at the beach in August
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Our company's wei-ya is tomorrow night ! It's your first Chinese New Year in Taiwan--you must be excited !
__label__joy	It ’ s very kind of you .
__label__joy	Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too .
__label__joy	thanks , I like it too . I bought it at the nearby department store .
__label__surprise	Really ? That's a straws in the wind .
__label__joy	Nice to see you again .
__label__joy	Oh , yes , I'd very much like to go .
__label__joy	Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink .
__label__sadness	it was horrible ! It was just one thing after another .
__label__joy	You speak good English , though .
__label__sadness	I am really exhausted , you know , I have been working without the weekend for two weeks . My boss always asks us to work overtime .
__label__sadness	Unfortunately , you will not be able to view it today .
__label__joy	My birthday present ? I can't help telling you that I am a happy woman , darling . I will come back soon . ( Go to her bedroom and wear the new dress , then show it to Steven . )
__label__joy	Thanks for encouraging me . There are problems cropping up here and there . But I will overcome them one by one .
__label__joy	Why are you doggy-paddling ? I taught you how to swim ! Do your breast stroke !
__label__joy	Well , that's nice I guess . So how many kids do you have ?
__label__joy	Sure , but the work you did was really exceptional ! You definitely deserved it !
__label__joy	Oh , no . That ’ s it . Nice to chat with you . Have a good day .
__label__joy	The main product of Chende is various kinds of ferine mushroom and the almond . The mushroom tastes really good , and it is very different from the common mushrooms , and the snack made of almond is delicious .
__label__joy	My wife gave birth to our first child today .
__label__joy	Wow . It is good . Did you make that also ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__anger	What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck !
__label__surprise	Oh dear ! What did he tell you to do ?
__label__joy	Great ! When do you take over ?
__label__joy	Sounds dangerous .
__label__joy	( When they are dancing ) You dance gracefully !
__label__joy	That's convenient .
__label__joy	Great . I'll see you at 6 . Do you know where it is ?
__label__joy	OK . I'll have a try .
__label__joy	Please . Thank you so much for stopping .
__label__joy	Oh , that sounds great . I'll take it .
__label__joy	Hey , Jeanine , get a load of that . It's beautiful .
__label__joy	Absolutely . That's why when he entered the finale , I was so excited .
__label__joy	Thanks very much .
__label__anger	The heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer !
__label__joy	That ’ s a good idea . I ’ ll look into finding something like that .
__label__joy	That's what friends are for .
__label__surprise	Dying can be very expensive nowadays ! What ’ s he going to do with it ?
__label__joy	Welcome to China , Paula .
__label__surprise	Really ? What about the pay rate ? Are the wages pretty high ?
__label__surprise	How can it be cliche ? It ’ s a fable ! It ’ s telling a time-honoured story ! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption , and teaches children the value of respect , life and love .
__label__joy	Thanks , Jeanine , you are a real pal . Let's go in .
__label__joy	Thank you.But I will call her later .
__label__joy	Come and see me again in a month's time . I think you'll be a different man !
__label__sadness	I have asked for a talk again , but she refused and said she wanted to be quiet .
__label__joy	Thank you for all your help .
__label__joy	Ahh ... What a fine day ! I do feel like an outdoor exercise .
__label__joy	It has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park .
__label__joy	You're welcome . Happy couples need mutual understanding .
__label__joy	Me too . I want to know more about you , eg , what's your real name and what do you look like ...
__label__joy	Well , the life style is much more relaxed than here in the city . And the seafood is tastier !
__label__joy	No , just come here .
__label__joy	Goodbye . Thank you again for coming .
__label__joy	Let's say about 6:00 ?
__label__joy	The master suite is the best . Let ’ s go look at that next .
__label__surprise	Really ? That ’ s very good of you , Helen . But I must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing .
__label__disgust	Oh , don't mention it . It was terrible .
__label__joy	You will feel comfortable paying the money .
__label__joy	Good . See you !
__label__joy	That's a good reason to like something .
__label__joy	Okay . Good night . Have a good dream .
__label__joy	Certainly .
__label__joy	Sounds interesting .
__label__joy	Oh , that's good ! He sounds like a good teacher .
__label__joy	I think you'll love this pan . Do you want to pay with cash ?
__label__joy	Do you have any where in mind ?
__label__surprise	Really ? How can he be so sure about the timing ?
__label__joy	I like the kid . He's so lovely .
__label__joy	Congratulations ! Susan . I ’ m so happy for you .
__label__joy	Pure gold ones , please . This is so beautiful . I'll take it .
__label__joy	Okay .
__label__joy	I think that's what I want . How much is it ?
__label__joy	Thank you . How much will this cost ?
__label__sadness	I had a bad start of the day . I was stuck in a bad traffic jam on my way and I missed my morning meeting .
__label__joy	Mr.Martin , we're on arrival .
__label__joy	It's reasonable . Here you are .
__label__joy	This apartment is wonderful .
__label__joy	Yeah . Let's plan something tomorrow .
__label__joy	Okay .
__label__joy	That was quick work . Let me have a look at it . Yeah , everything looks fine now . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Fine . It will be at my house . Do you know how to get there ?
__label__joy	Take care , and give my best to your parents .
__label__sadness	Wait a minute , please---Mr . Wong , I'm terribly sorry . Our delivery truck had an accident today . I'm afraid your sofa won't be delivered until tomorrow .
__label__joy	I think a mountain village is splendid !
__label__joy	Thanks for reminding me .
__label__joy	OK . Where ?
__label__anger	They arrested me for nothing .
__label__joy	Let's go and try now !
__label__joy	Never mind . I'll be waiting for you .
__label__joy	The night is young , folks . Get some food and mingle with those faces from yesterday .
__label__anger	Why don ’ t you help me save money ? You are always spending money .
__label__joy	I think I will . Thanks for the info .

__label__disgust	I wasn't happy with it .
__label__anger	I really do hate public transportation .

__label__joy	I went bungee jumping yesterday . It was so exciting .
__label__joy	Thanks for everything .
__label__surprise	What ! That sounds perfectly ridiculous ! Labour Day is a holiday for everyone , not just laboring staff ... and we get a whole day off tomorrow anyway , so what's the point of an extra hour tonight ?

__label__joy	My wife and I will look forward to it .
__label__surprise	My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ?

__label__joy	What style do you want ?
__label__anger	This is highway robbery . I've got a good mind to call the police !
__label__surprise	Are you ? Who's the lucky girl ?
__label__joy	Hey , honey I ’ m back . Wow , the house looks really good !
__label__joy	I lost track of time .

__label__joy	Not at all .
__label__anger	You can ’ t just throw me out on the street !
__label__anger	Like me ? But you see I am so successful now . And if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future .
__label__surprise	Oh ! How could I forget such an important holiday ?

__label__joy	They give me a lot of congratulations .
__label__joy	You think it looks nice ?
__label__joy	Spring will come soon . And we will have some pleasant weather then .
__label__sadness	I really can't work overtime . Because my husband has been ill recently , I must take care of him .
__label__anger	That's crossing the line .
__label__joy	it's about 200 years old . It has a lot of history !
__label__joy	Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does .
__label__anger	You can ’ t take me to jail ! What about my sleigh ? It ’ s Christmas Eve ! I have presents to deliver ! Rudolph ! Prancer ! Dancer ! Get help !

__label__joy	Thanks , Frank . I ’ d love to come . When is it ?
__label__joy	See you later .
__label__joy	Well , I don't know about the profit part yet . But I am really having fun !
__label__joy	They fit me very well . I like them .
__label__fear	I'll see you at the airport at 12 thirty P . m .
__label__joy	Hello , thanks for calling 123 Tech Help , I ’ m Todd . How can I help you ?
__label__joy	He ’ s fine , Thanks . How ’ s Emma ?
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__joy	Yeah . Let's just lounge around !
__label__anger	I ’ m itching for moving !
__label__joy	It worked out well that the wine that I brought to share seems to blend well with this meal .
__label__joy	That sounds really good .
__label__joy	How about eight o'clock tomorrow morning ?
__label__anger	My stomach's growling again !
__label__joy	Thanks . But it ’ s necessary for me to buy a TV set .
__label__anger	You think so ? Oh , no ! How can he do this to me ? I ’ m sure he ’ s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn ’ t he call ?
__label__joy	Well . What time would you like me to pick you up ?
__label__joy	Say when .
__label__fear	I'm really in a flap about the interview .
__label__joy	I suppose I do .
__label__surprise	It sounds amazing to me .
__label__joy	that ’ s a good idea . Do you know anyone who has done that before ?
__label__joy	great . Bye .
__label__joy	April 2nd . I missed being a target of a lot of jokes by one day . I guess I am lucky , too !
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Well , let me know when you can get it fixed . I ’ d love to go for a ride in it !
__label__joy	that's a good idea . Let's discuss after work .
__label__joy	I hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas .
__label__joy	You have nothing to worry about with her .
__label__joy	Come here ! I can see the tall camphor trees from here .
__label__joy	I suppose so . It's great .
__label__joy	Yeah , why not ? I've got a little free time on my hands . Where do you want to eat ?
__label__joy	I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way .
__label__surprise	You didn't know ?
__label__surprise	Really ? What a shame ! I thought she was going to win this one .
__label__joy	No . I'll try them . Sounds good .
__label__disgust	Oh , how awful . What a terrible thing to do .
__label__joy	Well , he's very tall and handsome .
__label__surprise	$ 500per light ? ! That's ridiculous ! It can't possibly be that expansive !
__label__joy	Let's eat at the restaurant across the street from my apartment .
__label__surprise	You mean I could finish this course and still not know English ? You ’ Ve got to be kidding !
__label__joy	Yeah , seems that you have a lot to learn and memorize .
__label__disgust	It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture .
__label__disgust	That's true . Her husband is a fat cat .
__label__surprise	Really ? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . What did you think of it ?
__label__joy	Sounds nice .
__label__joy	Have a good day . Bye-Bye !
__label__joy	Thank you very much ! And then what ?
__label__joy	Well Allen is a great student . He is a hard worker and very well behaved , however he does struggle a bit with math .
__label__joy	That's not a problem . I'll pop in later today to make a formal request . Thanks !
__label__joy	That ’ s a good idea . You ’ Ve got a nasty bruise on your hand .
__label__joy	Thanks . If I am interested , I'll go to the library .
__label__joy	quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark
__label__joy	That's good .
__label__joy	Oh , I see it . Thanks for your help .
__label__joy	Thank goodness we're not rich and famous !
__label__joy	I like your new skirt .
__label__joy	Give me your email , would you ?
__label__anger	Silly boy ! The dustbin is at the back of the school . Now pick up the paperand put it in the dustbiri .
__label__anger	I'm most grateful . Everyone in our class enjoyed it .
__label__joy	He had great vision , didn't he ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	What an idea !
__label__sadness	I'm sorry . Our company has just opened . There are always too many things to handle . You know that .
__label__joy	Great ! Good luck .
__label__joy	It's super .
__label__joy	I think so . Yes , they get along so well .
__label__anger	Absolutely not ! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday !
__label__joy	The pleasure is mine.Happy birthday and many happy returns of the day !
__label__joy	I can ’ t wait to start cooking . I ’ Ve bought the grill and charcoal.Do you have enough plates and utensils ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much.By the way , is the hospital beside the bookshop .
__label__joy	And they're very dear , too .
__label__joy	Yes . I did .
__label__joy	That will be my pleasure .
__label__joy	Yikes ! Thanks for your interest in this job . We ’ ll be getting back to you .
__label__joy	All right .
__label__joy	Don't you think these festivals are more interesting !
__label__sadness	It ’ s unfair .
__label__joy	It ’ s ok . I ’ ll call her back latter . Thank you .
__label__surprise	really ? I'll take it , and I'm leaving here tomorrow . Is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you gte it in ?
__label__joy	Cool !
__label__joy	Thank you . Bye .
__label__joy	That sounds refreshing . Thanks !
__label__sadness	Oh dear , I forgot to bring it .
__label__joy	Bottom's up , and you're right . This meal is incredible . I wish I had known this restaurant before . Thanks for bringing me here . I know I'll be back soon .
__label__sadness	As a matter of fact , I am a bit upset . I just came out of a meeting and it didn't go very well .
__label__joy	You ’ re right . I usually end up staring at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class .
__label__anger	Egg ! I told you about it last week ! Smelly Toes is playing , and Eric asked if I would go with him !
__label__joy	Thank you so much . I really appreciate that .
__label__anger	Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded .
__label__joy	That ’ s great . If you don ’ t mind my asking , does your company give bonuses ?
__label__joy	Of course . The fitting room is this way , please .
__label__joy	I'll tell you all about it next Monday .
__label__joy	I've been accepted by the university , and they've offered me a position on the basketball team !
__label__anger	You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
__label__joy	Well , I hope the client feels the same way !
__label__surprise	Really ? It is amazing . I will apply for a position in your company .
__label__joy	Of course . It's the best one I have here---and it's only 300 yuan .
__label__joy	Ok , let's go then !
__label__joy	That ’ s a good idea . Remember that if the parents watch too much Tv , the kids will probably follow suit .
__label__sadness	Poor me !
__label__sadness	Not a great week for the world ! Any good news ?
__label__joy	Oh ! You took the guesswork right out of that one .
__label__joy	Thank you very much , ma'am , but we don't take tips in China .
__label__surprise	Really ? That ’ s marvelous !
__label__joy	It sounds good . I'll take that .
__label__joy	I'm here to express my congratulations to you on your birthday . And I wish you many happy returns of the day . Here is a birthday present for you .
__label__joy	Terrific ! Then how should I apply for ?
__label__joy	Oh , yes . I should be there some time next spring .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it .
__label__joy	Wow ! I can't believe I'm standing here !
__label__joy	Wonderful ! I'll often come here for mountain climbing .
__label__joy	Very well sir . Would you like to have some shirts made also ?
__label__joy	Honey , I'm sorry . I promise you , this summer vacation , I will take you to Huang-Shan Mountains . It is more beautiful and magnificent .
__label__joy	Yeah , just return to nature and feel the thrills of its beauty .
__label__joy	I see . It feels very light on the skin .
__label__sadness	Oh no . I broke your vase accidentally .
__label__sadness	Oh , no ! What should I do now ?
__label__sadness	Oh dear , that sounds terrible .
__label__joy	To show our appreciation for your hard work , we'd like to invite you to have dinner with us .
__label__joy	Whoa ! This is a massive flea market !
__label__joy	Thanks !
__label__joy	Look ! The girl is so beautiful and she is smiling at me . She is lovely .
__label__joy	Very well , thanks . Nice to see you again . I haven't seen you for a long time . What have you been doing lately ?
__label__sadness	I have done a lot of reading comprehension exercises , and I also spend much time in memorizing English words .
__label__joy	Thank you . I just bought these new shoes earlier today .
__label__anger	you said it . Good beer , good music , and on top of that , there are so many hot girls here !
__label__joy	Looks good ! I ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
__label__joy	OK . I'll be back soon .
__label__joy	Polarizing filter um we should ! I ’ m sorry , ma ’ am . It looks like we ’ re sold out .
__label__joy	You too !
__label__anger	What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck !
__label__joy	That's rock and roll with fast tempo .
__label__joy	Well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ?
__label__joy	I'd love to . I heard about Halloween when I was in Beijing . It's kind of a children's day . Small kids get dressed up , then walk around with paper bags or baskets , knocking on the neighbor's
__label__joy	She feels you gave me the freedom to be able to assist her and she appreciates that . Come on , Let's indulge her .
__label__joy	Yes , it's really savory .
__label__joy	Cheers ! To our first night in our new apartment .
__label__joy	You did a fabulous job .
__label__joy	Great . Thank you .
__label__anger	I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !
__label__joy	Here is a gift for you . I hope you like it .
__label__anger	Why didn't you just call ? I hate sending SMS messages .
__label__joy	Happy Birthday ! This is for you , Kate !
__label__surprise	My goodness ! You ’ re kidding !
__label__joy	Here comes the last course ! Shall I help you to the dish ?
__label__joy	Well , I was walking down Nan Jing Dong Lu ( Nan-Jing E . Rd . ) during my lunch break thinking about this boy-I have no idea why I was thinking about him .
__label__joy	Just make yourself at home . The other guests should be arriving shortly .
__label__joy	Yes , I'm a very good mother and successful career woman .
__label__joy	Sure . Here you are .
__label__joy	Hah , as the sale department director of our team , you are the best .
__label__joy	That's a good idea . Do I need to bring anything myself ?
__label__surprise	Really ? When did that happen ?
__label__joy	Good.Red suits me very well.It ' s a cheerful color , isn't it ?
__label__sadness	I ’ m sorry , but you won ’ t be able to view it today .
__label__surprise	Really ? Why not ? I hear it ’ s pretty good .
__label__joy	I couldn't agree with you more .
__label__surprise	Kreng ? I've never heard of that company .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , but I really need it this afternoon .
__label__surprise	No way ! That's great ! Then we'll still be together !
__label__surprise	You honestly have no idea ?
__label__surprise	Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ?
__label__joy	Not bad , thanks for asking .
__label__joy	Help yourself .
__label__joy	Would you like to stretch your legs ?
__label__anger	I was robbed .
__label__joy	That is great . Everyone says French food is wonderful .
__label__joy	Thank you !
__label__joy	Thanks . I am feeling pretty good about myself too . You know , bigger office , a raise and even an assistant .
__label__joy	Of course . I made the apple pie this morning , so it ’ s lovely and fresh .
__label__joy	That will be fine . We ’ ll have your meals ready when you arrive . Thank you for your order .
__label__joy	Good idea !
__label__anger	No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home !
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	OK . I will be free at tomorrow afternoon . I'll take a taxi to get there .
__label__joy	Thank you , Linda . We would love you to come to our wedding .
__label__surprise	Mud ? But Ivan told me there were no mudslides in that district . I thought all the mudslides were down in Chichitango .
__label__joy	Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution .
__label__joy	With the greatest pleasure.Where is the concert this evening ?
__label__joy	We are fishing with worms . The fish seem to like them .
__label__joy	Very good , sir . Your order will be ready in one week .
__label__fear	No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood .
__label__joy	Here is a present for you . I hope you like it .
__label__joy	Thanks for everything .
__label__surprise	What ! That wasn't a foul ! C ’ mon , ref !
__label__joy	Good .
__label__joy	No problem , just go ask .
__label__joy	Ok , thank you .
__label__sadness	I don't know . I failed my exam .
__label__joy	Fine , thank you , sir . It ’ s nice to see you again .
__label__joy	Beautifully done , many thanks .
__label__joy	Yes , I'm glad I have come .
__label__joy	Ok by me .
__label__joy	Oh , good.That ' ll be the number forty four ?
__label__joy	Wake up sleepyhead.The sun is beginning to shine . What a lovely summer day !
__label__joy	You are welcome . Have a safe trip .
__label__joy	thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Nothing , son . I'm already very happy .
__label__joy	With pleasure .
__label__joy	Thank you for all the help .
__label__surprise	We have an appointment in half an hour .
__label__anger	I have no idea what you are talking about . I just want to know if it ’ s good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
__label__joy	Do you want to go to the beach tonight ?
__label__disgust	Actually , I had a perfect plan for this afternoon , but it is totally ruined by the sand storm . I woke up this morning and found it was sunny . So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . We were going to look for a new purse . Now it turned out to be like this . Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	I wonder if you can cook things this good .
__label__joy	Yes . How about you ?
__label__surprise	Really ? Are you sure ?
__label__surprise	Oh , no ! How did this happen . Are you sure ?
__label__joy	See you around !
__label__joy	He has big blue eyes and long blonde hair .
__label__joy	How about seven ?
__label__joy	Why don't we go to a concert instead ?
__label__disgust	I'm fed up with his boring lectures .
__label__joy	Here's some dancing . See those guys stomping , clapping and shouting ? They're practicing step-dancing .
__label__joy	That sounds really good to me right now .
__label__joy	Congratulations ! This is your first interview ever .
__label__anger	Come on ! In the two hours we've been here , you haven't sung even one song !
__label__surprise	I can't believe that .
__label__joy	Good morning , Miss Bell !
__label__joy	Try not to take on more than you can handle .
__label__joy	Oh , I see . You're going to wear one and pretend you're married to try to attract guys .
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__joy	Thanks . It's a little tight . Do you have any in a larger size ?
__label__joy	It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
__label__joy	That's smart these days with all the news on skin cancer . Hey , there's everybody ! We made it !
__label__sadness	Oh !
__label__anger	The door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart !
__label__joy	Don't mention it .
__label__joy	By all means .
__label__joy	Do you prefer brandy or ports .
__label__joy	Well , the scene of the hero's struggle with enemies impressed me the most .
__label__joy	The pleasure is mine . It's been nice talking with you . Goodbye .
__label__sadness	Sorry , I overslept . My clock didn't go off this morning .
__label__joy	Thank you . Nice to meet you too . I'm John . Is this your first time to take a long-distance trip on plane .
__label__anger	Certainly not .
__label__joy	What a heavy snow ! Look ! The water is frozen .
__label__joy	Of course ! I'm not only going to wear red underwear , but I'm going to wear red socks and a red shirt , too !
__label__joy	Lucky her . Anyway , I think that is just as beautiful .
__label__joy	Have a nice holiday !
__label__joy	That's great . We can also take the dragon kite with us . After the picnic , we can fly it .
__label__joy	That's good . Do you live near here ?
__label__disgust	I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me .
__label__joy	Good job ! This is going to be a great night !
__label__sadness	I am sorry to say this but I seem to have lost the key to the safe .
__label__joy	Is this Zhang Lin's home ?
__label__joy	That sounds good . I'm going to order the same thing .
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__joy	Yes , I know . He's really on the A-list .
__label__joy	I'm pretty good .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	He must be all over you the first time he saw you .
__label__anger	I am very grateful for your advice .
__label__joy	Congratulations , I hope everything works out .
__label__surprise	How could you not notice it ?
__label__joy	That's great .
__label__joy	OK .
__label__joy	Sounds good , let me get that .
__label__joy	It couldn't be better . My husband is so supportive with my work and he helps around the house so much .
__label__joy	I'm so honored that you thought to ask me .
__label__joy	Yes , it's so exciting , though I had the most falls in our skiing team .
__label__joy	Yes , certainly.Would you wait for a few minutes ?
__label__disgust	Well.John had promised to be my date , but he stood me up . I waited for a full hour in the cold wind .
__label__joy	Yeah , I know .
__label__joy	There's no secret at all . The only thing for you to do is to practice more . You will succeed .
__label__joy	The apple crisp sounds great .
__label__joy	I also feel that work efficiency here is very high . and you have strong working ability and professional skill , it seems that you know all , that's really wonderful !
__label__joy	Pretty good . I've just bought a new house .
__label__joy	Thank you for your understanding sir . I will book your flight now .
__label__joy	Don ’ t worry , I will teach you how to win .
__label__surprise	Oh , dear . What was in it ?
__label__joy	Then he sent you to your home ?
__label__joy	What a find ! So , how much does it cost ?
__label__joy	Yeah , and most excitingly , I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice .
__label__joy	Oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ?
__label__joy	All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ’ s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole !
__label__anger	That may be , but you're still under arrest . And you'd better stop talking .
__label__anger	There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick .
__label__joy	You're right--Italian ! Ha ! Ha ! I was trying to trick you , but you didn't fall for it !
__label__joy	See you on Thursday , then .
__label__surprise	Oh , dear !
__label__joy	That's nice .
__label__joy	Thank you . I'm going to bed .
__label__joy	Thank you for the information .
__label__joy	Don't worry . Everything will be fine .
__label__joy	I sure will .
__label__joy	What does this mean ?
__label__sadness	Www , man !
__label__joy	That ’ s a lovely hat .
__label__joy	That sounds great . I'll bring a bottle of wine then .
__label__anger	Oh , come on , Ultraman !
__label__joy	Goodbye .
__label__joy	I can't help shopping there .
__label__surprise	You mean I'm among the people who have to go ?
__label__joy	I'd love to .
__label__joy	Morning .
__label__anger	We hope that there will be no repetition of this kind of trouble in the future .
__label__disgust	I'm sick of it , too .
__label__joy	No , I shouldn't think so.By the way , is there a socket for my razor ?
__label__joy	Can you take part in our picnic this Saturday ?
__label__joy	Merry Christmas , Mr . Wang . I would like to give you the book I specially chose as my appreciation for your sincere help to me in the past few days .
__label__joy	They look really good on you . They look comfortable too .
__label__joy	I like it .
__label__joy	This is just right for me . I'll take this one .
__label__joy	That's a long time ! Was the weather OK ?
__label__joy	Hey , sounds great to me , kid . What kind of job did you find ?
__label__surprise	Oh , Yes ?
__label__joy	Thank you for letting me borrow your portable CD player .
__label__joy	Just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset .
__label__joy	Well , off we go . I am sure we can have a great time .
__label__joy	I am so glad that you decided to stop by !
__label__joy	I'm sure I'll enjoy seeing them.and will have more information of your city industry.what is more ? I'd like to visit if it is possible.the famous Goumi street in the city .
__label__surprise	Really ? That ’ s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ?
__label__sadness	That's not fair . We had fun . Give me a second chance . Can we meet tomorrow night for drinks at the pub ?
__label__joy	Yes , I'll be waiting for you in my home by 10:00 .
__label__joy	You are welcome . Goodbye .
__label__joy	It's just what I wanted .
__label__surprise	Wear red underwear ? ! Does that really work ? Are you going to try it ?
__label__joy	I've heard of that one . It was also his swan song .
__label__disgust	It sure would . Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? She had horrible posture !
__label__joy	My mascara's waterproof !
__label__joy	Good boy . I can only imagine how happy she will be to see you .
__label__joy	Sounds great
__label__anger	No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband .
__label__joy	I want to tell you that I like you
__label__joy	Cindy , you're so cute .
__label__joy	Who wouldn't ? Wow , that's out of this world .
__label__anger	Come on ! I'll pay you back on Tuesday .
__label__joy	I like the feeling then that school is almost over !
__label__joy	I want to be healthier this year , so I think I should take more exercise .
__label__sadness	Oh , my God ! What do I do now ? Bone head .
__label__joy	You're welcome , Goodbye !
__label__joy	I see . All right , well I think everything else I can figure out on my own . The deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( K ) are pretty self-explanatory . Thanks for your help , Susan .
__label__sadness	How awful ! Was he hurt ?
__label__sadness	I'm terrible sorry . I seem to have mislaid your MP4 .
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__joy	Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?
__label__joy	Sure . Come on it . We just finished rebuilding everything .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Sounds like you'll be able to help me a lot .
__label__joy	Happy birthday ! Many happy returns ( of the day ) .
__label__surprise	How on earth can you miss several buses ?
__label__joy	Ok , that would be great .
__label__joy	Such an eye ! The true hazel eye-and so brilliant ! Regular features , open countenance , with a complexion , Oh ! What a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ' the picture of health ' ; now , she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health . She is loveliness itself .
__label__sadness	Rather . I'm afraid I didn't do very well .
__label__anger	Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me , miss , how much will I have to pay for all of this .
__label__joy	OK , will do !
__label__surprise	Oops !
__label__anger	Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant .
__label__joy	Thank you for joining the library ; we look forward to serving you .
__label__joy	Mum , I have something for you today .
__label__surprise	Why is that ?
__label__joy	This is wonderful . Thank you for doing all this for me , Miss Lee .
__label__joy	Have a good time . Next time you're free , give me a call and we'll go play poker .
__label__joy	Thank you . You ' Ve been very helpful .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	We're going dancing tonight .
__label__joy	That's great . Thank you very much .
__label__sadness	After this lunch , I haven ’ t got much green left .
__label__surprise	What ? What did you buy ?
__label__joy	Thank you !
__label__joy	Don't mention it . Just a little thing I did .
__label__sadness	You know ... I did very poorly on that test .
__label__joy	Thank you . I'll work hard .
__label__joy	That ’ s great .
__label__joy	Well , then , may I invite you for the first dance ?
__label__anger	What kind of warrant ?
__label__anger	It's the holidays ! Everybody knows how hard it is to get tickets !
__label__joy	Yes . It was a friend ’ s birthday party . We drank all kinds of things-beer , wine and spirits . After midnight , we were even drinking cocktails !
__label__joy	Let ’ s do it !
__label__joy	Yes , I did .
__label__joy	I ’ m glad you understand .
__label__joy	Good idea . Have you written down tea , eggs and potatoes ?
__label__joy	Not at all .
__label__surprise	Is she ? I thought she was a mathematician .
__label__joy	Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	I loved it , too . To tell you the truth , I even dropped tears .
__label__joy	Uh , just for fun . Happy Easter , Mom . We got you these Easter lilies .
__label__joy	No , thank you .
__label__joy	It has got this year's Oscar Award .
__label__joy	All right . See you tomorrow .
__label__disgust	The mosquitos are biting me !
__label__joy	Fine ! How are you ?
__label__joy	Good morning ! I am a new comer in our office .
__label__joy	Welcome to our university ’ s fifties anniversary , Sir . Please have a seat .
__label__sadness	I see what you mean , but I ’ m still bummed out .
__label__joy	See you tomorrow .
__label__surprise	Return on investment ? How can you have a return on this kind of investment ? Can you really calculate the value of these training programs ?
__label__joy	I have some friends who might be able to help you find a job . I'll see what they can do .
__label__joy	OK , that's perfect ! By the way , is there any playground in our neighborhood ?
__label__joy	I am really excited !
__label__joy	I wish I could stay longer , but I must be going .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Congratulations ! It ’ s good to follow your heart . But I just didn ’ t expect to be so fast .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	that would be lovely , thanks .
__label__surprise	A barber shop ? !
__label__anger	I didn't like her butting in where I didn't want her . She's a chatter box .
__label__joy	Of course .
__label__surprise	What ? You call that a stir fry ? More meat than vegetables ? That ’ s the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry . What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in ! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap !
__label__joy	Sure . Let's buy it .
__label__joy	Thanks for the loan .
__label__joy	That is really convenient . Especially now that fuel prices are so high ! What ’ s under the hood ?
__label__joy	I can not agree with you more . And if you are an awful one , that will be funny .
__label__sadness	I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated .
__label__joy	I found a new job after all , and I like this one even better than the last .
__label__joy	I liked talking to you too .
__label__surprise	Really ? Wow , it is great .
__label__joy	Yeah.It is the very latest in digital video cameras .
__label__joy	Just relax . That's because you're new to chat . Let me take a look .
__label__joy	OK , thank you .
__label__joy	Thank you . I appreciate your help .
__label__joy	Sure , that would be great . I'll bring the wine .
__label__joy	Oh . it ‘ s a case flowers . It ’ s very kind of you .
__label__joy	Good idea . That might help .
__label__joy	Thank you for understanding . I promise I'll make it up to you .
__label__joy	I was thinking it could take place sometime in January .
__label__joy	I'll tell you all about it next Monday .
__label__joy	Great . Would you like coffee or tea with that ?
__label__joy	I'm glad to hear it .
__label__surprise	Really ? You don ’ t look very Chinese to me , if you don ’ t mind me saying so .
__label__surprise	Really ? So your city does have some old history after all .
__label__joy	Yeah , it was a lot of fun .
__label__joy	There must be several private companies that are interested in employing someone like you . You could do some research for a university . There ’ s a lot of discussion about genetics nowadays . Someone wit
__label__joy	You look so tan and healthy !
__label__sadness	Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t notice it . Sorry .
__label__joy	Where shall we go now ? A Chinese restaurant or a local one ?
__label__joy	Thanks , Ann . Talk to you this afternoon .
__label__joy	I hope you'll see that we are really doing our utmost .
__label__joy	Ok that sounds good . Where shall I meet you ?
__label__anger	Well , no.it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ?
__label__joy	Thank you . Where should I send your final phone bill ?
__label__joy	You were lucky then .
__label__joy	Oh , that's ideal .
__label__joy	Cool ! Anything else ?
__label__joy	You too , Peter . Give my regards to John . I'll see you in September .
__label__joy	Good luck with that .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__surprise	Really ? It looks so nice .
__label__disgust	I can't see it .
__label__joy	I really enjoy it , especially when it ends up tasting good !
__label__joy	I am ! I've made lots of friends and I really enjoy my courses .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__sadness	Hey , come on . It ’ s too early to say that . We can fix things .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__surprise	You ’ re pulling my leg ! She must be thirty years younger than Leo . Talk about robbing the cradle !
__label__joy	Come to my house this Sunday . My mom will not be at home then . We can cook some wonderful fried food by ourselves !
__label__joy	That's perfect . See you on Saturday .
__label__joy	Oh . I see . Thanks .
__label__joy	Sure , just a minute . Are you an artist , sir ?
__label__joy	I'm really looking forward to reading your column .
__label__joy	Thanks , but tomorrow's payday I can make until then . Thanks any-way .
__label__joy	Oh , thanks , professor Donald.this is very nice of you .
__label__joy	So ... disco is what the music is called and a disco is a place where people go to dance to it.And breakdancing is a different sort of thing altogether .
__label__joy	Wow , that would be something to look forward to .
__label__anger	Is there a reason why you're trying to get off the phone so fast ?
__label__joy	That's a good idea . Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Alex . It ’ s Nancy over in Marketing . I ’ Ve got some good news for you .
__label__joy	Sure . Let me just grab my wallet . You certainly do look happy this morning .
__label__joy	Thank you . How much is this kind of chocolate ?
__label__joy	Yes , it is.It ' s wonderful after the downpour .
__label__joy	Welcome to come again .
__label__joy	Well , your time has been well spent !
__label__joy	Thanks very much . I ’ m sure it will sell well . I can ’ t wait to read it . Here ’ s my card . Thank you for you time .
__label__joy	My pleasure Miss . Actually , could you recommend what to eat here ? I've never been here before .
__label__joy	Sure.Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Yeah , sure . Your total is seventy-eight dollars and thirty-three cents . Here is your receipt . Have a nice day .
__label__joy	No , thanks . How much should I pay ?
__label__joy	Yes . I think so . It ’ s not a very expensive apartment . It ’ s in the right area and it has everything that we are looking for . The rooms are quite large too .
__label__joy	Wise decision . You'll find it's totally worth it .
__label__joy	Hang in there . It ’ ll all come together one of these days .
__label__joy	I hear little Bob has recovered .
__label__surprise	Really ? That's great ! I know that your company has a lot of clients in France .
__label__joy	The neighbourhood is nice too . There is a park nearby .
__label__sadness	Yes , I have . But I have to wait .
__label__joy	The film will start at 2
__label__joy	Thank you for your reminding .
__label__joy	Take it easy . The time for slow dance is the middle part of the party .
__label__joy	I'd love to .
__label__disgust	I hate it .
__label__sadness	no , thanks . I'm not in the mood for traveling .
__label__fear	I think someone is stalking me .
__label__surprise	Really ? Why not ? Don ’ t you go up and talk to them ?
__label__joy	Hey ! That food was terrific . I can't eat another bite . Are you sure you don't want another dish ?
__label__joy	What sort of western food do you like best ?
__label__joy	Cool . Thanks .
__label__joy	No , I'll pay . It's my turn anyway . You paid last time .
__label__disgust	I think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He ’ s still a millionaire .
__label__joy	Fine ! I am going to go home and drop off this nightstand , coffee table and love seat while you look for the rest of the things .
__label__anger	Sure . You look like you're all black and blue .
__label__joy	Thank you . Maybe we can sing a song together . Would you like to sing with me ?
__label__joy	I'm glad you're on your ten-year reunion planning committee .
__label__sadness	yes . It seems she can never accept a childless marriage . We had a fight last night .
__label__joy	Okay , now you are a famous star .
__label__joy	All right . Here's your passport . Welcome to Australia .
__label__joy	Wait a minute ! It also says that the Christ Re-deemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders . I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum , stand in the middle like a gladiator !
__label__joy	They pay just enough .
__label__joy	Don't worry . I will try to get a taxi for you . You can take it to the bus station .
__label__joy	Take care , honey . I am always expecting you .
__label__joy	Thanks again . I will start on next Monday . I am sure I will have good performance .
__label__joy	Welcome to our bar !
__label__sadness	It was ! But the worst thing was I tore my best shirt .
__label__joy	Yep ! And take it with me anywhere ! And the music is free !
__label__disgust	It feels like ten degrees below zero at least . I don't mind the cold weather but I do hate it when it gets slippery .
__label__joy	It's great ! Unfortunately , we're going to spend a fortune doing everything up .
__label__joy	How about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym .
__label__anger	It's the new neighbor . I hate her guts .
__label__joy	Yes , I am really excited .
__label__anger	"If I hear "" Love Me Tender "" one more time , I think I'm going to go crazy !"
__label__joy	I've been to Salt Lake City a few times . I really like your city .
__label__joy	They always make the front yards look so great for Open Houses . Let ’ s see what the inside looks like .
__label__joy	I know girls love this kind of car . Look , it's got a sunroof ! Imagine ... a cool , starry night ...
__label__surprise	You haven't ? They have a lot of good stuff .
__label__sadness	I am not in the mood .
__label__joy	Mumm . Those burgers smell great . It's perfect day for a barbecue .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	what a nice garden ! Look at these tulips !
__label__joy	There certainly are a lot . Can you choose a favorite ?
__label__joy	Apple pie is my favorite .
__label__joy	Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow , who wants to find the treasure on the sea ?
__label__joy	Down to his shoulders . It's beautiful , like gold .
__label__joy	Very well , thank you . I ’ m meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at 12:00 , would you care to join us ?
__label__surprise	Oh , dear !
__label__joy	I've got some great news for you !
__label__sadness	Oooo . This sounds serious .
__label__joy	Absolutely.She ' s a teacher of aerobics .
__label__joy	Fine . They look nice . I will take both of them .
__label__joy	Oh ! Ha-ha ! That's not what I mean when I said ' go Dutch ' !
__label__sadness	Sorry , I made a mistake . They're on the right side of the TV .
__label__joy	Hey , look outside ! It's started to drizzle !
__label__joy	Sure . Wait , wait . Does a lid come with this pan ?
__label__joy	Excellent ! That sounds like a plan .
__label__surprise	But nobody uses Macintosh !
__label__joy	Ha ! Ha ! If you don ’ t make an effort now , later on it ’ ll be a lot tougher for you .
__label__sadness	Oh , I ’ m sorry to hear that . I think you ’ d better talk to the police officer walking there .
__label__joy	How about 5:00 PM ?
__label__surprise	Joe ? I don't know what you mean .
__label__surprise	Oh , no !
__label__joy	Wounds good , and I don't have to queue up at the cashier .
__label__sadness	He ’ s got laid off again . I do feel sorry for him .
__label__joy	I've got to commend you ; you really did a good job .
__label__joy	Sure .
__label__sadness	But we just drove across town . Can't we just go in to see him one last ...
__label__joy	Looks pretty good .
__label__joy	No ! I have been expecting this moment for a long time . I mean my answer is ' yes ' .
__label__joy	Oh , me too ! All the family getting together ...
__label__joy	Yes , and there are many houses nearby . I like it that the neighbourhood isn ’ t full of apartment blocks .
__label__joy	Well , we'll certainly miss you here .
__label__joy	Yes , great !
__label__joy	Thank you for the invitation .
__label__surprise	My goodness ! You ’ re kidding !
__label__joy	Mr . Mechanic , I'd like a nice Venezuelan blend this morning .
__label__joy	It's my pleasure . Hope you ’ ll visit Beijing more often .
__label__joy	Have we sold out all the newspapers for today ?
__label__joy	It's our pleasure to have you here . I hope you will have a pleasant stay here .
__label__joy	Goodbye , then . Thanks again for everything .
__label__surprise	Can you believe that Obama was actually elected ?
__label__joy	And Margaret and I can take the dog and go jogging in the park .
__label__sadness	it's my mother . She's sick and needs someone to take care of her . I'm the only one who can do it .
__label__surprise	Come on . Don ’ t cheat on me . It ’ s a long shot .
__label__joy	Great ! Thank you !
__label__sadness	No , I'm afraid we'll have to cancel the order . I'm not sure whether it agrees with me .
__label__anger	Well , they should have called you !
__label__anger	What a terrible house !
__label__surprise	I have to pay 25 cents a day ?
__label__joy	Yes , of course . I'll take it .
__label__disgust	I really dislike reading academic books .
__label__joy	I ’ m so happy for the family ! They must be very relieved and excited about that .
__label__joy	Who were you talking to ?
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? Would you transfer to another company if it is not what you expected ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__surprise	Are you kidding me ? It's going to be up a piece of cake .
__label__joy	Thank you , Paul .
__label__joy	Yes , that's right . If you find this person becomes more and more important to you and you can totally trust her , then you can stay in love .
__label__joy	That's great . Give me the landscape of the Triumphal for the background .
__label__joy	Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it .
__label__anger	What's wrong with heading out with Mark for vacation ?
__label__joy	Perfect . I also wanted to know if there is any call forwarding service ? I am usually out of town and would like my calls to be forwarded to a local number .
__label__joy	Hi ! Is that the new laptop you brought last week ? It looks very nice .
__label__joy	Well , we were only there for three days , so we didn't do too much . We went shopping and went out to dinner a few times . And at night we walked around the city with some friends .
__label__joy	Wow ! That's really great news . How often does the magazine come out ?
__label__joy	I'm having a party tonight at my apartment . You should come .
__label__surprise	Excuse me , what did you say ?
__label__anger	Curse the worst oven in the world .
__label__joy	Don't mention it .
__label__surprise	what happened ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Yeah .
__label__sadness	I'm embarrassed ! I forgot completely about them . I'm terribly sorry .
__label__joy	Yes , I would , thank you .
__label__disgust	She is only after his money .
__label__surprise	Do you really believe in that ? If they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights .
__label__surprise	What ?
__label__joy	Let's go to work . We want to have the tree ready to light up by evening .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	I ’ ll be happy to get him something special , even if it coasts a little extra .
__label__sadness	Yes , sir . I'm really so sorry about that .
__label__joy	Great , so we can afford the new apartment after all !
__label__joy	I think you deserve a promotion .
__label__joy	All right . Thanks for your help .
__label__joy	Now that our bread is ready , let ’ s talk about the ingredients ! Of course , each person ’ s palate is different , but I ’ m going to give you a few tips that you ’ ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich . I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich .
__label__joy	Don ’ t mention it .
__label__sadness	My girlfriend dumped me .
__label__joy	Well , are we going there today ? I want to take shots there .
__label__joy	Great , Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend ?
__label__sadness	Oh , no . That's bad news .
__label__disgust	I don ’ t like your Rose . And I do love Henry . And I ’ m going to marry him .
__label__surprise	Oh really ? It ’ ll be nice and warm there . Have you been there before ?
__label__joy	Yes , that's perfect . I'll take it .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ?
__label__surprise	Oh , no . I forgot to turn the alarm clock on !
__label__joy	Sounds a good weekend . You know it always amazes me that two people as different as you and Jo can become such close friends .
__label__joy	You are welcome . Have a good trip !
__label__disgust	Yes , and the food was horrible !
__label__joy	Hello , welcome to Universal Bank . Please insert your card into the slot .
__label__joy	Good luck with school .
__label__joy	Well , good for you . I hope you can get what you want from the training .
__label__joy	It's my pleasure . Actually , it's really hard to say as individual tastes are different . As for myself , I'd like to recommend gin and tonic .
__label__joy	You are welcome .
__label__joy	You are going to be really jealous when you find out where I ’ m headed for the holidays !
__label__joy	It sure is .
__label__joy	Fine , thank you , and you ?
__label__sadness	I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down .
__label__surprise	Stones ? I know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ?
__label__joy	Forsythia . It's also called winter jasmine which is the symbol of the spring's arrival .
__label__joy	Goodbye .
__label__joy	Let's go to a car dealership . I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
__label__joy	Sure , I ’ d be glad to help you straighten things out . Why don ’ t I stop by at about seven thirty ?
__label__joy	That's very kind of you . Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	No trouble at all . So long .
__label__surprise	I cant't believe it . You've worked here for years .
__label__joy	That ’ s great . I'd love to .
__label__surprise	You are kidding me ? It is against the labor law . They should be aware of their rights .
__label__fear	It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor .
__label__joy	That might be a little too cold for some people .
__label__joy	Quite often . It is very convenient , saving me a lot of time .
__label__joy	Happy New Year , Jim !
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Well ... the beer sounds good !
__label__joy	Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ?
__label__joy	Yes , I think so . The suit matches the trousers .
__label__sadness	But she did and made me disappointed .
__label__sadness	I want to have a car like that . But I am not rich . And I don ’ t have a rich daddy .
__label__joy	OK . I'll wait for you .
__label__sadness	I ’ m sorry She isn ’ t in at the momment.She will come back at half past nineCan I take a message for her ?
__label__surprise	I beg your pardon ? Who ’ s climbing the tree .
__label__joy	Thanks . That ’ s terrific !
__label__joy	Take my word for it .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	That ’ s good . Take good care of yourself .
__label__joy	I am fine . I am going swimming this afternoon . Are you coming with me ?
__label__joy	That's wonderful . I appreciate your efficiency and cooperation .
__label__surprise	Oh , my ! It's really hot . I've never seen such scorching weather in my life .
__label__sadness	My grandmother just passed away .
__label__joy	Right . I enjoy what I'm doing .
__label__joy	Yeah , I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car . It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself .
__label__disgust	No , it hasn't . It's very dirty .
__label__joy	Thanks honey ! You have such great fashion sense . Now , what am I going to do with my hair ?
__label__joy	Great . My face will turn even redder !
__label__joy	Well . Thank you for coming .
__label__surprise	Ten percent ! Now that ’ s hefty !
__label__disgust	Lousy weather , isn't it ?
__label__anger	It's none of your business .
__label__joy	This is a nice set of wheels . How much did the dealer charge you for this ?
__label__joy	So am I going to see you at the party ?
__label__joy	I ’ m sure you ’ ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country .
__label__joy	Thank you , Madam . Have a nice drive !
__label__joy	Yeah , it was nice to meet you . Hope I run into you again sometime .
__label__joy	OK . When ?
__label__joy	I couldn't agree more . Actually , I'm a Beijing Opera fan .
__label__joy	That is a really interesting fact .
__label__joy	Perfect . Thanks !
__label__joy	This is where we sing ? These booths are so comfortable I think I could fall asleep !
__label__sadness	Sorry , mum . I won't do it again .
__label__joy	that smells great . I'll take one bottle , please .
__label__joy	Certainly.Go ahead .
__label__joy	My pleasure .
__label__surprise	Did I really ?
__label__surprise	You're kidding . The story and acting were outstanding .
__label__sadness	No , I didn't . That car was too fast .
__label__joy	I love you , Troy .
__label__joy	It sounds cool . The rhythms look really difficult .
__label__surprise	Really ? What ’ s the catch ?
__label__joy	There are the pymeids . It ’ s easy to see how they got that name ! they don ’ t have smooth sides though .
__label__joy	It's my health-conscious lunch , good for my health and beauty .
__label__sadness	I ' m sorry sir , but we ran out of chicken . May I suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas ? Both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos .
__label__joy	What day is that ?
__label__joy	Any time will suit me .
__label__surprise	What ? You don ’ t know the first thing about gardening !
__label__joy	How about going to the cinema tonight ?
__label__anger	No , the steak was recommended , but it is not very fresh .
__label__joy	Thank you , Steven . I accept your advice .
__label__joy	Wonderful ! A perfect piece of bread !
__label__joy	Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ’ t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret !
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	It sounds marvelous . Thank you for your help .
__label__sadness	I feel very miserable . I took the death of my wife very hard , you know .
__label__joy	Yes . We're going to be married in my hometown church , the first minute of the new millennium !
__label__joy	exactly .
__label__surprise	You're kidding ! You've always hated cooking !
__label__joy	Are you having a good time ?
__label__joy	That sounds terrific .
__label__anger	That is absolutely incorrect ! I was out on the town Monday night .
__label__surprise	I don't know what to say , Jack !
__label__joy	No , I just started working here at IBM , I am in the sale department .
__label__joy	Of course , yes . They look nice . And they're not expensive .
__label__joy	Thx.Bye for now . Kisssssssssss .
__label__joy	Yeah . The autumn is marvelous here .
__label__joy	You're telling me ! There are thousands of people here .
__label__joy	No kidding ! I'm 16 , too . We should definitely play together some time . My name's Bob .
__label__surprise	Really ? What was the matter ?
__label__joy	Thanks for reminding me . I had forgotten to get mine .
__label__joy	I want to try something exciting .
__label__surprise	A crazy language ? Why do you say that ?
__label__joy	That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play singsong . Perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
__label__anger	No , I didn't . I'm innocent . Those aren't mine . Whatever you found is someone else's stuff . You can't prove anything . I wasn't there when you went in , and you can't prove it's my stuff .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__sadness	Oh , that's too bad .
__label__joy	that is great . Everyone says French food is wonderful .
__label__surprise	Really ? I can't believe it . Everything is possible to a willing heart .
__label__joy	Don't worry . I'm sure you'll do better next time .
__label__joy	We should come here more often .
__label__joy	Oh , that's the very thing I need .
__label__joy	Thank you for your advice . I ’ ll try it .
__label__surprise	Look ! Allen has the mic !
__label__surprise	What ! That wasn't a foul ! C ’ mon , ref !
__label__joy	Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does .
__label__joy	He'll come out with surprises . Just wait and see . Look at that woman , with the white chiffon !
__label__joy	Would you care for a drink ?
__label__joy	Yeah . I was so happy , because my favorite singer , Ricky Martin won ' Best Latin Pop Performance ' .
__label__joy	When are they going to have the party ?
__label__joy	Your wife will be thrilled with the roses .
__label__anger	That ’ s so unfair !
__label__joy	Thank you . That's a good idea . she likes exciting books . Can you suggest another one ?
__label__joy	I hope so . Thanks .
__label__joy	Thank you ... please sign on the line .
__label__anger	I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you .
__label__joy	I'm impressed . Good for you !
__label__sadness	Yesterday . I didn't even know it was coming . He just told me he found someone else .
__label__joy	It seems I find the right place .
__label__joy	Sure , I will . How can I miss that ?
__label__anger	I don't want to .
__label__joy	You can't buy much more , Wei ! You already have enough to fill two boxes to send back to Taiwan .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Thank you SO much .
__label__joy	That is a wonderful choice .
__label__joy	Ok , let's go .
__label__joy	Of course .
__label__sadness	I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down .
__label__joy	Thank you.It ' s very kind of you .
__label__joy	Then I'll take them . How much ?
__label__fear	Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ’ s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot .
__label__surprise	Quit this company ? Oh ... wow .
__label__joy	Good . Red suits me very well . It's a cheerful color , isn't it ?
__label__surprise	What ! Geez ! How could this have happened ? So what ’ s the bad news ?
__label__joy	A chess board ! Daddy is going to teach you how to play !
__label__joy	Right , I'll be right over .
__label__joy	So , can I buy some new shoes as a Christmas present ?
__label__joy	Oh , my family's going to love this one . I'll take it .
__label__joy	That sounds good but I don ’ t know what ’ s on .
__label__joy	I like it very much , but it's a little confusing to me .
__label__joy	Sure . This brand is supposed to be very good , but they're expensive . Those are new products . They come in several colors and sizes . There is also hard , soft , and medium .
__label__joy	I'm glad you like it .
__label__joy	Oh ! I hit it .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry . I thought this was our stop .
__label__sadness	I got fired .
__label__joy	I think we can visit West Lake . The landscapes are attractive . It is said that just as there is paradise in heaven , there are Su Thou and Hang Thou on earth .
__label__joy	Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ?
__label__joy	Yes ... with flying colors !
__label__joy	OK ! Thank you very much . See you a week later .
__label__surprise	are you serious ?
__label__joy	Thank you for coming.Good - bye .
__label__joy	Cool . Thanks . ( Jimmy brings May a glass of orange juice . )
__label__sadness	Yeah . And I never want to go again .
__label__joy	Good idea , Betty . What would you think about the second part ?
__label__joy	Oh , hi ! I'm Barbara Johnson . Nice to meet you .
__label__joy	Thanks ! ... Hello , I have a parcel to deliver .
__label__surprise	What ? No kidding !
__label__joy	Thank you for your understanding , Mr . Tim .
__label__joy	And we'll have a great turkey dinner at around four o'clock . My brother and his family will be joining us . I look forward to meeting them . Well , it's late , so I'll say good night . I'll see you early tomorrow , so I can share your Christmas morning.Good night !
__label__joy	It was a pleasure .
__label__joy	Really , it's so beautiful .
__label__sadness	I should not have listened to you .
__label__joy	Sure . I think you can hear the song everywhere you go now .
__label__joy	thanks for understanding .
__label__joy	Really ?
__label__joy	Yes , wasn't it funny ?
__label__surprise	Really ? How long will your holiday last ?
__label__joy	I do feel like a trip to Florida on such a gloomy day in New York , to enjoy the sunshine while lying on the beaches of Florida .
__label__joy	Thanks . You can also seek job information on the Internet .
__label__joy	I know ! It's gonna be great . But what kind of music do you think we should play ?
__label__surprise	What do you mean ?
__label__joy	Sure . Please come this way .
__label__joy	I love fruit flavored ices the best .
__label__joy	It is the Colorado River . You can go down the river in a boat if you wish .
__label__joy	Yes . I buy a lot of stuff from there . It's a good shop , isn't it ?
__label__joy	That ’ s great . Thanks very much . Would you like a cup of tea or coffee ?
__label__joy	It ’ s just the right size-a perfect fit ! Have you seen anything you like ?
__label__joy	Great ! I'm having a great time .
__label__sadness	Oh , he's 14 and in the past few months , he's become quieter and a bit secretive . He locks himself in his room and I think he's running around with the wrong crowd .
__label__joy	The ice will soon be thick enough for skating . I am so fond of winter sports .
__label__joy	Great ! Wait here ? You don ’ t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! By the way where do you keep them or practice ?
__label__joy	Wow , thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Sure . It's my pleasure . I'd like to help you look for the missing keys .
__label__joy	Yes ! You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol . You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish .
__label__joy	Ok . I'll give it a try .
__label__joy	I think this color isn ’ t quite right for me . Do they have the same dress in white ?
__label__joy	I thought I did bad on the interview , but I guess I was wrong . I'm so happy right now .
__label__joy	No problem . It is always worth trying something new once in your life time .
__label__joy	Oh , did you ? Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	That's nice of you .
__label__joy	That'll be fine . See you soon .
__label__joy	It's my pleasure . Shall we go there on foot ? It's very near .
__label__sadness	I ’ d love to , but you know I ’ Ve got another appointment . I ’ m really sorry .
__label__joy	Goodbye until then . I promise you that you'll do well after we meet .
__label__joy	I am glad you enjoy it . I will tell this to the chef . Would you like some more beer ?
__label__joy	Sure , I'll take mine , sunny side up .
__label__joy	That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you .
__label__joy	This isn't like you ... Well , I hope you will have a nice flight and a successful start in business
__label__joy	You'll see the world-famous magnificent waterfall .
__label__joy	Excellent choice . Can I dish you up some chicken ?
__label__joy	Yes , we've invited four other couples , so it should be a good mix of people .
__label__joy	Mike , these flowers are just gorgeous .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	You're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us .
__label__joy	It is so nice of you .
__label__anger	Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
__label__surprise	Unbelievable ! How do people go through it ?
__label__joy	Sure . So what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ?
__label__joy	This is too good to be true .
__label__joy	Thank you for all of the information . I will help you find the perfect house for you .
__label__surprise	Oh , yeah ?
__label__joy	I love them , too . Let's move into the kitchen . Wait until you see the refrigerator .
__label__joy	A party ? Yes . I'd love to . Thank you for inviting me . Will Monica come ?
__label__surprise	Really ? I can't believe it . It's like a dream come true . I never expected that I would win The Nobel Prize !
__label__joy	Wow . We don't get to see this in the city !
__label__surprise	really ? What do the companies do that for ?
__label__joy	That is great . All I want is for you to do your best in everything you do .
__label__surprise	Really ? I have a weakness for coffee .
__label__joy	Yes , that would be perfect .
__label__joy	Congratulations ! I ’ m really glad to hear it ! That should make balancing the books a lot easier !
__label__joy	Sure . Would you like to have the loaf sliced ?
__label__anger	Dad ! I ’ m gonna catch a cold !
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	What time should I arrive ?
__label__joy	That ’ s great . Is the electrician here today ?
__label__joy	Thanks . Let me see . I think there's a mistake on the bill here . Would you mind checking , please ?
__label__joy	Hey ... as long as I ’ m not alone on a Saturday night , I don ’ t really care what I do !
__label__surprise	Dumplings again ? ! Oh , Amy , let's try something new !
__label__anger	To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate pop .
__label__joy	Great . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	That's great ! I love to dance to fast music .
__label__surprise	really ? Where did you hear that ?
__label__joy	Don't worry , I will come to pick you up at about six thirty .
__label__joy	Thank you . It looks very attractive .
__label__joy	Right . Let's go out and enjoy the beautiful natural scenery .
__label__joy	And the bank will offer you loans for twenty years !
__label__joy	you're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering .
__label__joy	Good , you can make your dream come true here .
__label__joy	That sounds good .
__label__joy	Really , it was nothing .
__label__fear	I ’ m a little nervous . I ’ Ve never flown before .
__label__joy	I always make time for family .
__label__anger	You can't prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people .
__label__joy	( at the dance ) That band is playing good music . Shall we dance ?
__label__joy	I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older .
__label__anger	Fine ! I want a divorce !
__label__joy	That sounds interesting . Okay , I'll get this one . Thanks for all your help .
__label__surprise	Did I ? Well , anyway , you will get your raise when the economy starts picking up .
__label__joy	It ’ s for a job . It looks perfect for you .
__label__joy	There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect .
__label__disgust	It ’ s awful , isn ’ t it ?
__label__joy	The same to you . Keep in touch .
__label__anger	Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true .
__label__joy	Today is my first day at work !
__label__joy	It sounds great , and is it really cool there ?
__label__joy	Now , how about going for a swim in the sea ? We shouldn ’ t sunbathe all day .
__label__joy	Thanks so much ! By the way , is the racket really Serena Williams ’ ?
__label__joy	I can't wait to see it .
__label__joy	Thank you very much . It ’ s very kind of you .
__label__joy	Yes , that ’ s all right . Thank you very much .
__label__anger	Lady ! This is unfair ! I've been cheated ! I was in line before you.That should have been my ticket ! Come on , hand it over , lady !
__label__joy	Thank you for your concern .
__label__joy	Well , I'm glad I made everyone happy .
__label__sadness	That sounds like a nightmare !
__label__joy	That's great . Thank you so much .
__label__joy	Well , I suppose people have different tastes on music . Moreover , here stuff is really strong and creative . It takes time for people to accept new things .
__label__joy	That sounds like a very quick meal .
__label__sadness	We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments .
__label__joy	Good idea . I'll get some , too .
__label__disgust	Yes , it's my steak .
__label__sadness	Yes , sir . I apologize for that . Here ’ s the file you were looking for , Mr . Emory .
__label__joy	A very powerful 2.5- liter turbocharged engine , Trust me , this car is fast !
__label__joy	Thank you for your compliment . But you are exaggerating . I think you are destined to be a singer . You have the best voice !
__label__anger	No way ! I worked very hard so that I could leave on today ’ s flight . Are there seats on another airline ?
__label__joy	Some resolutions ? That's a wonderful idea , but I have no idea yet . How about you ?
__label__anger	Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before .
__label__sadness	No , ma'am . I ’ m afraid you put in only one quarter and one dime .
__label__sadness	I know , I'm sorry .
__label__joy	Thank you . I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet .
__label__joy	"I'm glad you like it.The band is called "" Four and One "" . They are especially good at playing rock and roll ."
__label__sadness	Yes , I can't sleep well every night .
__label__joy	You ’ re great . Could you say it in Chinese ?
__label__joy	You have good taste in music .
__label__joy	Of course I should have ! You certainly deserve them ! You put up with all of us .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Yes , I truly do .
__label__joy	You wouldn't believe what I got in the mail today !
__label__joy	Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun .
__label__joy	Thank you . I wish I would .
__label__joy	Thanks , goodbye .
__label__joy	Yes . See you tomorrow afternoon .
__label__joy	Tom , I won first prize in the poetry contest .
__label__surprise	Really ? You were so happy then .
__label__surprise	You mean I have the job ?
__label__joy	thanks . sorry for making you get out of your seat again .
__label__joy	Sure , I like drinking tea at teahouses .
__label__joy	I am ready I am going to get , let's start !
__label__anger	But I don ’ t like them.It ’ s not fair .
__label__joy	This is my first day at work !
__label__joy	Yes , we do . It is an exciting moment .
__label__joy	Are you almost finished with my hair ?
__label__joy	Fine .
__label__joy	Thank you , I just tried my best . I am very happy to know you like it .
__label__joy	Good morning.So this is the first day for you to work here , I hope you'll like your job .
__label__joy	that looks great . Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
__label__joy	Thanks for being so understanding .
__label__joy	Of course ! I am very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve .
__label__surprise	What do you mean ? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . It ’ s brand new !
__label__joy	That sounds like a good idea . Where should I go to eat that ?
__label__surprise	How could you have the heart to kill it ? We only have one !
__label__joy	Sure . I ’ Ve never seen a dragon boat race .
__label__sadness	Sorry , you have the wrong number . There ’ s no Brian here .
__label__joy	Yes , of course . And what's your plan ?
__label__joy	Thanks for the advice , Mr . Macmillan . I'll keep it in mind . I had better head off though . I ’ m meeting my husband for dinner .
__label__anger	You forgot it last year as well .
__label__joy	Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited .
__label__sadness	Oh , I just can't forget it .
__label__sadness	Then my son drove into a tree
__label__joy	How fun ! Can I bring something ?
__label__surprise	Did you really ?
__label__joy	Hello , Cindy . Congratulations ! I hear you ’ re getting married .
__label__anger	Oh great ! This stupid computer froze again ! That's the third time today ! Hey Samuel , can you come take a look at my PC ? It's acting again . It must have a virus or something .
__label__joy	They're both very well , thanks .
__label__joy	Yeah , I ’ ll try not to ! See you after Christmas .
__label__joy	We can go fishing , chatting and camping .
__label__joy	Oh Jeff ! I love you too ! I ’ m so glad we didn ’ t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle .
__label__joy	Look after yourself . Bye .
__label__joy	Not at all .
__label__joy	OK , I will . Goodbye and remember to look me up if ever you're in Paris .
__label__surprise	Hi , Don . What a surprise !
__label__joy	Yeah , it ’ s been ages ! So how have you been ?
__label__sadness	I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us .
__label__joy	Fine , thanks.And you ?
__label__joy	This city is really comfortable to live in .
__label__joy	That's fine . You will not miss it because it's just next to the Kensington centra Library .
__label__joy	Good . Good luck to you !
__label__anger	That maybe true , and I for one don ’ t want to see anyone lose their job , but how can these Ces ask for a bailout when they ’ re making millions of dollars ? And then , they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets ! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! And they ’ re asking for money ! That is just not right !
__label__joy	That colored one is very beautiful . It may suit my furniture . How much do you ask for it ?
__label__surprise	The Cosby Show ? Wasn't it over many years ago ?
__label__surprise	She ’ s going to live in Paris .
__label__joy	That's great !
__label__joy	We have successfully fulfilled our work plan . In fact , we are No . 1 in terms of market share .
__label__anger	Well , I'm really surprised . You are not doing anything behind my back , are you ?
__label__joy	Sure , I'll go get it for you .
__label__joy	Thank you , but I'm just looking around . How much does this skirt cost ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	That's nice .
__label__joy	OK . Then I'll be expecting you .
__label__joy	Certainly . As you can see , we have several three-piece suites on sale . Feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
__label__sadness	The boss had an informal discussion with me this morning , I feel really down .
__label__joy	Can ’ t be better ! Bob , aren ’ t you glad the semester is over ?
__label__sadness	Oh dear ! What a pity ! Are you sure you lost the wallet in the theatre ?
__label__sadness	I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ?
__label__joy	I'm so jealous of you . I've never been anywhere in Europe . I've always dreamed of traveling around and seeing the sights .
__label__sadness	Sorry , Becky can ’ t come to the phone right now .
__label__joy	I think is looks great . I really like the light colors you have chosen . The pictures are nice too . Did you bought any new furniture ?
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__sadness	Is your turn , Sir . I ‘ m sorry that you have to wait . Saturday is busy day for us .
__label__surprise	That's unbelievable . Why did this happen ?
__label__surprise	What a surprise ! This is the best present I've ever received .
__label__joy	You forgot all of about it , didn't you ?
__label__anger	He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway !
__label__joy	Come on . It ’ s no trouble at all .
__label__joy	In just three weeks , and I am excited . But there are still a few things I need to do before I go .
__label__joy	Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ?
__label__joy	Your daughter is a wonderful student .
__label__anger	Look what you've done !
__label__surprise	oh , really ? so you just took home a stray cat ?
__label__anger	It ’ s an absolute outrage , Sarah , the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers ’ money to the auto industry . These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt .
__label__joy	My pleasure . Good luck to you .
__label__joy	Maybe we should make a plan and list what we should do next , and follow it .
__label__anger	That was my line , Mark . I know we worked on the ad together , but that was definitely my line .
__label__joy	That was easy !
__label__anger	No , we got no receipt , and we pay it on the spot !
__label__joy	Me too . Let's get together and do something .
__label__joy	don't worry . If you don't do well , no one can !
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__surprise	Wow , you sound very professional .
__label__joy	I went sky-diving !
__label__joy	No , it ’ s pretty good . Why not give the landlord a call ?
__label__surprise	Is that right ? I hear all these horror stories of internet business crashing because there is not enough of a customer base yet . How can you be sure your idea will cash in ?
__label__joy	You sound quite knowledgeable .
__label__surprise	No kidding ! Jack is such a log ! He's never dated a girl .
__label__sadness	I had meetings back to back all morning . And phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office .
__label__joy	We are lucky to play in a new stadium .
__label__joy	I'll take it .
__label__joy	That ’ s a good idea . After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear , I can see what new clothes I need to buy .
__label__joy	It sounds interesting . Can I go and see it ?
__label__joy	Thank you for coming so quickly .
__label__joy	It's a pleasure . Come on . I'm on your side .
__label__sadness	I went to the library and lost my bag .
__label__joy	You are right . Anyway , things will be different as the days go on . She can get it . I have faith in her .
__label__joy	It's very kind of you to come and see us off .
__label__joy	what a confidence ! I always watch a lot of movies , too .
__label__joy	OK . Thank you .
__label__joy	That would really help me , Sue . I appreciate it . All this makes me feel like an idiot .
__label__joy	Thank you . I think I have to talk to the bank representatives . Thank you for your help .
__label__surprise	Why am I always the last to know these things ?
__label__disgust	There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired me for sure .
__label__joy	Is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Ok . Got it . Thanks for you help .
__label__joy	It's nice of you to invite us .
__label__joy	Excellent . You can borrow my Janet Jackson's CD . It's her new one .
__label__joy	Oh , I see.Glad to see you here .
__label__surprise	Can you believe that Obama is our new President ?
__label__disgust	I hate school !
__label__joy	I mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
__label__joy	Oh yeah , I remember Jake . That would be fine .
__label__joy	My warmest congratulations on your promotion !
__label__joy	Yes.You look very smart today .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	OK . I know . Thank you .
__label__joy	Goodbye . Hope to see you again next year .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry . I forget all about it .
__label__joy	Let me see . Well , I'd like onion soup . Thank you .
__label__joy	Oh , thanks , professor Donald . This is really very nice of you .
__label__joy	The same to you !
__label__joy	Small world , isn't it ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much , Doctor .
__label__disgust	I think so . Maybe that ’ s why it ’ s cheap here .
__label__joy	Right !
__label__joy	Oh , that all sounds so good ! Can we get the sauce on the side ?
__label__joy	I think you're right . Thank you .
__label__joy	Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection .
__label__joy	Yes , I'm really excited .
__label__joy	I think you can say your seventh great grandfather ! Cutie ! What's his name ?
__label__joy	I appreciate you telling me .
__label__joy	I'm very impressed .
__label__joy	That ’ s good to know .
__label__surprise	What a police officer !
__label__joy	Thanks.This is fun !
__label__joy	I'll take it .
__label__joy	Would you like to have dinner with me ?
__label__joy	Please come again .
__label__surprise	The 1879 Large Dragon ? Are you serious ? How much ?
__label__sadness	That's bad ! I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line has been busy . Will he be back soon ?
__label__disgust	Don ’ t dress like that . You ’ ll make fool yourself . You look stupid in that robe .
__label__joy	Oh , nice to see you . The apartment is on the tenth floor . The previous tenant just moved out yesterday .
__label__anger	Here is the thing . I was woke up by strange noises of the telephone several times last night . Even I unplugged it , it wouldn't stop beeping . I am also not satisfied with the housekeeping service in my room . So I want to change to a cleaner and quieter room .
__label__joy	Why don ’ t you go ahead of me ? I have more items than you .
__label__anger	If you think that she is not fair with your work then you should talk to her in person instead of stewing over it .
__label__joy	Thanks a million .
__label__joy	That's brilliant ! We can name the grades of motor oil by where they come from .
__label__joy	So the weekend is coming ! How about seeing a film !
__label__joy	Who was the conductor at that event ?
__label__joy	A very powerful 2.5- liter turbocharged engine , Trust me , this car is fast !
__label__joy	That's right , mutton chops taste so good , we eat them with sauce , have you ever tried ?
__label__anger	Shut up ! Now you are in my car , you should listen to me . Or you can get off . I've told you I'm in a hurry . I don't want to waste time on the road .
__label__joy	Isn't it lovely ! That's when she got her Master's Degree from Miami University .
__label__joy	You must have enjoyed yourself .
__label__joy	Anna , that outfit looks wonderful on you ! The color goes with your trousers perfectly .
__label__surprise	Really ? I've seen that movie , too .
__label__joy	My pleasure .
__label__joy	Really ? That's the icing on the cake . Congratulation again !
__label__joy	I see.Thank you .
__label__joy	Yeah , I never thought we could be good friends either . We have our differences . She's more outgoing and active while I am more quiet and reversed , but we still get along extremely well . We can talk for hours about anything .
__label__joy	Wow ! Look at all these books ! I bet I can find a book about anything here !
__label__sadness	It ’ s not really an occasion , it ’ s more like I ’ m sorry .
__label__joy	Ok kids , here ’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee , a pail and a shovel . I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . Don ’ t stray too far . Wait ! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes .
__label__joy	Oh , yes . We all sat on the grass , and Margaret played the guitar and sang Greek songs .
__label__joy	Pretty ! Say beautiful rather . Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than she altogether-face and figure ?
__label__surprise	$ 120 ? ! Then I should go and see what I can get ...
__label__surprise	Romantic ? I can't remember what that word means .
__label__joy	Do you smell the sweet scent ?
__label__surprise	Health Monitor ? I read an article about that racket.They ' re overpriced to begin with ! Listen , if I were you , I'd let them take back their monitor and spend my money on something more practical .
__label__anger	They soud like the neighbours from hell !
__label__joy	Yes , certainly.You have the receipt ?
__label__joy	It was exciting !
__label__anger	I ’ m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP !
__label__sadness	It must be dreadful to grow old .
__label__joy	See you around !
__label__sadness	I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city .
__label__joy	Thank you , Mr.Smith . I'm returning to China today .
__label__disgust	So you get drunk every day ?
__label__joy	Of course sir . Our nachos come with melted cheese and chili .
__label__joy	Yeah , it's really convenient . The theater and Shopping Mall are within walking distance . Well , I got to go . I'll get in touch with you soon .
__label__anger	I don't need your help , jerk .
__label__sadness	Any rain right now would be pointless .
__label__disgust	That ’ s stupid .
__label__sadness	I'm afraid I have to return this sweater .
__label__joy	I'm glad we came here . This is really delicious !
__label__joy	Oh , how wonderful . I ’ ll be glad to .
__label__joy	She is a pretty good teacher ! With her help I think I can make great progress in English .
__label__joy	Very beautiful and very interesting . But why do you hang them in the tree ?
__label__joy	Thanks a lot Ayden . Every little bit will help . Tell you what , if you aren't doing anything tonight , why don't you come over and have dinner at my place .
__label__joy	Sure , Mike , I ’ d love to .
__label__surprise	Is that right ?
__label__joy	Thank you for appreciating it .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , but you see , all the tables by the window are small , with up to 4 seats .
__label__joy	Good . See you later .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Yes , my sister loves his personality .
__label__joy	The aquamedic pool is included . You can choose three .
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren .
__label__joy	Mmmm . They smell nice .
__label__surprise	Don't you have one like this in blue ?
__label__joy	Of course . Here you are .
__label__joy	I'll have it if you insist .
__label__sadness	Sorry , Becky can ’ t come to the phone right now .
__label__joy	Yes , I once booked there . They give the immediate confirm information and flight information to both your mobile phone and e-mail . You can conveniently pay by credit card , so the whole transaction only takes a couple of minutes . They also provide e-tickets , meaning you don ’ t need to go to any office to pick an air ticket . You go to the airport directly and check in with your ID card .
__label__joy	You look wonderful .
__label__joy	sounds great ! I'll be there .
__label__surprise	Why ? That ’ s good news , but no one knows it ?
__label__joy	My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink .
__label__joy	OK . How much do you want to bet on this game ?
__label__joy	I'd be glad to . He's really cute .
__label__joy	Thanks . How much would that come to ?
__label__joy	I'm going to the store downtown this afternoon to try on my wedding dresses .
__label__joy	Very well . Thank you .
__label__surprise	It ’ s really unimaginable . The police officer screamed at the driver and used bad language , but the driver took it on the chin .
__label__joy	Jim . I heard you got a promotion !
__label__joy	That is a very quick meal to make .
__label__joy	Great !
__label__anger	Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !
__label__anger	He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .
__label__surprise	Really ? Quite a woman , isn ’ t she ?
__label__joy	I'm in a bit of a hurry today , so we'd better make it to go . Thanks for asking .
__label__joy	Thank you , Mr . Morris . Please wait one moment and let me check on the order . Would you like anything to drink , sir ? On the house .
__label__joy	What are we waiting for ? Let's go !
__label__joy	Hoo , I'm getting tired , Jeanine , been a long day .
__label__joy	That ’ s smart . What do you usually do to relieve your anger ?
__label__joy	Fine , start the car . now gently step on the clutch and shift to 1st gear . Good , now accelerate gently and let go of the clutch as you do it . There we go , good !
__label__joy	You look very professional in the suit .
__label__joy	thank you very much .
__label__joy	Happy Halloween ! What creature are you going to dress up as ?
__label__joy	How nice ! I can see you are busying packing . I'm sorry to interrupt you .
__label__joy	How happy you are ! Next Monday is your wedding day . Congratulations !
__label__anger	Staying out all night , you frightened me to death .
__label__joy	That ’ s without a doubt , the best idea you ’ Ve had ! Let ’ s do it !
__label__joy	OK . It's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh .
__label__surprise	Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling , and an endangered species too . This is lucky !
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	I am very grateful to your help .
__label__joy	That sounds alright .
__label__joy	Ok , great , should I bring anything ?
__label__joy	That sounds like a great price . I'll take one .
__label__joy	I ’ m sure I ’ ll like it here .

__label__joy	sounds fascinating . Where is your new house located ?
__label__joy	Yeah , I've been looking forward to it for ages .
__label__surprise	Wow ! Anything else ?
__label__anger	After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together .
__label__anger	And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ?
__label__joy	Nice and easy . Just give it a little gas .
__label__surprise	Really ? Maybe I ’ ll do that then .
__label__anger	Why ? You can't be always so lazy .
__label__joy	You know , that is one of my favorites !
__label__joy	Very interesting !
__label__joy	Thank you for your warning .
__label__joy	Really ? Let me have a try .
__label__joy	How about playing tennis with me ?
__label__joy	Oh , that's very nice of you . I don't want to sound pushy , but I still l have one more question .
__label__sadness	Better or worse , it doesn't matter . I had a lot of feelings for him . I really liked him
__label__joy	I'll be there . You're still a fabulous cook , aren't you ?
__label__joy	It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things .
__label__joy	What a nice photo you ’ Ve taken !
__label__joy	Thank you , sir . I'll try my best to assist Richard in his work .
__label__joy	Yeuks ! Do they know anything about me ?

__label__joy	No problem , man .
__label__joy	Thank you . I wish I would .
__label__joy	Thank you . I am very happy to have my own office now . I ’ Ve never had one before . It is very nice .
__label__joy	I love this art exhibition !
__label__joy	That was before he heard Stanley sing ! I guess he couldn't stand it anymore , so he decided to give it a try himself ! Allen has a really good voice ! He sounds like Enrique Iglesias !
__label__surprise	Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production ...
__label__disgust	But I don't think much of it .
__label__joy	That sounds like fun .
__label__surprise	Really ? Are you sure ? I called before and he was there .
__label__joy	here you go.On any other day , it would cost me a fortune , but it ’ s on special offer today .
__label__joy	How nice of him !
__label__joy	Those taste really good .
__label__joy	Well , I love it . The room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place !
__label__joy	Wow , that is cheap . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Yes . I like it very much .
__label__joy	London is such a historical city ! There ’ s history everywhere you look . There ’ s nelson ’ s column , built as a monument to one of the Britain ’ s great admirals and his important victory . He won the battle of Trafalgar in 1805 .
__label__disgust	I dislike it most .
__label__joy	I'm glad you're so happy .
__label__joy	Hello there ! Come on in ! Don ’ t just stand there ! Come and take a seat !
__label__joy	Bob , look at this sentence . ' Healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love . ' It's interesting , isn't it ?
__label__joy	It's very thoughtful of you . Wow , it is so beautiful . Could you tell me how American people celebrate Christmas ?
__label__joy	You look great . Your make-up is perfect .
__label__joy	Tom , that lucky guy .
__label__joy	Great . Thanks again . You've been very helpful .
__label__sadness	My parents called . As usual , they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s . Easier said then done . Who should I marry ? I have no time to go on a date .
__label__joy	Cheers !
__label__joy	Well , hope you will enjoy your first day ! Just ask me if you need any help .
__label__sadness	I've finished the first draft , but the professor said it's poorly written . I have to rewrite it . it's so depressing .
__label__joy	In order to extend our export business to your country , we wish to enter into direct business relations with you .
__label__joy	I would like you to meet my family . Can you come to dinner next week at my parents ' place ?

__label__joy	Lamb and beef . It will get even tastier when we add the veggies !
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__sadness	Ohhhh !
__label__joy	Maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better .
__label__joy	Of course .
__label__joy	Yes . I like wearing shorts in summer . My legs would freeze !
__label__joy	You are right . Maybe we should work out a fitness plan and start to do more exercise . Sitting around in the office all day is no way of keeping fit .
__label__joy	OK , I like that place .
__label__joy	Well , it looks very nice .
__label__sadness	No . That price would hardly cover the cost .
__label__sadness	I saw her dating with her ex-boyfriend again .
__label__surprise	That is truly amazing !
__label__joy	No . Just occasionally .
__label__joy	I think you will enjoy your journey .
__label__joy	Hi , Mr . Wang . Do you feel like going boating with me ?
__label__joy	This one is of my wife and me on the beach , and this one is our daughter Emily standing next to my wife .
__label__anger	I don ’ t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ?
__label__joy	You bet it !
__label__joy	Thanks , Tim . Nice meeting you , too .
__label__joy	Thanks , but I have to admit I am really good at bluffing !
__label__joy	Not at all ! I like the design so much . The designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept .
__label__surprise	How amazing !
__label__joy	That's great . I trouble you so much . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	See you .
__label__joy	Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway .
__label__joy	You have good taste . Let my show you what I have .
__label__joy	Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ’ Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ’ s too much information on the net .
__label__surprise	Really ? What's he been doing ?
__label__joy	I love this store . The only problem is that it ’ s extremely expensive .
__label__joy	They are beautiful . You did a good job .
__label__joy	Can I get the black ball in ?
__label__joy	Yes . The scenery there is so breathtaking
__label__sadness	I couldn't . I was bound and gagged .
__label__joy	It's Chinese New Year ! That means it's time to eat hot pot !
__label__joy	Fine , thanks . I've been busy lately .
__label__joy	It's on the 2nd floor . We are going to see some beautiful paintings about the history of ancient Greece .
__label__joy	Good point . I suppose that we all have our own individual styles .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry for that , I'm going to check with the chef right now . Miss , I just checked with the kitchen , and they said your order will be coming right up next . Oh , here comes .
__label__joy	A Chinese girl has broken the world record in the Olympic Games .
__label__anger	I'll never ever work together with him !
__label__anger	But you have had lily already ? You should have told me about her , but you didn't .
__label__joy	Mom , Happy mother's Day ! Here's my card .

__label__joy	Here it is . and thank you very much .
__label__joy	Hah ! OK . Let ’ s go together !
__label__joy	I ’ m sold ! I want to book this trip . I don ’ t care what it costs ! Money is no object !
__label__joy	No , Miss Anna , you must let me say how lovely you are ! What's wrong with that ?
__label__joy	Well , I think it's fabulous . And the neighbors don't even seem to exist .
__label__anger	We ’ re doomed !
__label__joy	You're welcome.Have a nice day .
__label__sadness	Look at me . I look so old ! I look as if I were thirty .

__label__surprise	Didn't I ?
__label__joy	Well . I really do have to go .

__label__joy	Good ! Maybe Malia would like to go in with us on this gift .
__label__anger	The cat has eaten my fish , I'll kill it .
__label__joy	That's a relief .
__label__anger	I see . That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !
__label__surprise	Oh , my god .
__label__joy	It's exciting news ! If we find a second solar system , we might find a second earth !
__label__surprise	Really ? I like playing basketball , too .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__surprise	I can hardly believe it .
__label__joy	I just finished reading this article ' Getting Old Gracefully ' . It's a very good article .
__label__joy	I hear you're entering the speech contest , Mike .
__label__joy	Oh , yes , I am . I have always wanted to go to the States . I love meeting new people . And making new friends .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Well , thank you very much .
__label__anger	What a washing machine ! It ’ s getting worse today . Look ! Now it doesn ’ t work at all . I think I need a new one .
__label__joy	That's a good idea . I think I'll join you .
__label__joy	It's nice meeting you too , Alice .
__label__sadness	Oh yes ! Sorry ! Then we drive to the M11 motorway .
__label__anger	Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen .
__label__joy	Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed .
__label__joy	Yes . What time does it start and do you want to meet me there ?
__label__joy	Let's go !
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Thank you very much . Bye .
__label__sadness	Someone just robbed me .
__label__joy	I think that we could also produce some merchandise for the centenary-you know , T-shirts , mugs , plates , pens , and things like that .
__label__anger	What ’ s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for .
__label__joy	Well , then , may I invite you for the first dance ?

__label__joy	Have fun ! I plan to spend some more time with my grandkids , and I might even go back to school .
__label__joy	Nice meeting you , too .
__label__sadness	I fell on the way to school , and your bike got scratched . I'm really sorry .
__label__anger	But how guilty to waste food !
__label__joy	That's true . I could certainly use the exercise !
__label__sadness	Maybe I just shouldn ’ t show the income then .
__label__sadness	I know , it's not as I had planned .
__label__anger	It ’ s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight .
__label__joy	I look forward to having dinner at your restaurant . Thank you for your help .

__label__sadness	I ’ m afraid not , Bob . One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted , causing major floods and landslides in the region . Meanwhile , Mexico ’ s coast has been hit by hurricane Liliana and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America , affecting Honduras , Guatemala and Panama . That ’ s all the news we have for today , but stay tuned for updates on the six o ’ clock news . Back to you Bob .
__label__joy	Yes , I believe they are . Here are something that might interest you .
__label__joy	Hi ! Tom . Want to go to play bowling tonight ?
__label__anger	They were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and I ’ m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ’ Ve had all day .
__label__joy	So , what was the best thing about your trip ?
__label__joy	Yes , orange juice will be fine for me . But how can you get the drink ? It's so crowded there around the counter . You can barely move .
__label__joy	I'm going to do some shopping . Why don't you come with me ?
__label__surprise	Oh , what exactly is problem ?
__label__joy	Now let's get things ready .
__label__joy	Not at all . We've really enjoyed having you . I hope you'll come and stay again next time you're in Changsha .
__label__joy	That's good . Thank you .
__label__joy	Really ? Let ’ s hit the road .
__label__joy	Hi Bob , this is my friend Mary .
__label__joy	Great ! It's good to see you . Goodbye !
__label__joy	I think that's a great idea . Men look great with that kind of bag.Where can we buy one ?
__label__joy	OK . I know what to do now . Thank you .
__label__joy	Sure . Did you hear anything ? Look ! An eagle is hovering in the sky .
__label__joy	Oh , yes , he is brilliant . What's the name of the young actor ?
__label__surprise	How come ? Last time I saw you . You told me it was a good job , and you'd like to take it as a career . That was only one month ago . Why this sudden change ?
__label__joy	I'll take it . Please set the watch for me .
__label__surprise	You ’ Ve gone through all your money so quickly ? I thought you were well-off .
__label__joy	excellent ! That sounds like a plan .
__label__joy	I see . I'll try .
__label__joy	I ’ m fine , thanks . How is Tony ?
__label__joy	What should I bring ?
__label__joy	We appreciate your business , Ma'am .
__label__joy	Well , surfing , scuba diving ...
__label__surprise	Really ? I will slow down then .
__label__joy	Do you want to try your hand at tennis ?
__label__surprise	It's really a small world , isn't it ! The Hammer family isn't very big .
__label__joy	The view is breath-taking .
__label__joy	OK , Sir . We will arrange it for you .
__label__joy	thanks , sir .
__label__joy	Wow , this new car is dynamite ! It is a shiny , beautiful car .
__label__anger	It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home !
__label__joy	Oh , flowers ! What for , my dear ?
__label__joy	Well , let's finish this great dinner first .
__label__joy	Sure we do ! We have the best tailors in the country ! What is it that you need exactly ?
__label__joy	Nice and warm again , isn ’ t it ?
__label__joy	That ’ s even better than the real thing .
__label__sadness	Sorry . The car breaks down and it needs to be repaired .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	It's really fantastic . The hero , Super Warrior , is so brave that he can defeat any enemies he meets . He runs through tunnels , swims under water , and climbs over bridges . It's really exciting !
__label__joy	Yes , it's my favorite .
__label__surprise	You didn't see it ?
__label__joy	I'm from Chicago .
__label__joy	She's chic , isn't she ?
__label__disgust	I am not interested in trying this restaurant again .
__label__sadness	Doctor , I slipped and fell on my way to school . The ground is so slippery from the snow . It seems I can't move my left arm now .
__label__joy	Okay , but you are going to be my masterpiece !
__label__joy	You often like comparing children with their parents .
__label__surprise	Why ? I work very hard .
__label__joy	Maybe you are right . Please take care of yourself when you make money . Anyway health is the most important thing .
__label__joy	Thank you , sir . Just a moment , please .
__label__joy	Here we are , Ryan ! This is where we're going to celebrate !
__label__joy	She's very funny . She makes me laugh all the time .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course .
__label__joy	Yes , I've been thinking about Florida .
__label__joy	Some friends of my parents live out there , and they invited me there .
__label__joy	Sounds perfect . I can't wait !
__label__joy	Very quiet and safe . And it ’ s got a lot of trees and plants .
__label__joy	Wow , that would be very convenient . How much is the rent ?
__label__surprise	Really ? But it's my favorite .
__label__joy	Oh , Look at the baby.It ' s so beautiful.Is it a boy or a girl ?
__label__joy	Here we are this is my favorite place .
__label__anger	I really don ’ t want to hear your excuses , Janet . We ’ re running a busy office here . You ’ re going to have to keep up .
__label__joy	Borrow morning .
__label__joy	My pleasure , I hope your visit to Beijing is very enjoyable !
__label__joy	Umm . yeah ! Right ! I got the car started ! Thanks for your help ! I told you to fill the tank !
__label__surprise	Wow ! Really ? Are you sure ? Now I'll have a lucky year !
__label__joy	Yes , I would . Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Cool !
__label__joy	Thanks for tucking me , Mom .
__label__joy	May and Daniel often like this kind of weather .
__label__joy	Well , I will text it to you . Thank you , bye for now .
__label__joy	Oh , it's really beautiful , but I just can't dance it well .
__label__joy	The fans are great here , too . Not like in Philadelphia .
__label__joy	You have no idea how happy I am for you .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Good for you . No problem , I'll listen to the car radio
__label__surprise	Really ? I hope I can have a chance to taste it . Don't forget to tell me .
__label__joy	Fine . See you then .
__label__joy	Nice to meet you too ! I am Peter Smith .
__label__surprise	Don ’ t you have air-conditioning in your apartment ? It ’ s sweltering here !
__label__joy	It sounds a good idea . Let ’ s go .
__label__joy	Me , either ! Who decides how much money we get ?
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__sadness	What kind of solution can I have now ? I nearly go crazy now .
__label__surprise	What do you mean ?
__label__joy	Last night
__label__joy	Let's take a coffee break .
__label__joy	What do you say to eating out , Maggie ?
__label__surprise	Pardon ?
__label__joy	Thanks , ma ’ am . You ’ re a lifesaver !
__label__joy	Yes , I am . You must be Tom . Nice to meet you .
__label__joy	It's fantastic !
__label__joy	Thanks very much .
__label__joy	No , thank you .
__label__joy	Of course .
__label__joy	Thank you , Bob ! This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many , a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world . In Switzerland , a major avalanche was reported in the Alps . Fortunately , no one was injured . Due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the US Midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled . Moving to to Latin American , Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming , but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country . In Chile , a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region . Losses are reported to be in the billions . Authorities have not yet released an official statement .
__label__joy	No . The only thing I need to see is your driver's license .
__label__sadness	Today , I am busy all day long .
__label__disgust	I'm afraid I'll feel sick at the sight of it .
__label__surprise	He's dancing with Jack !
__label__surprise	What's wrong with it ? It's filthy !
__label__joy	Not really , but I liked the design , so I got it .
__label__joy	Thank you . Bye-bye !
__label__sadness	I got laid off today .
__label__joy	Yes , we should .
__label__joy	An interesting meeting , isn't it ?
__label__joy	Oh , Miss Anna ! That's too hard ! I won't be here long .
__label__surprise	I can ’ t believe it .
__label__joy	Perfect ! I'll take it !
__label__joy	That's a good idea .
__label__joy	Thank you . I think I like playing it .
__label__joy	Say hi to your parents for me . I hope to see them soon .
__label__joy	There are three of them , the Three Tenors .
__label__joy	Yes . When ?
__label__fear	Is it gonna hurt ?
__label__anger	I know . I still haven ’ t heard from her . The good thing is that I ’ m so angry with her that I don ’ t feel sad about not having her around .
__label__joy	That's a good idea . You are really creative .
__label__joy	Oh , don't mention it . I'm proud of you !
__label__joy	The port is quite exquisite . It must have spent years aging in barrels . Am I right ?
__label__joy	Glad to meet you , Ms.Baker .
__label__joy	Thank you . We'd like to have some dessert .
__label__joy	I am so nervous now . What a terrific game !
__label__joy	Yes , it's perfect !
__label__joy	I hope I can go to your party .
__label__joy	Of course , I will.Well , it's time for me to say goodbye.The plane will take off soon.Hope some day you will come to America for a visit .
__label__joy	Son , it looks great on you .
__label__joy	I like it , too . But sometimes I enjoy jazz and classical music .
__label__joy	I'll wait on the sidewalk . It's very kind of you .
__label__sadness	I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ?
__label__anger	Fine , just get it ! We have been shopping for furniture for five hours ! I ’ m so tired !
__label__joy	Thanks for telling me this .
__label__joy	Then would you like to have lunch with us ?
__label__joy	Thank you . I'd like to get my laundry .
__label__joy	Really ! Here's my trophy .
__label__joy	Thanks for helping me out . I really appreciate it .
__label__joy	Excuse me for taking your time .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry I've already gone through my paycheck for the week .
__label__joy	Here's your receipt . Have a nice day .
__label__joy	Oh , Babe , I can ’ t wait to spend the rest of my life with you ! I can ’ t wait for all the adventures we ’ re going to have , for all the fights and the laughter . I can ’ t wait to grow old and wrinkly with you .
__label__joy	Hobbies are great . I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do .
__label__joy	Fine , honey . Rome couldn't be built with in one day .
__label__joy	Same here ! We will catch up soon , maybe over coffee !
__label__sadness	I won't do it again . Please forgive me .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__sadness	Of course , I should have been more careful . I ’ m sorry .
__label__joy	Could I treat you to dinner tonight ?
__label__joy	Thanks . Let's go driving again tomorrow .
__label__joy	And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does .
__label__joy	That sounds like fun .
__label__joy	That sounds fine . I'll bring in my passport and everything tomorrow . Thanks .
__label__sadness	I know that . You don't have to tell me that . That's my problem . I know I have the right to work for the university . That's legal.But they don't have a job for me . And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere .
__label__joy	Shall we go out tomorrow then ?
__label__joy	Good idea . We should also pedicures and manicures .
__label__joy	You are very lucky to have such a nice family .
__label__joy	She was a very controversial leader . Are we going to visit the famous tower of London later ?
__label__joy	I ’ m glad you are enjoying yourself .
__label__joy	You like it . Well , I'll gather in for you .
__label__surprise	Look at this fair . This is my first chance to be involved in the fair . It is so gorgeous and amazing !
__label__surprise	Thanks , Jane . I was really surprised . I mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
__label__sadness	I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there's something wrong with the fax machine .
__label__joy	Ok , good luck . See you
__label__joy	No , thanks . I'm good .
__label__joy	It's delicious .
__label__joy	I've been good . I'm in school right now .
__label__anger	What do you think I should do about it ?
__label__joy	Yes . It will be fun . Driving back down the coast . My girlfriend will like it .
__label__joy	I'm fond of dancing .
__label__joy	Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings .
__label__joy	Good news . Thanks for getting things done so quickly .
__label__joy	Sounds good , when ?
__label__surprise	You ’ Ve been wasting your time on this ? I can ’ t believe it ! It doesn ’ t even look fun or challenging !
__label__sadness	No , I am single .
__label__joy	What kinds of films do you enjoy ?
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__sadness	Sorry , but I'm not really that interested in those things .
__label__joy	Yeah , too cool . How much did they sold you for ?
__label__sadness	I apologize for that . But the space is too small .
__label__joy	I make each one a little different . It's a way for me to express my creativity !
__label__anger	Just get out of my face !
__label__joy	Yes , and I agree with all his policies .
__label__surprise	Oh , my God !
__label__joy	Please count on my love .
__label__joy	Fine . How is Jim ?
__label__joy	Okay , I'll go take a look . Thank you so much for your help .
__label__surprise	Whew ! I'm impressed ! You really know your stuff !
__label__joy	Did you take any pictures ?
__label__joy	Oh , it's beautiful .
__label__joy	that's terrific . I can't wait to check it out .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	This is the best card I ever received .
__label__joy	That's right.Thank you .
__label__sadness	I've got a terrible pain in my stomach , Doctor .
__label__sadness	Yeah , a number of times .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	You are welcome . Looking forward to seeing you again .
__label__joy	Thank you , Mr . Parker .
__label__joy	Thank you . How much do I owe you ?
__label__joy	Hiking would be perfect ! May I bring along a picnic lunch for us to share ?
__label__joy	Is that so ? Why not ?
__label__joy	Ok , see you .
__label__joy	He's very handsome , isn't he ? What's he like ?
__label__surprise	Oh , no ! I can't have failed . surely ?
__label__joy	Okay . Wait a minute please .
__label__joy	Thank you . I will go get one .
__label__joy	I think you look fantastic . Happy Birthday !
__label__joy	Thank you . Your cash back is $ 13 . Pull into a parking space . And we'll bring out your fries in two minutes .
__label__joy	Thank you . Goodbye .
__label__joy	The building is quite new and well constructed . I ’ m happy with the fittings too .
__label__surprise	Really ? I ’ m surprised .
__label__joy	You can say that again.The sun is shining and there is a pleasant breeze.It ' s so lovely .
__label__sadness	That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday .
__label__joy	Wow ! You're right ! This refrigerator is great . I'll take it .
__label__sadness	Lily broke up with me last week . In fact , she dumped me .
__label__surprise	Are you nuts ?
__label__joy	Indeed , you're exactly right !
__label__joy	OK . Shall we go to a bar ?
__label__joy	Oh.Jack , I have missed your sense of humor.Ha ha ha ! Nobody else sees things quite like you do.It ' s your gift .
__label__joy	Well , I really envy you for finding such a nice girl .
__label__joy	Oh that's great , congratulations ! What's your new position ?
__label__joy	Thanks . Hey , look at that guy over there . I think he fancies you .
__label__joy	It includes a lot of useful words and phrases .
__label__joy	Thank you . I appreciate the compliment .
__label__joy	Cheer up ! Don't let me down . We all make mistakes , and that is life .
__label__joy	Thank you for the invitation . I'll be very happy to go .
__label__joy	Oh ! Thank you ! It's very kind of you .
__label__joy	I understand.And according to the terms on the contract , I am happy to accept this job . I look forward to it .
__label__joy	So Dick , how about getting some coffee for tonight ?
__label__surprise	Really ? That's good . Is there any supermarket in our neighborhood ?
__label__joy	Well sir , I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose !
__label__joy	I can ’ t thank you enough . I ’ m really touched . I don ’ t know what to say .
__label__joy	I'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
__label__joy	Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your left .
__label__joy	I'd love to . Thanks .
__label__joy	I see . Thanks for your instruction .
__label__surprise	Oh , man ! I can't believe it . A slam dunk !
__label__anger	well , my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night , but he never did .
__label__joy	Great . I forgot to ask you , though . How long did you want the place ?
__label__joy	Does six thirty suit you ?
__label__joy	Let's go . The time is coming .
__label__joy	Hey , two for one . That's a super deal .
__label__joy	I hope that I cleared things up for you .
__label__joy	Well regardless , I'm very happy that you came to see me .
__label__anger	I would like to file a complaint .
__label__joy	Great ! I want a three piece suit , preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool .
__label__joy	Oh , thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Thanks , I'll keep that in mind .
__label__sadness	I am awfully sorry . I didn't think you would mind so much .
__label__sadness	I'm afraid you can ’ t . You ’ re welcome to pay in cash .
__label__sadness	I'm so sorry , I .. I didn't realize it was that loud .
__label__disgust	Stop talking about her . She gives me goose bumps . I never wish to be in her sight .
__label__joy	Very nice . Thank you .
__label__joy	Absolutely .
__label__disgust	It's too raw . I wanted mine well done , but this one here is almost medium .
__label__joy	Yeah , I just got back this morning .
__label__joy	That is very kind of you . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	You are quite right . Thank you for sharing your experience with me . I learned a lot .
__label__joy	Excellent choice . ( He brings her the pie . After she finishes , the waiter comes back . ) Would you like anything else ?
__label__joy	See you tomorrow .
__label__joy	It ’ s really very good .
__label__joy	I'm not sure . I guess I'll just stay at home . Maybe I'll catch up on my reading . What about you ? Any plans ?
__label__joy	I always am . You just didn't notice .
__label__joy	Kim ! I'm here ! I brought all my old maternity clothes plus Dave and Alice's baby clothes !
__label__joy	Well done ! I haven ’ t sent off any job applications yet .
__label__joy	Oh , I like Digital Barbie ! How much does she cost ?
__label__joy	Thanks . Please give me the style in this picture here but make the wave longer . I would like hair spray , please .
__label__joy	I really liked it !
__label__joy	No , Frank . I'm much more interested in collecting stamps now .
__label__disgust	It was boring . The music was too slow and the food was lousy and , above all , I was really sick of the same old crowd all the time .
__label__joy	Yes , please . I'll really appreciate that .
__label__surprise	Of course I remember , actually , I am very surprised you remembered , I thought for sure you would forget .
__label__surprise	Really ? Wow , I don't have to go to school tomorrow .
__label__joy	That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ?
__label__joy	Fine , thank you . And you ?
__label__joy	Tomorrow is Sunday . Let's go out and get some fresh air .
__label__joy	They are beautiful .
__label__joy	You know .. I have a weakness for long dresses .
__label__sadness	Let me see . I am sorry we just have sold it out .
__label__joy	That will be no problem , sir .
__label__joy	Then does it go well with my sweater ?
__label__sadness	I ’ Ve just parted with my boyfriend .
__label__joy	oh , we ’ d like the buffet please . We ’ Ve heard it ’ s very good .
__label__joy	No , I'm just browsing . Thanks anyway .
__label__joy	so nice to see you again , Louise . How are you doing ?
__label__joy	My candidate is probably the most intelligent .
__label__joy	Bye .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	That's great . Well , we'd better get back to our seats . It's about to start .
__label__surprise	I ’ m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ?
__label__joy	Good ! They have expanded and are doing better than they were last quarter . It's nice to see some improvement for a change .
__label__joy	Cafe au lait , cafe latte , cappuccino , cafe mocha ... I can't keep them all straight !
__label__joy	The fragrance of plum blossoms comes from the hard coldness .
__label__joy	Oh yes , I loved it . Wasn't the scene with the judge great ?
__label__sadness	There will be a parents ' meeting in our class this Saturday and I am worried about it .
__label__joy	Why not ? I'd love to !
__label__joy	Thank you . Goodbye .
__label__joy	No , I don't like short hair . I like this one . The wave looks beautiful , and it fits my age too .
__label__joy	Sounds great !
__label__surprise	You're joking !
__label__surprise	Oh , I'm shocked .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , but the price is final .
__label__surprise	You ’ re kidding . It can ’ t be true .
__label__joy	No , seriously . I am impressed .
__label__joy	But the auction is a blast ! And I haven't even told you the best part yet !
__label__joy	I love my candidate .
__label__joy	What did you do after that ?
__label__surprise	Really ? I didn't realize it was so late .
__label__joy	It must be fun . But you know , I am not good at chess . I never won since I've learnt to play chess .
__label__noemo	All right .
__label__joy	Bingo !
__label__noemo	I can't believe it . But if you both determine to divorce , I hope you will have an amicable split .
__label__noemo	While I am at it , would it be possible to switch paint colors ?
__label__noemo	do you think this music is warm matched ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I really need someone who is really good .
__label__noemo	OK ... so it'll come out of my account ? Well , that makes it much easier .
__label__noemo	What's strange about that ! As a person born under the sign of Cancer , I am home-loving and wish for a peaceful family life . But according to astrology , Sagittarius guys are too adventurous and risk-taking.They seldom think of leading a settled and peaceful life .
__label__noemo	I will pick you up at your hotel at eight in the morning .
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ?
__label__joy	We should do this more often .
__label__noemo	I ’ m afraid what you were told is not quite right , if you could meet him in person , and you ’ ll know he ’ s very agreeable and capable .
__label__noemo	He ’ s a bit tired , you know . It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up .
__label__noemo	Hmm ... have you got a receipt ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , that ’ s why I ’ m here . My friends dragged me here , because they think I spend too much time studying .
__label__noemo	Come on , you must tell me everything about him .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'd like to check in , please . M y name is Peter Wang . I have a reservation for three nights .
__label__noemo	Cheer up , I hope you'll feel better soon .
__label__noemo	Oh , I've got an idea . Why don't you ask Dad to go with you ? He badly needs some exercise .
__label__joy	Oh , but Chinese food is so delicious . I wish I knew how to cook Chinese food . Do you follow recipes ?
__label__noemo	Yes , but not two every night . Anyway , the strain was too much for him . He had nervous breakdown and had to go to hospital .
__label__noemo	Oh , come on ! I just gave them my e-mail , my address and my phone number . And my name , of course .
__label__noemo	I hear little Bob has recovered .
__label__noemo	What's the weather like in winter ?
__label__noemo	I'll refund your money right now .
__label__noemo	All right . Have a seat , please . Let me ask you a few questions . First of all , may I have your name , please ?
__label__noemo	Here's one little hint . If you don't go out right now , this won't be under the tree .
__label__noemo	I know . I figure as long as there ’ s nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ?
__label__anger	It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .
__label__noemo	You need at least $ 100 in your account .
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	Sure . Here it is .
__label__noemo	All right . I'll do that .
__label__noemo	I'm a student , and I have a part-time job , too .
__label__noemo	What should I do in the fair ?
__label__noemo	It costs money , dear . What ’ s wrong with the regular television stations ?
__label__noemo	That's too late . You see , November is the season for this commodity in our market , and our Customs formalities are rather complicated .
__label__noemo	We will consider the first part of the year , in your particular field , and your credit rating can be no less than class A , during that period .
__label__joy	Listen ! Some people are singing outside . Is it the opera ?
__label__noemo	He's number four .
__label__noemo	Yes , I think I speak English quite fluently . I got a high score on TOEFL . I majored in English in college .
__label__noemo	If the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend.It ' s been a while since I've not really gotten some sun .
__label__noemo	No . Thank you .
__label__noemo	I need to copy a document immediately .
__label__noemo	Midnight is zero and when you put the minutes in , make sure that you show them with a dot followed by the minutes . Do you understand ?
__label__noemo	And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?
__label__noemo	Yes , lots of time . I was quite impressed by the wide variety of exhibitions they have .
__label__noemo	Is this Ann ?
__label__joy	Good luck ! I ’ Ve heard it ’ s very difficult to get a visa to go to the united states .
__label__noemo	I plan on going back to school .
__label__joy	You're welcome . Enjoy your meal . Press the call button if you need any more help .
__label__noemo	Jim White .
__label__noemo	Four . They are production department , finance department , sales and marketing department and HR department . I directly report to Mr . White . He is on a business trip and is suppose to be back this morning . Probably you will be meeting him at lunch .
__label__anger	I wish he could understand . You know what , if this goes on , I think I will get stick like everybody else .
__label__joy	We are all the same the first time we travel overseas . You guys have a nice trip .
__label__joy	Well . You know I hate walking , but I can ’ t wait to see your guys ’ video .
__label__noemo	You'd better give up smoking . It's bad for your health .
__label__noemo	I don't think so . It changes so quickly this time .
__label__noemo	But he's really kind at heart .
__label__noemo	That's fine with me , but we'll have to get there early . Because after 8 pm , there is always a long line .
__label__noemo	My long-term goal is to become an expert in this field .
__label__noemo	Your request for compensation makes me surprised . What happened ?
__label__noemo	Ok . I ’ ll miss you . I hope we can see each other again soon .
__label__noemo	It's a job I have been dreaming of for many years . While it is difficult , I am convinced that there is nothing more noble and rewarding than this profession .
__label__noemo	Just in Beijing , people consume 300,000 pieces of gum every day .
__label__noemo	Do you like Barry ?
__label__noemo	Let me see ... my right arm ... oh , to the east .
__label__joy	That's great . I'll pick you up at eight .
__label__noemo	You ’ d better hurry !
__label__noemo	Sure . It's the third office down this hall . Are you looking for Bob ?
__label__noemo	Yes , this is the Resume Writing Workshop . Welcome !
__label__noemo	Are you looking for shoes ?
__label__noemo	Good game ?
__label__noemo	Really ? I'II take it and I'm leaving here tomorrow . Is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you get it in ?
__label__noemo	What ’ s your polling place ?
__label__noemo	What kind of people you find hard to work with ?
__label__noemo	May I take a bus to get there ?
__label__joy	Yes . We'll have our baby soon .
__label__noemo	She's from Australia . She lives in Sydney . Her father runs a hotel business there and she is doing a degree in accountancy .
__label__noemo	If you were choosing a person for this job , what kind of individual would you select ?
__label__noemo	Of course , sir .
__label__noemo	Where is the boss ? I need him to sign a few documents . I checked in his office , but he is not there . Is he out of the office now ?
__label__joy	Ok , good luck to you .
__label__sadness	I don't know if anything terrible has happened .
__label__noemo	I can smell you , too .
__label__sadness	Sorry . I didn't mean to .
__label__noemo	That ’ s all there is to it .
__label__noemo	I have to wear it this afternoon . Do you have a urgent service ?
__label__noemo	Pretty well , thanks . We ’ Ve just been incredibly busy ! I need to set up a meeting for Mr . Graham .
__label__noemo	What kind of question is that ?
__label__noemo	What did you buy ?
__label__noemo	Ask me a question now .
__label__noemo	I've got all the cords plugged in , but it appears that I'm offline .
__label__noemo	Perhaps you saw a silverfish , sir .
__label__joy	Thank goodness . It is still there . Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	If I do try to do anything , I ’ d only be sent off with a flea in my ear .
__label__noemo	Let me read that back to you , 123 456 789 , Mary from Happy Travel . I'll ask him to get back you as soon as he can .
__label__noemo	So I have another question for you . What do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ?
__label__joy	Yes , of course .
__label__noemo	I have confidence in them .
__label__noemo	You ’ re welcome . I appreciate your coming .
__label__noemo	That's seems obvious enough . Then what about the software ?
__label__noemo	I do too . That way we can have our activities planned ahead of time .
__label__joy	When can we expect you for dinner ? Can you come tonight ?
__label__noemo	Well , I guess no one can help me but myself . For the moment , I just need someone to talk to so that I can relieve my stress .
__label__noemo	Yes . I was Propaganda department minister of our university .
__label__noemo	Here it is .
__label__noemo	I was going to eat in , I'm short on cash .
__label__noemo	Do you intend to take it out on your departure ?
__label__noemo	No need to sweat it . My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding , which is going to be low-budget anyway . So roughly four hundred people , which means that the hall at Northwoods Heights will be our reception venue . I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents ’ church and my uncle of course would be officiating . We ’ ll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling . The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer . My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that . My cousin will be the official photographer . I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo . Did you know that she ’ s going to be a professional opera singer ?
__label__noemo	How would you like to pay for it ?
__label__joy	Thanks for noticing .
__label__noemo	That's because it's time .
__label__noemo	Is it ready to be picked up ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Not a chance .
__label__noemo	How did it finish ?
__label__noemo	I like it . But how did you know about my new job ? I wanted to surprise you .
__label__joy	I'm only too happy to help .
__label__noemo	I don't know . I hope it's nothing serious .
__label__joy	Sure , I'd love to .
__label__noemo	13.50 ?
__label__noemo	Good morning . I ’ m Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . We have an appointment with Mr . Thomas .
__label__noemo	Haven't we been these places already ?
__label__noemo	But , if we all pushed our way in , nobody could get off , and nobody could get in either .
__label__noemo	Let ’ s try going with three hundred and thirty thousand dollars for a counter-offer .
__label__noemo	Not too long.Cut a little off behind and on both sides , too .
__label__joy	The most important thing is that you bought it for me . I am happy that you know my size and style .
__label__noemo	Did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked ?
__label__noemo	I have a major stomachache
__label__joy	That sounds good to me . I'll have the same .
__label__joy	I have no idea . Let me take a closer look at my museum map
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Sure . You can find everything all over the world . Let's check it out online ! ( They log in a shopping website . )
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__joy	He certainly is . He is the Peckham in our collage .
__label__noemo	I haven ’ t been able to take a deep breath lately , and I need to know why .
__label__joy	You got it !
__label__noemo	Right you are , Paler , and since what you want to learn is how to use software , we should also learn to refer to the computer menus .
__label__noemo	Do you have any information about the city sights ?
__label__noemo	C - A - R - O - L . Carol .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t see any problem ; only the car is a bit old .
__label__noemo	What ’ s the number you are calling , please ?
__label__joy	Would you like to go to a party tonight ?
__label__noemo	No , I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean , if I look back on your previous presentations , this is a huge improvement .
__label__noemo	Yes , it sure is . The L / C number is JD185649000023 .
__label__noemo	That ’ s right . That ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species .
__label__noemo	Yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , I haven't had the need or the opportunity . Every time I try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes .
__label__noemo	We ’ ll see .
__label__noemo	I ’ m afraid that ’ s not my cup of tea . I just find skin-diving attracting .
__label__noemo	Is what you said really true ?
__label__noemo	Take your time .
__label__joy	I'll get my things and meet you there .
__label__joy	Thank you . I ’ ll try my best .
__label__noemo	I'm going to be studying overseas next year and I'd like some info about suitable loans . To be honest , I'm not even sure if I can get a loan .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll stand in with you if you like . I ’ Ve got nothing else to do .
__label__noemo	By this time , it's better . The rush hour is over .
__label__noemo	As I see it , he lacks the proper vision . His style is more about survival , and he's not taking the company anywhere.He ' s treading water instead of swimming .
__label__noemo	Good morning .
__label__noemo	Would you please wrap the shoes first ? I would like to buy a sweater .
__label__noemo	It's not easy to find . Anyway , you can come to my home after school today and try .
__label__joy	I ’ m not surprised . That article certainly added fuel to the debate . Ok . Thanks . Can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me ? I ’ d like to read them .
__label__noemo	That's why many people died in the earthquake .
__label__noemo	You'll see it's black and has burnt smell .
__label__noemo	Sure , company rules are not very strict at this point .
__label__joy	Thank you ! Have a nice day !
__label__noemo	My major is Automobile Designing and I have received my master's degree in science . I think I can do it well .
__label__noemo	I thought you were my friend and would support me on this ! I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive .
__label__noemo	Here is your bill . It comes to 80 yuan . And yours is 60 yuan .
__label__noemo	Here's the hotel .
__label__noemo	What did you want to order ?
__label__noemo	Doctor , I have a bad cough and a headache .
__label__noemo	You mean 30 push-ups ?
__label__noemo	Good coming , sir .
__label__noemo	Oh , I forget . Who ’ s invited ?
__label__noemo	Day , I'm home .
__label__noemo	Your wish is our command . Expect a call at 7 , and another one at 7 fifteen .
__label__noemo	What part of the visit excited you most ?
__label__noemo	That's it , but will I be able to add more channels at another time ?
__label__noemo	Does it bite or scratch ?
__label__noemo	I don't think so . I'll create further achievement in the future .
__label__noemo	I need to effect a payment under my L / C . Not the old one , the new one my Assistant came in and dealt with last week .
__label__noemo	In what room is this pipe ?
__label__surprise	Really ? That's good news for me .
__label__joy	I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful .
__label__noemo	Unfortunately , sir , you'll have to pay the $ 2 , whether you like it or not .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry , but I have an appointment this evening.How about tomorrow evening ?
__label__noemo	May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ?
__label__noemo	Look it up in the dictionary .
__label__noemo	What's wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ?
__label__noemo	But he was trying to beat about the bush . And my talk with him was fruitless .
__label__noemo	Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ?
__label__noemo	That's fine . I'll be waiting for you .
__label__surprise	What ’ s wrong ? Didn ’ t you think it was fun ? !
__label__noemo	When will your wedding take place ?
__label__noemo	And what is more , in traditional Chinese thinking , cranes and pine trees symbolize longevity .
__label__noemo	What's the number , please .
__label__joy	I see what you mean . That was pretty easy after all .
__label__noemo	Certainly , madam . What kind of coffee would you like ?
__label__joy	Sure , here you are .
__label__noemo	Could you come to the station for more questioning ?
__label__noemo	How long does the route No . 5 last ?
__label__noemo	That's the reason I want to finish my B . A . in four years.Because I know I will be in school a long time . I want to start the M . A . and Ph . D . program as soon as possible .
__label__noemo	Sure . By all means please do . Please take a seat .
__label__noemo	Wonderful . How much is the cost altogether ?
__label__noemo	Good morning . Vane Theater , at your service .
__label__noemo	Well , a way to make a living , of course , but beyond that I think a job is a way of developing oneself as a person .
__label__noemo	I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter .
__label__noemo	All right . I have a registered then .
__label__noemo	What ’ s the rush ? You ’ re not leaving for another week .
__label__noemo	Hi ! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection .
__label__joy	I ’ ll keep that in mind . Thank you for coming in today . We ’ ll be in touch .
__label__noemo	He was actually quite handsome . What a shame .
__label__noemo	Aren't you lucky . The vintage-clock guy is driving a hard bargain . So I have nothing .
__label__noemo	I didn't say I was going to deprive myself .
__label__surprise	Oh , wow ! It's really him ! Who is that woman he's with ?
__label__noemo	We have to send it to landfill . It's very expensive because the government recently introduced a landfill tax so we're planning to build a new incineration plant next year to burn our waste .
__label__noemo	Give it to me .
__label__joy	Jenny , I want to go on a picnic . Could you come too ?
__label__noemo	So do we have to stay in this English class forever ?
__label__noemo	I know a few extensions but I don't know them all .
__label__noemo	May I have your name , please ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I don't think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
__label__noemo	I should get the items within a week . But in the meantime I'm bidding on a digital video camera .
__label__noemo	They went to their stores to get one . Here they come with it now !
__label__noemo	Oh , good ! You know , I am looking at my plate and I ordered scrambled eggs , not fried .
__label__noemo	Ok . Let's compromise . If you agree to only spend 75 on books , I'll agree to only spend 40 for my next shirt .
__label__noemo	No . Except for the rash , I feel fine .
__label__joy	I would like to compliment you on your diligence .
__label__noemo	Yes , actually , the song has been sung since its publication in 1932.People all over the world have sung it in many different languages .
__label__joy	Was it love at first sight ?
__label__noemo	What's wrong with it ?
__label__noemo	Thanks .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve been under stress , but no more than usual .
__label__noemo	You think so ?
__label__noemo	Any chance of using your telephone ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m going to work at the polling place .
__label__noemo	That ’ s really not my problem .
__label__joy	Sure . What time ?
__label__noemo	That's not the gadgets . Creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . It engages their imagination and sharpen their mind .
__label__noemo	One dollar .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes . I think I'll look at those over there before I decide .
__label__noemo	Yes , of course.It was nice to see you .
__label__noemo	Yes . Here it is . I bought them last week .
__label__noemo	Is there anything I can do for you ?
__label__noemo	Hi , Mr . Smith . This is Mary . Is Jenny there ?
__label__noemo	Caroline Menzies speaking .
__label__noemo	Yes , I know how to get there on my own .
__label__noemo	What do you think of the speech the man delivered just now ?
__label__noemo	how long is it altogether ?
__label__noemo	What day was your appointment on ?
__label__noemo	Maybe just a quick sandwich , salad , or something .
__label__joy	Now , you are to board the plane.We ' re sorry that we haven't done much to help you when you stayed in China .
__label__noemo	what is the greenhouse effect exactly ?
__label__joy	I main market reasearch , and you ?
__label__noemo	Do you love me ? come on , I ’ m eager to hear .
__label__noemo	You have got a great mother .
__label__noemo	But we couldn't help it .
__label__noemo	He should know that this is against the Labor Law in our country . Legally , employees should get double pay if asked to do extra work during the weekend or on holidays .
__label__noemo	I guess the fax machine is out of paper , too . Don't worry , I'll have someone look at it this afternoon , and in the meantime , I'll have your documents re-faxed to our other fax machine .
__label__noemo	What information will be in that letter ?
__label__noemo	What kinds of work were you in charge of in the previous company ?
__label__noemo	I prefer the tragedy . It is moving and makes me ponder about my life .
__label__noemo	Such concern for the company , Craig ! I'm impressed .
__label__noemo	Let's just say there could be some big changes around here .
__label__noemo	Hi , Bob , everything okay ?
__label__noemo	Well , considering your qualifications , we believe you would be a suitable candidate .
__label__noemo	Yes . I'd like to change some money , please .
__label__joy	Sure ! You just basically gotta let the caller know who they called , and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back .
__label__noemo	That is true . I hope it doesn't rain .
__label__noemo	I've never tried E-shopping . Is it better than shopping at an actual store ?
__label__noemo	Well , actually , it's quite a substantial amount . Here's my Bank Book . Will that cause a problem ?
__label__noemo	Thank you . I can't imagine the design of the new computer is so popular among computer users .
__label__noemo	Okay , I think I understand .
__label__noemo	Amy , could you help me with this work ?
__label__noemo	Oh , no . We've bought your return ticket for you . I think you'll find it comfortable .
__label__joy	I totally agree !
__label__noemo	You're actually standing above it . Just take the elevator or stairs down one level .
__label__noemo	I didn't know you paint . What type of painting is it ?
__label__noemo	Why not ? Let me recommend a website .
__label__noemo	I can ’ t disclose that information .
__label__joy	Thank you so much , Mr . Sandals . We look forward to seeing you !
__label__noemo	I suggest we visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art first , Now let's go.look people are jogging along the river.Here we are .
__label__noemo	Is his father a worker ?
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , I didn't mean to forget our wedding anniversary .
__label__noemo	Yes , you are right .
__label__noemo	Thanks . I had learned so much from you and our colleagues .
__label__noemo	A good atmosphere ? The tree is falling apart , and it ’ s messing up the room .
__label__noemo	Yes . I suppose so .
__label__noemo	No , not yet , but someone ’ s going to have to .
__label__noemo	Perhaps you would like some sole . Many guests like it very much .
__label__noemo	Do you have medical insurance ?
__label__noemo	Well , that's only $ 4000 . Didn't you tell me your budget was $ 5000 ? Where is the rest of the money ?
__label__noemo	Is this taxi taken ?
__label__noemo	Do you have an appointment , Mr . Liu ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I have lost about ten kilos .
__label__noemo	Okay .
__label__noemo	Yes , what do you have for appetizer ?
__label__noemo	That's over by the paper towels and toilet paper .
__label__joy	I'm always at your service .
__label__noemo	Isn ’ t that Michael Johnson ? I think he set a world record in this race .
__label__noemo	Next time you see him , please tell him I'm thinking of him .
__label__noemo	Is there anybody acting as mediator in the dispute ?
__label__noemo	I can speak French and German .
__label__noemo	I know you're right , but what can I do ?
__label__noemo	No , it ’ s beef .
__label__noemo	Why don ’ t you go ahead of me ? I have more items than you .
__label__noemo	Thanks , good to meet you , too .
__label__noemo	This is room 504.The room is so cold .
__label__noemo	How much is the brown one ?
__label__noemo	First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously .
__label__noemo	No , we guarantee the quality .
__label__joy	Well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ?
__label__noemo	Do you have any style in your mind ?
__label__noemo	He watch the tob too much . Now really I don't know . But I can't handle this much longer .
__label__noemo	Yes . I am very interested in the Olympic Games , and I'm especially excited about 2008 Beijing Olympics .
__label__noemo	Hello .
__label__noemo	No . It's only a five-minute walk . You can't miss it .
__label__noemo	How about your one-year-old baby ?
__label__noemo	I want some coffee .
__label__noemo	Well , sure it is . Actually , I have been cutting down the amount since two months ago . I used to smoke a pack of cigarettes for a single day . Now I limit it to 6 cigarettes a day .
__label__noemo	let's go shopping . You can't depend on public phones in this day and age !
__label__noemo	Sure . You can buy almost anything you can think of .
__label__noemo	Almost three weeks .
__label__joy	Great !
__label__noemo	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	I am sorry , I don't know .
__label__noemo	No , but I have database programming experience and network knowledge .
__label__noemo	Everything in this magazine seems expensive . You could probably find something similar in a discount store .
__label__noemo	Well , maybe we could get it now and hide it until his birthday .
__label__noemo	Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .
__label__noemo	He hits below the belt .
__label__noemo	Why ? I mean , what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?
__label__noemo	I read something like that once . I think it was , ' Life is in the breath . '
__label__noemo	Does he mean I am inquisitive or I ’ m noisy ?
__label__noemo	If you refuse to take risk , you can ’ t have better returns .
__label__noemo	Oh , I don't want to trouble you .
__label__noemo	No where special . I was just taking a walk .
__label__joy	This is the very thing I've been dreaming of .
__label__noemo	Me ! Me !
__label__noemo	Can you speak Japanese ?
__label__noemo	Okay , so are you going to school tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	What ? You feel sorry for the butterflies ?
__label__joy	No , thanks . I've had enough.Now , Mary , before you blow out the birthday candles , you have to make a wish.After that , you may cut the cake .
__label__noemo	That's really a big change from 20 % . I really can't accept that .
__label__noemo	Nope , I do not have a membership yet .
__label__noemo	Mary , I heard you moved again .
__label__noemo	That's okay . I can explain a little .
__label__noemo	Well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .
__label__joy	I got it a while ago , but I haven't worn it much . You really like it ?
__label__noemo	Just a minute . It's ten to nine by my watch .
__label__noemo	There's just one catch . Zina asked me to let you know .
__label__noemo	Because I don't want any , er , do you understand ? But you are quite sure , are you ?
__label__noemo	I guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat .
__label__noemo	Welcome to Beijing . This is my business card . I'm an engineer . If you need any help in Beijing , just give me a call .
__label__noemo	Maybe we can try ' Yuanyang pot ' this time . You can choose the non-spicy soup base .
__label__noemo	Listen , Nancy . If I don't work hard , I will be laid off .
__label__noemo	I'd like to exchange 3,000 .
__label__noemo	Have some more tea , George .
__label__noemo	I see .
__label__noemo	This is tough to say , John , but I think we should break up .
__label__noemo	May I help you ?
__label__surprise	I can't even imagine you snorkeling !
__label__noemo	Oh , I see .
__label__noemo	Is this our bus stop ?
__label__noemo	Maybe not . Dust is no longer a big problem in Beijing .
__label__noemo	Hello . May I help you ?
__label__noemo	It is real word .
__label__noemo	I'm sure of what I'm doing .
__label__noemo	I hope so .
__label__noemo	I'm here for a facial . I made an appointment over the phone for 3:30 today .
__label__noemo	You know what ? I've recently been teaching myself French .
__label__noemo	Charles ? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here ?
__label__noemo	Www , man !
__label__noemo	That ’ s just it ! I don ’ t know what to get her ! Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small ! I suck at getting presents for people .
__label__noemo	Well , happy birthday . If it was sent yesterday using the usual service , it should be here already . You do have an account with us , right ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I would also like some sweet and sour sauce and pepper .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I'm afraid so . I really need your help here .
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__surprise	On the level ?
__label__sadness	Oh , breaktime flies .
__label__noemo	They are puzzles . It's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the Lantern Festival .
__label__noemo	We had some shoes like those a month ago , but we don't have any now .
__label__noemo	Why isn't the project done yet ?
__label__noemo	So let's start by checking off what we've already done .
__label__noemo	We are tired of jobs and competition . We need a quiet place .
__label__noemo	It depends.But usually it's about 15 days .
__label__noemo	Yes , I have .
__label__noemo	Maybe we could get some new furniture . Better stuff .
__label__noemo	What ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	How many parking tickets have you gotten before ?
__label__noemo	Finally !
__label__noemo	I haven't shopped there . How is the food ?
__label__noemo	You too . Have you lost some weight ?
__label__noemo	I don't think so . I say the weather report last night , and it said the weather should be fine all day .
__label__noemo	The Spur .
__label__noemo	All right .
__label__noemo	Yes , the cost for dry-cleaning is three times of that for ordinary laundering . But for suits and sweaters , you can only take them to the dry cleaners ' .
__label__noemo	We have many loans on offer . May I ask what the purpose of the loan is ?
__label__noemo	No ...
__label__noemo	Okay . Here you are .
__label__noemo	Sure . As for our financial situation , you can inquire about them in the national bank . They handle all our financial documents .
__label__noemo	It's too bad for the environment . So much pollution from cars .
__label__noemo	It's not like him to be late .
__label__noemo	hello ! What are you reading about in the newspaper ?
__label__noemo	What's your name ?
__label__noemo	Don ’ t say that . It owes to your efforts and team spirit .
__label__noemo	Yes . We say “ eat well and drink well . ”
__label__noemo	Never .
__label__noemo	Those are possible problems , but tell me , when you turn the key , do you hear the starter motor crank ?
__label__noemo	Fine .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I was hoping you'd say that . It's nice to have the option to go out but I'd rather stay in . Maybe we can go out tomorrow night .
__label__noemo	Thanks , Mr . Liang .
__label__noemo	How can you do that ?
__label__noemo	I am sorry to hear that you are not feeling well . How are you ?
__label__noemo	Let me see . I am sorry we just have sold it out .
__label__noemo	But how can I prevent a deficit ?
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Do you think so ? I don ’ t like girls who look like that . I like girls who are not too slim . If you like her , go and talk to her .
__label__noemo	Sheila , what time should we meet tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	have you been working hard recently ?
__label__noemo	You think so ?
__label__joy	This salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day .
__label__noemo	To be honest , I'm really fed up with work at the moment . I need a break !
__label__noemo	So what do you do , exactly ?
__label__noemo	Why is that ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , we have to do something to help the people in the stricken area .
__label__surprise	I have to be at court ?
__label__noemo	I only attend class part-time in the evenings .
__label__joy	that'd be great . Thanks ! What time should I come over ?
__label__noemo	I have always enjoyed flying . And I am good with people .
__label__surprise	a guy I met on the internet three month ago .
__label__noemo	Let me see . I am terribly sorry , sir . That should be $ 18 .
__label__anger	I have rights , don't I ?
__label__noemo	All right . Have you handed in my report to him ?
__label__noemo	Do you have any idea for this vacation ?
__label__noemo	What is the length of time that you have worked at the job you have now ?
__label__noemo	He has introduced the company details to me .
__label__joy	Don ’ t you worry , I ’ ll take care of everything ! ( starts cutting ) Oh my god ! I just love your curly hair ! It ’ s so fluffy and cute ! You should totally let it grow out . An afro would look great on you !
__label__noemo	How were your scores in university ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I like the job though . Sometimes , I help other people in the office if they ’ re having trouble online .
__label__noemo	Hi , do you have any tickets for the show tonight ?
__label__noemo	Usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . They meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . They provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line .
__label__noemo	Maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting .
__label__joy	That's a good idea . Let's see if we can get more people in this plan . There isn't much business these days anyway , so I think many people will be interested .
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__noemo	I think so . I bought some paper plates and cups for people to use . It will save on the washing up !
__label__noemo	Yes , the address is 541 Main street .
__label__joy	Have a nice trip .
__label__noemo	Nice to meet you .
__label__noemo	Same here , Ms . Drake . I've been looking forward to this .
__label__noemo	OK . I will send them now .
__label__noemo	You always say that , but we never win anything ! What will you do if you win a lot of money ?
__label__noemo	Calm down !
__label__noemo	Hmm ... I sometimes like mysteries , but I don't think I'm in the mood for one right now .
__label__sadness	I'm so sorry to disturb you so early .
__label__joy	Don ’ t worry about them . They ’ re very responsible . Besides , there are many people there and there ’ s lifeguard employed by the hotel . Waiter ! Could I have another drink pleas ? Thank you . So , what shall we do this evening ?
__label__noemo	Mom called just now saying that she and Dad will be back later . Do you want to speak to them on phone ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry to hear about that . Why don ’ t you join me for a hot cup of tea ? It ’ ll be good for you !
__label__joy	Yes , that ’ s all right . Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	I hope the teacher decides to curve our test grades .
__label__noemo	We came too early . There're still three hours before the performance starts .
__label__noemo	Didn't you read about Paypal and Bidpai ? They are very safe .
__label__noemo	I'm really into watching foreign films . what about you ?
__label__noemo	Thank you , Mr.Wang.Do you have an appointment ?
__label__noemo	Hello , this is Francis .
__label__noemo	That's the transfer completed . Can I do anything else for you today ?
__label__noemo	And , to be frank , our copying machines are too slow ; our telephone system is limited in function .
__label__noemo	Rudeness . You are not expected to sit down before being invited , and you shouldn ’ t throw yourself into the chair like you ’ re loading heavy baggage .
__label__noemo	Oh I see . So what did you do then ?
__label__noemo	No . I've never been there .
__label__noemo	Billy , you are late again .
__label__noemo	So that concludes the introduction . Now let's move to the first part of my talk , which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan . So first , right off the bat , When looking at the marketing plan , tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with ...
__label__noemo	I joined Samsung Health Club a couple of months ago .
__label__sadness	I'm really sorry , Ethan . I tried so hard , but I'm afraid I could't find a Dutch restaurant in town . The best I could do was a German one about 15 minutes from here .
__label__anger	I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game !
__label__noemo	Fine , thank you . Are you coming for the interview as a secretary ? What's your name ?
__label__joy	See you tonight .
__label__noemo	Yes , once last week .
__label__noemo	What kind of personality do you think you have ?
__label__noemo	Oh , yes , this is much better . But it has an aluminum handle .
__label__noemo	That's too bad , anyway , I'm sure things will turn around next semester .
__label__noemo	That's better .
__label__noemo	Yes , but you might have told me before .
__label__noemo	Left for the fork and right for the knife . Just remember that the stronger one is for knife .
__label__noemo	She has blond hair and blue eyes .
__label__noemo	This is Joey from Mary trading company . I learned that you are the leading export of cloth by Hummed company .
__label__noemo	Put me down for 2 years . Here's the money I'd like to pay in ...
__label__noemo	I count all of the correct answers , total them , and divide by the total . Does this look right to you ?
__label__joy	Thank you for saying that .
__label__joy	Thank you so much .
__label__noemo	The process of actually making the offer is something that I will take care of for you . What price were you considering offering ?
__label__noemo	When I fill out the Continued Claim Form , what will I need to tell them ?
__label__noemo	I will take you to Li River after walking around here .
__label__noemo	And the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision ?
__label__joy	Good luck .
__label__joy	Good , and would you care for soup or salad to start with ?
__label__noemo	May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Oh , hey ...
__label__noemo	Yes . Let's go Dutch .
__label__noemo	I can ’ t find my purse . Have you seen it ?
__label__noemo	Are we allowed to go into the stacks to look for books ?
__label__joy	Can I help in anyway ?
__label__joy	That's exactly why my business is doing so well !
__label__noemo	You ’ re right about that .
__label__joy	Thank you very much . By the way , where are the vegetables ?
__label__noemo	then , I might as well have them made .
__label__joy	Hey , it's an English song ! Sing with us , Ryan !
__label__noemo	Hi , Stephanie . I hear you have a new job .
__label__noemo	Yes . I overheard your mom and my mom talking in the grocery store .
__label__noemo	The insurance policy protects us .
__label__noemo	If I win a lot of money , I shall buy you a mink coat .
__label__noemo	I beg your pardon ?
__label__noemo	yes , it's my girlfriend's birthday today and she loves chocolate .
__label__disgust	If I remember , he got off with a light sentence . Something like three years in a minimum-security prison .
__label__noemo	Well start out from Long Island this Friday . We've planned a four day drive to Salt Lake City , where we'll join my brother and his family on his fortieth birthday .
__label__noemo	Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company ?
__label__noemo	I see . You must be tough .
__label__joy	Good afternoon ! Sit down , please.How are you ?
__label__noemo	Welcome to Beijing . Is this your first time in China ?
__label__noemo	This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ’ m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee !
__label__noemo	Ok , I will . But let ’ s go to a disco after dinner .
__label__noemo	John , you look pale . What happened ?
__label__noemo	Until then .
__label__joy	Thanks ! We love it .
__label__noemo	Right ... anything else ?
__label__noemo	What do you do there ?
__label__noemo	OK , I'll call ahead .
__label__disgust	The food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone .
__label__noemo	Just a minute ... go to this one . I ’ ll send you an email with the line in it . It only takes a few minutes to download . Then you have to go through the set up procedures . But they are not complicated .
__label__noemo	Oh no , Ari . I didn ’ t mean for you to pay for me when I invited you to go tonight . Let ’ s go Dutch . I ’ ll pay my own way . I insist .
__label__noemo	But I don't have any reading assignments .
__label__noemo	Be seeing you then !
__label__noemo	Yes . Also , I'm not so sure about the color .
__label__noemo	Well , I actually thumbed a lift .
__label__disgust	I don ’ t think I can take another semester of this dorm food .
__label__noemo	They're also way younger than us .
__label__joy	Sure . Now you are talking .
__label__noemo	What ’ s the plot of your new movie ?
__label__noemo	I never thought about that , but you're right . What do you think we should do ?
__label__noemo	Are there many things online ?
__label__noemo	Well , we have most of the furniture already.We mostly need kitchen utensils , bathroom accessories , cleaning and laundry accessories--things like that.And Albert wants to set up a little off
__label__noemo	Would you like everything on it ?
__label__noemo	Hello , can I speak to Mark Wyatt , please ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to , but I'm afraid I can't .
__label__noemo	Yes . I worked at AB Company .
__label__noemo	How many stops are there ?
__label__noemo	W-Y-A-T-T , Got it . I haven ’ t heard of the name.Could you hold on the line when I check .
__label__noemo	Yes , it is . Do you know where I can get a town map ?
__label__noemo	The completion date will be July 1st 2007 .
__label__noemo	Mangoes . What are they ?
__label__noemo	OK . You can keep it as long as you need .
__label__noemo	Do you have your library card ?
__label__noemo	Would you like to sit in a smoking section , a non-smoking section or whatever comes open first ?
__label__noemo	Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy . or a kitty !
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Um . It ’ s delicious .
__label__noemo	Oh , I wouldn't worry about it .
__label__noemo	Come in please .
__label__noemo	I would recommend DEL .
__label__noemo	Yes , they seemed to click at the meeting the other day .
__label__noemo	We have two dressings for salad . Which one would you like ?
__label__disgust	I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
__label__noemo	Believe I will . Look for me near the lake .
__label__noemo	Now or later ?
__label__noemo	But it's the truth .
__label__joy	Such a lovely girl . I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday !
__label__noemo	Don't take too long . It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather .
__label__noemo	I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . I'm your new neighbor , Jack . I just moved in .
__label__noemo	Oh , that's not the same . I never pay for hotel souvenirs !
__label__noemo	No , Sharon Stone did .
__label__noemo	Wow , I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast , honey .
__label__noemo	But aren't the kids tired out ? I mean , they go to school all day , and then they go to school in the evening too .
__label__noemo	Well , most of my time here was pleasant . And New York itself is fantastic .
__label__noemo	Of course , you have . You must try harder this time .
__label__noemo	Although I could not say that everything is perfect there , I still very much appreciate what the company has given me , especial many chances .
__label__noemo	Do you have any experience working with a computer ?
__label__noemo	Everything looks so good . Is there anything in particular that you recommend ?
__label__noemo	That's a pretty short essay .
__label__noemo	I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ?
__label__noemo	Hey , Steven . What are you going to do this Saturday ?
__label__noemo	Why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air .
__label__noemo	Do you still want both classes ?
__label__noemo	Sorry , sir , here you are .
__label__noemo	There are student passes .
__label__noemo	Well , I think you look very pretty in your polka dot purple dress with your hair piled at the rear . That makes you very graceful and mysterious .
__label__noemo	Yes , of course . How about this one ? It's a new route .
__label__noemo	Yes , it is . But even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done.Have you ever been in an emergency room before ?
__label__noemo	Well . He doesn't wear ties that often .
__label__noemo	I've been learning Japanese every evening .
__label__noemo	She is a barking dog . But she means well .
__label__noemo	I see , that's a long time . How much was the watch ?
__label__noemo	Two small boxes .
__label__noemo	Can I list my interests next ?
__label__noemo	Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life.Parents usually try to discour
__label__noemo	If I ever decide to leave before the three years , will there be a problem ?
__label__noemo	She sounds very emotional .
__label__noemo	Well , I don't have any cash with me , I'll have to put it on a credit .
__label__noemo	I ’ d be glad to make a deal with you .
__label__noemo	Mom , my nose is bleeding .
__label__noemo	Could we have the bill , please ?
__label__noemo	I am trying to call home .
__label__noemo	I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me , rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish .
__label__noemo	No , Why don't we just grad a bite at the coffee shop next door ?
__label__noemo	We'd better prepare for the worst .
__label__joy	Don ’ t mention it . I ’ Ve really enjoyed your company .
__label__joy	Good night .
__label__noemo	I can ’ t find the business card . Do you know the address ?
__label__noemo	Okay . That will be thirty-four dollars and fifty cents .
__label__noemo	Steven , have you got better now ?
__label__noemo	I am dieting , so could the chef prepare the food with no extra sauce ?
__label__noemo	I especially like this flowery skirts . My fiancee will look very elegant in this .
__label__noemo	Well , OK . But no French kissing !
__label__noemo	Say it .
__label__noemo	I think Andy's party will be fun .
__label__noemo	Here you go .
__label__noemo	OK . Keep me informed . Jt must be ready on time .
__label__noemo	so , you must be pretty interested in photography then .
__label__noemo	That is the most boring , typical gift in the world !
__label__noemo	And when is your son's birthday ?
__label__noemo	Singing ? At the subway exit ? Oh , it sounds like someone needs some money .
__label__noemo	I'm going to refund your money right now .
__label__noemo	Your present job is something better . Why do you change ?
__label__noemo	I like this shirt.How much is it ?
__label__surprise	What ? Do you think someone will arrest me for making a joke ? Someone will arrest me here at the breakfast table ?
__label__noemo	Well , both have advantages and disadvantages .
__label__noemo	Well , it's only three stops from here .
__label__noemo	I can , but not as well as I'd like to . I'll be studying Chinese until the day I die !
__label__noemo	Operator . May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Are they all right ?
__label__noemo	well that's what being friends is about , isn't it ?
__label__sadness	I've been having a hard time sleeping lately .
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	Well , you always say you're busy .
__label__noemo	There were some gaps in your report . Please be more sorrow .
__label__noemo	Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ?
__label__noemo	Hmm . You ’ Ve got mail .
__label__noemo	Professional suits may be the best choice .
__label__noemo	How much is it ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m going to work .
__label__noemo	We are redecorating and I'm going to add some things .
__label__noemo	That can easily be arranged . I will arrange a comfortable meeting room for them . Anything else ?
__label__noemo	Just say the word , sir .
__label__noemo	Is that going to take long ?
__label__noemo	This Saturday .
__label__noemo	I do a good old lady . I wouldn't mind being the damsel in distress once in a while .
__label__noemo	Did you have anything specific in mind ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much for doing this interview .
__label__sadness	Oh , no ! I can't have failed . Are you sure ?
__label__noemo	Are things still going badly with your houseguest ?
__label__noemo	Come on , Nancy . Play it cool . I go with you and burn the middle night oil tonight .
__label__noemo	Yeah , get off the bus .
__label__noemo	No , probably not . For the first two weeks you may teach 10 or 15 hours .
__label__noemo	Have you had any experience with computer ?
__label__joy	The performance is excellent .
__label__noemo	When will the lecture begin ?
__label__joy	Thank you . Can I meet my colleagues ?
__label__noemo	Beijing Library .
__label__noemo	He ran four miles and came back dead beat .
__label__noemo	Today I'm here to find out about paying in foreign currency . You do that here , I suppose ?
__label__noemo	No , thank you .
__label__noemo	Hi . I'm shopping for my boyfriend's birthday . Do you have any suggestions ?
__label__joy	That sounds ideal . Can we go to have a look at it ? we'd like to see it before making a final decision .
__label__noemo	Here is your valuable . Is that right ?
__label__noemo	What's your last word as to the date then ?
__label__noemo	It's too small for me to wear .
__label__noemo	Can we meet each other half way ?
__label__noemo	Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
__label__noemo	How about adding some pictures of our products for the introduction ?
__label__noemo	In that case , how about a limo ? Then you can travel in style .
__label__noemo	I don't have it .
__label__noemo	The radio says it'll be fine .
__label__noemo	I believe she was right . You must know that fried foods contain a lot of fat .
__label__noemo	Yeah . But I think I'd prefer ...
__label__noemo	Eight hundred yuan .
__label__joy	I'll pick you up at about nine o'clock , will it do ?
__label__noemo	A single one with a private bath .
__label__noemo	Sure , where would you like to go ?

__label__noemo	Good morning , I would like to reserve a berth .
__label__joy	Let me see . Yes , they are perfectly matched !
__label__noemo	I would like to have this laundry done .
__label__joy	That sounds like a good idea . I'll have to try that .
__label__noemo	We could hire a car and travel around the interior of Australia for several days . If we hire a car , we can go where we like .
__label__joy	How about climbing up the Fragrant Mountain tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	Why not go to see the doctor ?
__label__noemo	I ’ ll leave at ten o ’ clock .
__label__noemo	Nothing really , why , what ' s up ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it is .
__label__noemo	Well , easily , It doesn't work . It doesn't even start probably .
__label__noemo	I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature .
__label__noemo	I've been told you might have a vacant room .
__label__noemo	Yes I know . I have to do it every week . Anyway , are you ready to go ?
__label__noemo	Then how about the expenses during the trips ?
__label__noemo	About 2 o ’ clock .
__label__noemo	it's got to be almost a year now .
__label__noemo	Good morning , sir . Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Well , he is , but he can be conniving at times .
__label__noemo	Oh , we need an umbrella . The weather is so changeable in that area .
__label__noemo	not really . I wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . Do you want to go with me ?
__label__noemo	A brand new taxi is pulling up now .
__label__noemo	Yes , there is one at 8: 30 a . m . That arrives at 11:35 a . m .
__label__noemo	the area can be a bit rough in the evenings , but the neighbors watch out for each other , so it ’ s ok .
__label__surprise	Hi , Lin Tao . I have't seen you for some time .
__label__noemo	Okay ! What do you suggest ?
__label__noemo	May I ask what the core value of the company is ?
__label__noemo	You are welcome !
__label__surprise	Oops ! It's the landlord . I guess the tables have turned now . We're the noisy neighbors . Turn it down !
__label__noemo	Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .
__label__noemo	Do you think that will be enough to make him have a change of heart ?
__label__noemo	So , would you make gay marriage legal ?
__label__noemo	How often do you service the pump ?
__label__joy	Mandy , Would you like to come for dinner tonight ?
__label__noemo	Did the police find who did it ?
__label__noemo	How do I do that ?
__label__joy	That ’ s what I can do .
__label__noemo	Am I failing ?
__label__noemo	Can I give you a lift home , Mrs Word ?
__label__noemo	Have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than English ?
__label__noemo	You haven't told me anything yet .
__label__noemo	Swimming . What about you ?
__label__noemo	This is Action 5 News reporter Sarah O ’ Connell reporting live from Washington , D . C . where a protest has broken out . Thousands of angry citizens are protesting against the proposed bailout of the auto manufacturing industry ! Sir , sir , Sarah O ’ Connell , Action 5 news . Can you tell us what ’ happening ?
__label__noemo	if I had enough money , I'd buy one , but I don't even have enough to buy one of their shuffle spods .
__label__noemo	Are there any other packages ?
__label__noemo	Do you remember our first date ? I got a really special gift .
__label__noemo	I import canned food .
__label__noemo	I am so sorry about that . It was just a slip of the tongue .
__label__noemo	I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there ’ s something wrong with the fax machine .
__label__noemo	Are there pets allowed in this apartment ?
__label__noemo	When were you Bron may I ask ?
__label__noemo	Yes , maybe I should have another try .
__label__noemo	There aren't enough buses in this city , are there ?
__label__noemo	I will start my work at the beginning of next month .
__label__noemo	Yes , they are the latest designs . Would you like to try them on ?
__label__noemo	Thanks !
__label__noemo	What would you like to ask me ?
__label__noemo	Can we have two adjoining double rooms , sir ?
__label__noemo	419 yuan .
__label__sadness	My parents are always saying I am not good enough .
__label__noemo	Of course , here you are , sir .
__label__joy	My feelings exactly .
__label__noemo	when you buy clothes , you must think about the material , quality and price .
__label__noemo	Okay , I ’ ll take this one.Does it come with batteries and a case ?
__label__noemo	Yes . But I'm not used to eating American-style breakfast .
__label__noemo	I think I will try to get the scholarship since I really don't have so much money to study abroad . Actually now I am preparing for the TEFL and GRE exams . If I can get high marks in the two exams and if I am lucky enough , I may get a scholarship .
__label__noemo	Yuck . The carrots taste awful and salty . Hi sis , how do you like them ?
__label__noemo	I guess this is a good excuse to surf the Net on someone else's dime .
__label__noemo	Sorry , it's not available now.Anything else ?
__label__noemo	I watched the screen display !
__label__noemo	I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done .
__label__noemo	Brian , do you know how to speak English ?
__label__noemo	Listen , I really don't know why you're making this into such a big issue . It's only a small piece of garbage in a large space . It's not like there's garbage everywhere . Besides , someone will come along to clean it up at some time or another .
__label__noemo	Please , you write much better than I do .
__label__noemo	Do you wash clothes here often ?
__label__noemo	I was worried you would think it was too far to drive .
__label__noemo	Ah , ah , you promised , and remember ?
__label__noemo	I just work there .
__label__noemo	Who's that ?
__label__noemo	If I'm awake .
__label__noemo	Merry Christmas !
__label__noemo	I can't decide whether to go to university or to get a job .
__label__noemo	You can talk with him .
__label__noemo	Oh I don't know . Titanic ?
__label__noemo	Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .
__label__noemo	Definitely pre-med . What about you ?
__label__noemo	Yes , yes . I've got all of that here .
__label__joy	Oh , honey . You came . I'm so glad ! Why are you wearing a bonnet ?
__label__noemo	that's too bad . I'm sure there's a logical explanation for it . Don't be too upset about it .
__label__joy	It's a boy .
__label__noemo	No , I am from south California . This is my first real winter .
__label__noemo	I'll meet you at the Gate round about seven .
__label__noemo	Yeah , but it's expensive . Nah , I'm going to YY's .
__label__noemo	I really hope it doesn't get cold .
__label__noemo	Oh Andrea , the Spanish girl ?
__label__noemo	Oh ! I see . I'll have the paperback , please ,
__label__joy	Let me repeat that 626-555-1739 . Okay , sir , we look forward to seeing you in April !

__label__noemo	You don't have to worry about it . We have a one year warranty .
__label__noemo	It's 20 degrees below zero now . It was even colder this morning .
__label__noemo	And what did the program say ?
__label__noemo	I don't understand what you mean .
__label__noemo	Ok , now could you fill out this registration form ?
__label__noemo	it's a job at a recruitment agency .
__label__noemo	Hello , this is 5735647 5 .
__label__noemo	How can we know if we are doing OK during the year ?
__label__noemo	Well , we can still do some window shopping , can't we ?
__label__noemo	They do , but they're a little expensive on certain items .
__label__noemo	Hello . Is there anything I can do for you ?
__label__noemo	Compared to the shortest route , you may pay around 5 Euro more .
__label__noemo	Pretty good . Say , where are you living this semester ?
__label__noemo	There is no way that I can fall asleep right now .
__label__noemo	I got it from the cafeteria .
__label__noemo	That's too bad . What's the earliest flight available ?
__label__noemo	May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Peter , wash your hands first , and then have some dessert .
__label__noemo	Yes , we are .
__label__joy	Bob ! I hear your team won the match .
__label__noemo	No , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace .
__label__noemo	they do . Once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . It's only a two-seater , you know !
__label__noemo	Thanks . Stop here now .
__label__noemo	I need it delivered at 12 .
__label__noemo	Hi , Joe .
__label__noemo	OK ! Our company is very interested in the tender . I am sure that we will do our best to win the bidding in building the factory .

__label__noemo	Wait a moment . Here is $ 10 you paid for duties .
__label__noemo	Why not ?
__label__anger	How many chances have I given you , I've given up on you .
__label__noemo	Yes ! You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol . You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish .
__label__noemo	Well , some of those other guys are not the same kind I'd like to communicate with , but if that's important to you . I'll try to get along with them .
__label__noemo	Another one sold . Do you see anything else you would like ?
__label__noemo	Do you have another card I could try ?
__label__noemo	No , he doesn't . Anyway , his wife found out that he has been two-timing for a long time .
__label__joy	What is it ?
__label__noemo	What should I fill in under the room number ?
__label__anger	Yes , I joined your group of bus tour this morning . You promised the journey will last 3 hours and we will visit 15 sightseeing spots .
__label__noemo	I want a big pan .
__label__noemo	I am not picky on food . Just bring me the day menu .
__label__noemo	I'm not sure yet .
__label__noemo	We can provide you with information that will help you understand what is available . We also provide workshops .
__label__noemo	No , but we ’ Ve got a hurry . It will be the rush hour soon .
__label__noemo	Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society .
__label__noemo	Are you rushing me ?
__label__joy	Sounds interesting !
__label__noemo	Yes . You've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise .
__label__joy	Well , maybe not a Michael Zhang , but better than the average . Person would you like to play again Wednesday ?
__label__noemo	What ? In your cubicle ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I no longer work there . I'm working with a multi-national corporation .
__label__noemo	You will feel much better except for the fact that you might have a little cough .
__label__noemo	You can suck a candy or pinch your nose gently while breathing out . That shall help .
__label__noemo	I already told you that I'm going to do it .
__label__noemo	How do you get along with them ?
__label__noemo	Take it easy . It is all over now . How was it going , anyway ?
__label__noemo	Office hours are nine to five-thirty . One hour for lunch . Do you have any questions ?
__label__noemo	You should strike while the iron is hot .
__label__noemo	Oh , that's simple enough .
__label__joy	Yes , I think the reason is that there is a big lake , and many trees in the Resort .
__label__noemo	Nice to meet you , too . Let me show you around .
__label__noemo	Alps , suppose .
__label__joy	I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ?
__label__noemo	Can I mail it in late ?
__label__noemo	I had been doing quite well . In all subjects , I got excellent scores .
__label__joy	okay , here I go !
__label__noemo	How far away is it ?
__label__joy	Ok , well enjoy the rest of your stay here .
__label__noemo	Well , I would like a glass of warm water .
__label__noemo	Would you be interested in chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ?
__label__noemo	My name is Phil . What's yours ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	I'm not sure , but I think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge .
__label__noemo	What's he like normally ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , that ’ s perfect . What about the subjects for your minor ?

__label__noemo	Which restaurant ?
__label__joy	You have good taste . It is very much in style this year .
__label__noemo	Well , uh ... I ’ m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Do you think we can get to the airport by 8
__label__noemo	I was thinking about applying for the new position .
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__noemo	IBA Bank , Business Banking Department . Ling Ming speaking . How may I help you ?
__label__noemo	The boss is mad at you .
__label__noemo	What would you like to eat ?
__label__noemo	is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets
__label__noemo	I am coming to inquire about the information of the company . When was this company established ?
__label__noemo	I want the new cards to be exactly like this card .
__label__noemo	You ’ Ve god a fever and playing football isn ’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What ’ s that on your arm ?
__label__noemo	I had introduced an advanced product line , which increased the output and lessened the cost .
__label__noemo	there's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have radar h
__label__noemo	Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut .
__label__noemo	I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one .
__label__surprise	Stones ? I know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ?
__label__noemo	What are you going to do now ?

__label__noemo	OK then . Well , 50 Yuan for appetizer , 200 Yuan for dinner and 200 Yuan for wine . Anything else ?
__label__noemo	Have you heard of motor coaching ? It's one of the fastest-growing segments for the travel industry .
__label__noemo	Mr . White , I would like to give you notice that I will be leaving the company . It will be effective at the beginning of the next month .
__label__noemo	That's not the problem I care about . You can decide on my capacity and experience .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__noemo	But if you go to university , you'll still have time for fun .
__label__sadness	Oh , I'm very sorry about that . You can change it for another one if you prefer .
__label__noemo	Does the rate include the cost of gas ?
__label__noemo	It's not the cleaner's responsibility to pick up after lazy people . It's part of your responsibility to make sure that the place is neat for other people . If everyone thought like you , there'd be garbage everywhere ! The cleaners can't be everywhere !
__label__noemo	I see.Do you have anything to declare ?
__label__noemo	It doesn ’ t matter to me .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes . Our windows let plenty of natural light in . They've also got wonderful views of the park behind our house .
__label__noemo	Yes , I believe there are green teas , black teas and scented teas . Any Others ?
__label__noemo	it's pretty simple , Iris . Just keep it in mind that you're what you eat .
__label__noemo	Where do you live now ?
__label__noemo	It's almost Christmas . What are you doing this weekend ?
__label__noemo	interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ?
__label__noemo	I'd like a little sugar , please .
__label__noemo	OK , here they are .
__label__noemo	Right .
__label__noemo	No problem . So how have you been ?
__label__joy	Pretty good . I ’ Ve just had my new poems published .
__label__noemo	Grandpa , this seat is for you , for you are the eldest person here and also it's your birthday today .
__label__joy	Oh , hi again ! Hey , the fruit looks different this time .
__label__noemo	All right . Here's the lease and the check for the deposit .
__label__noemo	Mary , you're going to have to work on your pronunciation .
__label__fear	Hi , Alan . I feel very nervous because I am going to have a job interview next Monday . Could you please give me some suggestions ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s not the same . It ’ s completely different .
__label__noemo	I see . Okay , well let ’ s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
__label__noemo	I will tell you what I can agree to.If you can quote me a price of 6000 dollars , installation included , I can accept .
__label__noemo	Okay , I'll grill some corn then .
__label__noemo	I didn't sleep much last night .
__label__joy	You ’ re right . I ’ m being crazy ! Ok , I ’ m ready , let ’ s do this !
__label__noemo	Someone has to pick up the boss at the airport .
__label__noemo	I ’ m just looking for a nice pillow on Ebay .
__label__noemo	Well , there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing .
__label__noemo	OK , ma'am . Calm down , 15 dollars will do .
__label__noemo	Yes.My face even ached in the icy wind .
__label__joy	Excellent ! We have the finest cashmeres at affordable prices.How about we get you measured ? Let ’ s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . Now , let ’ s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
__label__surprise	I am afraid your diamond bracelet has gone , darling !
__label__noemo	It will be held at the Music Hall .
__label__noemo	Would you like something to eat ?
__label__noemo	No , he didn't tell me about it . Don't feel bad .
__label__noemo	oh , well , perhaps you'd like a cup of coffee or tea instead .
__label__noemo	Do you mind washing my clothes ?
__label__joy	That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for .
__label__noemo	Yes . Like stereos and televisions .
__label__noemo	Professor , do you have a few moments when I could meet with you ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I do . It's ready and waiting in my account .
__label__noemo	Six thirty , tonight .
__label__noemo	How much do you hope to get a month here ?
__label__noemo	Give me a book please , Jane .
__label__noemo	I bet it is always full of cars .
__label__noemo	Well , this is something new . A few of our friends from Europe have also suggested that we participate in joint enterprise with them dealing in some of our goods . We think there are a lot of details to go into .
__label__surprise	Oh , that is a shame . He is really hard working .
__label__noemo	English , math , commercial and legal studies , and accountancy .
__label__surprise	France ? Is he crazy ?
__label__noemo	That's true . I know that there are lots of popular restaurants and coffee shops around there .
__label__noemo	$ 20 .
__label__noemo	They have made it . Will our love last 50 years ?
__label__disgust	I find Beijing Opera is quite a bore .
__label__noemo	I'd like to buy a tie to match this suit .
__label__noemo	I think you will get a big bonus , because you always have high sales .
__label__joy	Yeah , that sounds delicious .
__label__noemo	Could you copy this document for me ?
__label__noemo	Where do we begin ?
__label__noemo	You mean you got working experience , right ?
__label__noemo	I had to mail in an absentee ballot .
__label__noemo	I know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning .
__label__noemo	Please follow the nurse . She ’ ll get you ready .
__label__noemo	That ’ s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .
__label__noemo	Sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me .
__label__sadness	I can not stop coughing , and I can not stop sneezing . I vomited blood last night . Sorry , I am coughing again .
__label__anger	Shit , so crowded !
__label__noemo	What do you expect of the position ?
__label__noemo	Yeah well it ’ s about time ! He ’ s been living with his parents for 40 years !
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	What is your long-range objective ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	My boyfriend hasn ’ t been feeling so well . Maybe he passed it on to me .
__label__noemo	Hey ! What are you doing here ?
__label__joy	Don't mention it .
__label__joy	Julie ’ s friend , Mary . And John will be the best man .
__label__noemo	Nothing special .
__label__noemo	No , it's quite simple . When you get on , just ask the bus driver when to pay the fare and where you want to get off .
__label__noemo	Therefore , I think I'll explore New York some more . But I need to store my bags .
__label__noemo	No , thanks . I've decided to give up smoking .
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__joy	that's be great . The more prepared I am , the better .
__label__noemo	Judging by all the traffic , I'd say we're near the outskirts of the city .
__label__noemo	What's the problem ?
__label__joy	I'm in heaven ! A Whirlpool dryer !
__label__noemo	Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity .
__label__noemo	You ’ re right . Everything is probably going to come to a head tonight . I ’ ll keep you informed .
__label__noemo	Thanks a lot .
__label__noemo	Then we'll have four-jewel soup .
__label__joy	That's great ! Thanks for your support . If any , please remember to call us . I am afraid I have to say goodbye now ! Bye , Mr . James !
__label__noemo	So then I can't use my phone if I'm on the internet ?
__label__anger	This sucks . I hate buying lingerie . Okay , just find something and get out of here . Alright , these are fine . Oh , no , don ’ t come over here , don ’ t come over here .
__label__noemo	That sounds reasonable .
__label__noemo	just after 2 am .
__label__noemo	I'm completely lost . I'm trying to find the way to my daughter's home .
__label__noemo	May I come in ?
__label__joy	The guy always hands the girls in a line . When did he propose ?
__label__sadness	Please forgive me for rushing into your room forgetting to knock at the door .
__label__noemo	Would you like to look at my cousin's car ?
__label__noemo	Peter ? This is Steven from China . I've got the document you want .
__label__noemo	It fits fine . I ’ ll take it . How much is it ?
__label__noemo	Um , ninety-five dollars ?
__label__noemo	It should be under Leslie Smith . The number is 184796 A .
__label__noemo	Here is 50 yuan .
__label__noemo	They'll be there in about an hour .
__label__noemo	Do you know anything about health food ?
__label__noemo	no , I don't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just had to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It ’ s casual , yet sophisticated .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	No , I am not . And I love to meet new people in the chat rooms who share a lot in common with me .
__label__noemo	yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can help one to keep sound physical health .
__label__noemo	Have you thought about going Dutch ?
__label__joy	Fantastic ! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds !
__label__noemo	No .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t worry . I know there are no pennies from heaven . I will work hard .
__label__noemo	maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you .
__label__disgust	What a mess !
__label__noemo	Yeah , it ’ s your turn to drive next week . Don ’ t be late picking me up .
__label__noemo	Not really . Considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market . Besides , I knew you were really looking forward to watching Star Wars on the opening day .
__label__noemo	Can you introduce him to me ?
__label__noemo	Not good . The doctor told him not to smoke again , but it just rolls off him like water off the duck ’ s back !
__label__noemo	How did you start writing ?
__label__joy	That sounds just perfect . I'll talk things over with some colleagues and get back to you . Thank you very much for the information .
__label__noemo	Don't mention it . I lost a bunch of money on it this year . I think it is on the brink of bankruptcy .
__label__noemo	Is there anything cheaper than that ?
__label__noemo	Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others .
__label__noemo	Yes , I agree with you . When I retired I will participate in programs to keep momentally active .
__label__noemo	Yes , he knows I'm coming . Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock .
__label__noemo	This is a precious opportunity for us and our company .
__label__noemo	Let ’ s cross here .
__label__noemo	Nothing but the best from my dad . I like everything about it except for the brakes . They are a bit sticky .
__label__joy	No , that ’ s enough , thank you .
__label__noemo	And there's a little upside-down Dilbert on the underside .
__label__noemo	And you don't feel any pain anywhere else ? In you legs , for example ?
__label__joy	he is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor .
__label__noemo	Does he treat everyone in your department like this ?
__label__noemo	Television is undoubtedly a great invention , but one of the main criticisms of it is that people just aren't selective enough . Lesley , got a television . how do you pick out the sorts ofprogrammes you want to watch ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me , miss . I'm a transit passenger for Flight No . 207 . Can you tell me where to go ?
__label__joy	Not bad , thanks .
__label__surprise	Susan ? What brings you here today ?
__label__noemo	That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
__label__noemo	But you are too slow to follow them .
__label__noemo	Maybe that's why he's so nice !
__label__joy	Thank you !
__label__noemo	Well , if you have no further questions , then we have done .
__label__noemo	Check out this article . It says smoking can lead to lung cancer .
__label__noemo	How much do you have ?
__label__surprise	Really ? What kind of problems ?
__label__joy	I am so happy that he is our new President !
__label__joy	Good .
__label__noemo	I want the one with the highest interest rate .
__label__noemo	Oh , the ink is spilled on the desk .
__label__noemo	How do you get along with your co-workers ?
__label__noemo	Anything else ?
__label__noemo	Do you have any particular type of apartment in mind ?
__label__noemo	It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards .
__label__disgust	And they will yell back at you .
__label__noemo	you shouldn't take it too seriously . It might be a lie .
__label__noemo	I know what you mean , Carol . I ’ Ve had nothing but trouble with it . They say it ’ s supposed to be easy !
__label__noemo	Right . Okay , let me see what I can do . How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ?
__label__noemo	Are these drinks on sale this weekend ?
__label__noemo	It is a small room , just for 4 people .
__label__noemo	Well , there are core courses and electives .
__label__noemo	Hey , Teresa , meet the new neighbors yet ?
__label__noemo	Can we order a mixed drink in this restaurant ?
__label__sadness	I let you down . I'll make it up to you somehow .
__label__joy	try not to let it bother you too much .
__label__noemo	This t . v is only $ 2500 .
__label__noemo	who is he ?
__label__sadness	I feel pity for the old man .
__label__noemo	Oh , Susie . Didn ’ t I tell you over and over again that you wouldn ’ t be able to climb the mountain unless you got enough sleep ?
__label__noemo	Sorry , I can ’ t .
__label__joy	Oh yes . She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended .
__label__surprise	Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy .
__label__noemo	Oh , this way please . What size do you wear ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s beautiful but crowded .
__label__noemo	Well , you ’ re really as out-dated as she is .
__label__noemo	Are you a soccer fan ?
__label__noemo	Oh , wonderful ! How is the weather ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s not bad at all .
__label__noemo	The large size please . Do Have you any writing-paper ?
__label__joy	I would like to watch the Oscars on Tv tonight . How about you ?
__label__noemo	You ’ ll be a mathematician one day .
__label__noemo	A moment , please . I'll check our room availability for these days ... Yes , that's all right.What ' s your name please ?
__label__joy	yeah , I've met her . She's a genius saleswoman !
__label__noemo	Most public schools in the United States are very good , and the majority of students attend the public schools .
__label__noemo	Ted . Oh , and could you give her this document for me ?
__label__noemo	Well , I wonder if you could track an order I placed with you last month . It hasn ’ t arrived yet .
__label__noemo	I was just thinking of going to a movie tonight .
__label__noemo	Please , go right ahead .
__label__noemo	How much is it ?
__label__noemo	Is there any limit ?
__label__noemo	Black Rose .
__label__noemo	The outlook in the future is very positive . Because we have been in this field for hundreds of years and we know how to survive this crisis safely .
__label__anger	But that ’ s not the only thing ... you know , he really doesn ’ t have the best work ethic , I ’ m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients .
__label__noemo	She ’ s in the garden , Jane .
__label__anger	But it is ! Take this morning for example . The subway was so packed this morning , I got totally squished by about a hundred busy commuters on the way to work .
__label__noemo	How is everything ?
__label__noemo	all right . Do you have any questions ?
__label__noemo	May I show you to your room ?
__label__joy	Here's one — the new , beautiful Digital Barbie . This doll is hot !
__label__noemo	Ok . Please arrive at seven forty-five . We can only hold the table until 8,15 .
__label__noemo	Thanks to global warming , it could be hotter than ever !
__label__noemo	Then what's the rent due date ?
__label__noemo	No , thank you . I don't like milk in my coffee . I like black coffee .
__label__noemo	It's boring , right ?
__label__noemo	I can check for you , if you'd like .
__label__noemo	No , we haven't taken such a course , but we have taken a more specialized course for decision making , by the name of Forecasting and Decision-Making .
__label__noemo	You're back already . That sure was quick .
__label__noemo	In that case , let me tell you about some alternatives .
__label__noemo	How many planets are there in the solar system ?
__label__noemo	Oh , no , it was a kind of pop art . I like it but I couldn't do it that well .
__label__joy	Time flies ! One year has already been a history !
__label__noemo	Both rooms on the same card ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much , madam . Here are some samples of our products . Do try them out .
__label__noemo	Good , if you ’ ll excuse me , I ’ ll go over the sheet right now .
__label__noemo	Off campus or on campus ?
__label__noemo	Well , sir , I was just hoping that I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year .
__label__noemo	It is 45 yuan on the meter .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , ma'am , can I help you find anything ?
__label__joy	Gui yuan are lucky , too ! If you eat them , you'll have a very sweet life !
__label__noemo	The Chinese custom is to go to the groom's home-just the opposite .
__label__noemo	That ’ s really a shame . By the way , who will be the bridesmaid ?
__label__noemo	Yes , please . Milk and two sugar .
__label__noemo	I hear that Tom got divorced , and I don ’ t know how he is now .
__label__noemo	You need to fill out this form , please .
__label__noemo	Hilton Hotel . Can I help you ?
__label__joy	Oh yes . She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended .
__label__noemo	You'll soon get accustomed to it . It's not difficult . Well , here's the bus . Fortunately , it's not full .
__label__joy	That's really a good thing . Let's do our part .
__label__noemo	Are you ready to order ?
__label__noemo	Yes.There are trains at seven fifty-nine , nine eighteen , ten thirty-two and eleven fifty-five .
__label__noemo	I take sleeping pills sometimes .
__label__noemo	Let me just park my car in a better position . Alright , miss . Where ’ s the luggage ?
__label__joy	I love you . And I think you ’ re awesome .
__label__noemo	Wouldn't you like something to eat ?
__label__noemo	we ’ ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it .
__label__noemo	Nothing really .
__label__joy	Thank you . Yes , I would .
__label__sadness	I don't know what I'm going to do . I need to find a job . If I don't , I won't be able to stay here next semester .
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__noemo	It was OK . There was a lot of turbulence , though .
__label__noemo	Well , I am a beginner . I ...
__label__noemo	So you should make an appointment in advance with the company for the interview .
__label__noemo	He ’ s a famous American musician .
__label__noemo	Well , you should talk with your son and let him make his own decision .
__label__joy	It's super .
__label__noemo	Can we have two tickets for this evening's film ?
__label__noemo	Do you have a reservation ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I ’ m going to travel around Europe .
__label__noemo	l am afraid there isn't any fancy soap in my room .
__label__noemo	You ’ re welcome .
__label__joy	The players are scrambling to get the ball . Vargas gets to first base and he ’ s still going ! The outfielder throws it to second ! Vargas slides ! He ’ s safe !
__label__joy	Merry Christmas ! Mary !
__label__noemo	I am self-indulgent sometimes .
__label__noemo	Mr . Luo , will you hold the line , please - - - Mr . Luo , there is no Zhang at that number . Will you check the number again , please ?
__label__noemo	Will it take me straight there ?
__label__noemo	There must be about 50 computers in here .
__label__noemo	May I ask why you decided to switch your account to us ?
__label__noemo	All right , Sir .
__label__noemo	Very few , unfortunately .
__label__noemo	The answer is Belle Opaque . It's a Spanish movie , and the title means The Age of Beauty in English .
__label__noemo	Yes , this is a very popular car .
__label__noemo	I see .
__label__noemo	I want a chicken salad .
__label__joy	Don't mention it . You know , we ’ re old friends .
__label__noemo	Why don't you go talk to her ?
__label__noemo	Please drop it at the front desk when you leave the hotel .
__label__noemo	Hello . Capital Hotel . May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Why did you put it off until the last minute ?
__label__noemo	In most schools , they study about nine subjects .
__label__noemo	Oh , come on . I will be back as early as possible .
__label__noemo	How long will you stay there ?
__label__noemo	I wonder if you could help me , I'm looking for a room .
__label__surprise	Oh , really ?
__label__noemo	Hi there ! I am looking for a new car . I have this old Ford Pinto that I would like to trade in .
__label__noemo	See you .
__label__noemo	How would you describe your relationship with our boss ?
__label__noemo	Let's get started . First , select the service you require . That's household bill payment for you . Then we select the type of bill , so that's landline ... here you go . Your bill for this month comes to 87.42 RIB . The money will come out of your account and go straight to the phone company .
__label__noemo	OK . I ’ ll check the lost and found and with the bar manager . We'll do our best to find it .
__label__noemo	Are you a full-time student or do you attend part-time in the evenings ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s right .
__label__noemo	What's the problem ?
__label__noemo	I know . Three dollars for milk .
__label__joy	That sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much for taking your time . I ’ m still deciding . I will call you tomorrow .
__label__noemo	How many payment methods are there ?
__label__noemo	The government has to face a lot of social problems now .
__label__noemo	The interviewers always are interested in what you ask them about their company .
__label__noemo	Waiter , bring me the menu , will you ?
__label__noemo	Surely of course .
__label__noemo	All right.We ' ll take the second row.By the way , how much is it ?
__label__noemo	Please bring me the chicken chops .
__label__noemo	Dad , I have to do my homework .
__label__noemo	Hello , doctor .
__label__noemo	Mr . Johnson ’ s office . Cindy speaking .
__label__noemo	What happened ?
__label__noemo	Can you play baseball with me today ?
__label__noemo	Let's see . Yes , here are your passports back . Did you pack your luggage yourselves ?
__label__noemo	It's wet and rains a lot.But right now it's the golden season to take a tour there . It is fine there almost everyday .
__label__noemo	I hear you jog everyday .
__label__noemo	Hey , look ! They ’ re playing reruns of the 1996 Olympics .
__label__noemo	Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest .
__label__noemo	See ? I told you . It's very hard .
__label__noemo	Obviously , it depends on what I'm cooking , but I'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
__label__noemo	I don't like to keep up with joneses .
__label__noemo	What if it's broken ?
__label__joy	Full of energy and hope .
__label__noemo	Do you hear what happened to Sally ?
__label__noemo	I work in a cubicle too , but I I don ’ t mind it .
__label__noemo	I think I'll redeem , if that's not a problem .
__label__noemo	Yes , 50 Yuan per month .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Would you like to have a shampoo , sir ?
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	How do you do , Miss Chen ? I ’ m Song Mei .
__label__noemo	I ’ m a GS - 15 . That ’ s high on the scale of workers , but even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage .
__label__disgust	This city is full of jerks .
__label__noemo	I want to buy two tickets for tonight's concert .
__label__noemo	I'm not sure . What do you suggest ?
__label__joy	definitely . rich or poor , dogs always love their masters .
__label__noemo	I am keen on a coat on www.dingding.com . But it requires having an online banking account . Is it necessary ?
__label__noemo	You mean half-and-half ?
__label__noemo	Don't you consider it a hard work ?
__label__noemo	If you bring them back with your receipt within seven days , you'll get a full refund . Also , if you need alterations to the pants , just bring them in and we'll do them for free .
__label__noemo	Maybe you should call your post office .
__label__noemo	Sure . Please put your baggage on scale .
__label__noemo	All that's left is a leg . I gave the head to Tim !
__label__joy	Yes , the weather sure is nice today .
__label__noemo	What would you like ?
__label__noemo	That's right . And it's a B that I'll be writing too . Her name is Olga .
__label__joy	Happy Women's Day . I love you forever , Mum .
__label__noemo	What is your stand on gay marriage ?
__label__noemo	Shall we have a rest here ? I am tired out .
__label__joy	How sweet .
__label__noemo	What the hell are you doing now ?
__label__joy	Wonderful .
__label__noemo	This is where we sing ? These booths are so comfortable , I think I could fall asleep !
__label__noemo	Have you thought about the electrician program over there ?
__label__noemo	Oh , it's for my brother . The little boy over there . He is getting a carsickness .
__label__noemo	I have confidence in you . Believe in yourself .
__label__noemo	Yeah , try not to kick or hit the computer !
__label__noemo	Yes . That's right.But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America.At least as far as studying is concerned.Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school .
__label__noemo	Is it washable ?
__label__noemo	Are you even going to go ?
__label__joy	Congratulation . What will you do ?
__label__joy	Wow , Amy , look at that number .
__label__noemo	Yes , I understand what to do .
__label__noemo	What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ?
__label__noemo	It's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift , so I refused it .
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__noemo	Sorry , it ’ s impossible .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Right , if you see the bookshop , you can see the hospital .
__label__joy	I think we should go out more frequently . The natural scenery can do us good .
__label__noemo	the prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask . Would you like me to get one down for you to look at ?
__label__noemo	Ok , I won't keep you then .
__label__joy	Hey daddy ! You look great today . I like your tie ! By the way , I was wondering can I ...
__label__noemo	These two sections need to be re-written , Jerry . The last guy that did this really mixed things up .
__label__noemo	He's busy . He said next week .
__label__noemo	Do you feel better now ?
__label__noemo	Well , it ’ s very comfortable just to drift here .
__label__noemo	He ’ s the superintendent of this building .
__label__noemo	How could have the heart to do that ? She needs warmth and help .
__label__noemo	the maximum is $ 1000 .
__label__noemo	You needn't worry about it . There are many stores at the scenic spots . I'm sure you can get what you want .
__label__noemo	Yeah , it's hard to believe but true .
__label__sadness	Not in a million years !
__label__noemo	I haven't been driving for long — only for a few months .
__label__joy	It deserves it . The film gave us a lot of inspiration .
__label__noemo	Just one . I noticed an item about flextime . Is that a possibility for me ?
__label__noemo	You'll get used to it gradually .
__label__noemo	OK , let me think . The roller coaster looks more fun .
__label__noemo	I don't know .
__label__joy	It was nothing .
__label__noemo	It's one of the highlights of the match .
__label__joy	Oh , it's so quiet here.We have the park to ourselves , only you and me !
__label__noemo	My daughter plans to quit her present job and wants to find another . She says she wants to get a better job with higher pay .
__label__joy	Because I don ’ t think my husband would like it . Thank you for inviting me anyway .
__label__surprise	Really ? I've already opened this one.Say , this is sweater , and it's just what I need to go with my new suit.Thank you ever so much .
__label__noemo	I am also calm under pressure and trained in first aid .
__label__noemo	No , no limit . You can take as many as you want .
__label__noemo	Jennifer , there ’ s something I wanna ask you .
__label__noemo	Well , it's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it's ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so .
__label__noemo	July , 2006 .
__label__noemo	That's true .
__label__noemo	How can you finance your education abroad ? It is very expensive to study abroad .
__label__surprise	A coffee grinder ?
__label__noemo	Sure , you'll be dancing with lions . What do you expect ? Then what about Range Dance which we did before .
__label__surprise	seriously ?
__label__noemo	But people keep talking about the benefits from the plan .
__label__noemo	John , why don ’ t you go and do some gardening ? The lawn needs weeding .
__label__noemo	Good . You'll feel better after you do .
__label__noemo	I ’ m catching the nine fifteen train tomorrow morning .
__label__noemo	Yeah , you never look at the positive side of things .
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	Great . My family came to visit me .
__label__joy	Yes . It says it will be sunny all day . No sign of rain at all .
__label__noemo	Okay , let's go see a movie .
__label__surprise	Are you crazy ? The papers make everybody listless . I don't think you are the exception
__label__noemo	You ’ Ve been a sales manager for three years . How do you like the job ?
__label__noemo	You ’ re absolutely right .
__label__noemo	OK . I'm coming .
__label__noemo	I ’ m looking for a sweater for my wife . Tomorrow is her birthday . And I know she needs a woolen sweater .
__label__joy	Thanks.You too !
__label__noemo	Yes . How much do you charge for it ?
__label__noemo	You should have been at home and enjoyed a big meal .
__label__noemo	Will this do ? Your major is not related to banking , as you know .
__label__noemo	Yes . The porter will go and help you .
__label__noemo	Are you a daytime student or do you just come in the evenings ?
__label__noemo	Let me see if I can find one of these classes on another day .
__label__noemo	Sorry.We ' Ve nothing further back .
__label__joy	Wow , that would be something to look forward to .
__label__noemo	We should make it , if there isn't too much traffic .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes , how's it ?
__label__noemo	You should change to the No . 701 bus at the next stop .
__label__noemo	Maybe you're right , but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day !
__label__noemo	I need help preparing for my presentation on Friday .
__label__noemo	Mum , can I finish my homework later ?
__label__noemo	yes . One bedroom is for my wife and i . there ’ s another for our daughter . My wife wants to use the third one as a guest room , but I ’ d like to make it into a study . Our daughter is also keen on
__label__noemo	I haven't got much .
__label__noemo	Probably not . Some medicine we need is ethical drug which you can't buy without a prescription .
__label__noemo	I see .
__label__noemo	It's London , 9981-6432 .
__label__joy	Good evening , Saliva . What's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen ? What are you doing now ?
__label__noemo	See you .
__label__joy	Yes , it's to my liking , too .
__label__joy	I know life is not all roses , and I believe I will pull this through .
__label__noemo	is there a penalty for having an overdraft ?
__label__noemo	Is it raining right now ?
__label__noemo	The Grand Hotel .
__label__noemo	I guess you'll read the fine print next time , won't you !
__label__noemo	The chicken tastes wonderful , but it is kind of dry . Is your fish OK ?
__label__joy	Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures .
__label__noemo	Thanks for the warning .
__label__noemo	No , I am from south California . This is my first real winter .
__label__noemo	I thought you said this was easy .
__label__noemo	That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me .
__label__noemo	Yes.Tell him Mr.Cook called and ask him to return my call soon as he gets back .
__label__noemo	What food do you fancy ?
__label__noemo	This is room eleven-seven and my name is Terry Chen .
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome .
__label__noemo	Yes , I found it again .
__label__noemo	Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes would do no good .
__label__anger	Well you can ’ t just take the money . You have to ask the bank for money . And I ’ m the banker .
__label__noemo	Thanks , doc . I ’ Ve got a really bad toothache ! I can ’ t eat anything , and look , my face is all swollen . I think it might be my wisdom tooth .
__label__noemo	What kind of movies do you like , Sue ?
__label__joy	Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already .
__label__noemo	Does the room have an Internet connection ?
__label__noemo	My wife , my daughter and I .
__label__noemo	You know ... like , say God is the creator of the universe , the Bible , and Jesus Christ ...
__label__noemo	Would you like these supplies delivered or would you like to pick them up ?
__label__noemo	How come it is slow as a snail today ?
__label__noemo	Follow me and I will lead you to your seat .
__label__noemo	Do I have to send one by e-mail ?
__label__noemo	Is that right ?
__label__joy	Well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . It was a magnificent sight .
__label__joy	We are happy that we have established business relations . I really hope that we'll have more business to do and more opportunities to meet each other .
__label__noemo	But he still does not come back .
__label__noemo	The European union has sent several plants with relief supplies . Several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies . Refugee camps have been set up across the region .
__label__noemo	It's a drama called Soul Food . This channel is BET-Black Entertainment Television . It has black shows , news and commercials .
__label__joy	maybe because they think they know everything already ! ha ha .
__label__noemo	What else do you want to know ?
__label__noemo	Oh , just for a position as a gas station attendant . You know , starting at a simple lowly job , just like all the greats before they made it big in the world .
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve being kind of been having problems being out of breath . Can you look at that ?
__label__noemo	Because he takes after you , he's got into trouble again .
__label__noemo	You ’ re fine with that ?
__label__noemo	Is it Wangfujing ?
__label__noemo	Sure . Here is the mirror .
__label__noemo	Yes , they all stop at this corner .
__label__noemo	If you are satisfied with the conditions here , please sign this contract and give it to me .
__label__noemo	Okay , let me make sure I got that
__label__noemo	I will try my best to make a good impression , but it is always easier said that done .
__label__noemo	The hours and limitations are printed on the card and this handout .
__label__noemo	Likewise . See you later .
__label__noemo	I think you ’ re right !
__label__noemo	I think you'd better take the No . 16 bus . It can take you right there .
__label__noemo	Well , could you drive me home ? I have spare keys there .
__label__noemo	Oh , do you enjoy it ?
__label__noemo	Thank you . Could you show us to our table now ?
__label__noemo	I turned down quite a few offers before for her sake . But I ’ m a senior now , I don ’ t want to miss the chance this time .
__label__noemo	Four is an unlucky number here , Peter.Four sounds like death in Chinese.Hotels often have no fourth floor .
__label__noemo	This bus ride is taking forever .
__label__joy	Very good . Now , if you will accompany me , we can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts .
__label__fear	I use those sites . Hey ! Let's go check out a flea market later .
__label__noemo	What the magic ward to say if you want something good to happen ?
__label__noemo	Both kinds of food are becoming popular.Nowadays , it ’ s very easy to pick up the ingredients at the supermarket .
__label__joy	Nice meeting you , too .
__label__noemo	I have a business appointment with him for tomorrow morning at ten o'clock , but I'm afraid I can't make it .
__label__noemo	Great . By the way , what does your friend do ?
__label__joy	Glad to meet you . This way , please .
__label__noemo	Did you ever take History 231 ?
__label__noemo	Yes , Sir . That's correct .
__label__noemo	I graduated and now want to get a BA .
__label__noemo	No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy
__label__noemo	I like the apartment , but I see something wrong with it .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Hello , come in , I've been waiting for you .
__label__noemo	That's too bad . Can I take another train ?
__label__anger	I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts !
__label__noemo	It depends . In some poor , underdeveloped areas , children's education is a problem . Many kids cannot afford to go to school .
__label__joy	What a beautiful view .
__label__noemo	It's an undergraduate scholarship offered by the American Minority Students Scholarship Association . I'm eligible for it because I'm Asian American .
__label__noemo	Just focus on us and press the button .
__label__noemo	I have one . We could share it . Which way are you going ?
__label__noemo	Maybe so , but do you have any idea how much this one is worth ?
__label__noemo	But what can you do ?
__label__noemo	And do you like English food ?
__label__joy	Seems like it .
__label__noemo	That's a nice round figure to deal with ! OK , if you were to buy this insurance policy , your yearly fixed income from it would be 94.35 RIB .
__label__noemo	Who do you mean ?
__label__noemo	This situation isn't easy to handle .
__label__noemo	OK , enjoy yourself , sir .
__label__noemo	Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them .
__label__noemo	But considering the fine craftsmanship it is worth much more .
__label__noemo	Howdy ! Nice car ! What seems to be the problem ?
__label__noemo	Okay . I could go for that . It ’ s called Al ’ s Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill 1 your plate as often as you like .
__label__noemo	It certainly was ! So , what are you going to do with your windfall ?
__label__noemo	I'm afraid I can't . I have a dinner party at seven tonight . You see , I am going to England the day after tomorrow .
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry sir , but you can ’ t take any of this into the country . We will also have to check your carry-on . Please step this way . Don ’ t ’ be nervous ; we ’ ll just look through it briefly and then
__label__noemo	Of course yes .
__label__joy	Thank you.Steven.That was the most magnificent meal I've had abroad.You ' ll have to let me reciprocate the next time you're in Beijing .
__label__noemo	I wish I could stay there , but unfortunately it will have to be a round trip ticket .
__label__noemo	Do you think it looks good on me ?
__label__noemo	I really have to get to Paris by this evening.Would you please try to find any other available flight ?
__label__noemo	I really need to find a parking spot .
__label__noemo	For example ?
__label__noemo	For one thing , sir , the quality of the image is usually better.That ' s because it's digital .
__label__noemo	So this is a family business .
__label__noemo	No , I didn't . How high is the tax ?
__label__noemo	Sure . Go straight ahead and you'll walk into it .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__noemo	Certainly .
__label__noemo	That's okay . I'm here a little early . Is it possible to check in right now ?
__label__noemo	Go ahead . It's for your reference . While you are at it , make me a special agenda and don't forget to have enough room at the side for notes .
__label__noemo	Well , yes . Actually , I'm going back to visit .
__label__noemo	So you'll have a tour of the famous city .
__label__noemo	Froth ?
__label__noemo	Wow ... She sounds like a high maintenance wife .
__label__joy	Sure , but you really did great and outperformed the others . You deserved it !
__label__noemo	Do you have a VIP room ?
__label__noemo	Yes , well you haven ’ t had one for ... five years . You should have one every year .
__label__noemo	No . Have a seat .
__label__noemo	Yes . I like winter .
__label__joy	No problem . Just give us a few minutes more to pull them up , though . We don ’ t get that many English singers !
__label__noemo	I will be there for three years .
__label__noemo	Hi , Basil .
__label__noemo	I can terminate my life insurance policy when I retire and use the money as a pension .
__label__noemo	I work as an accountant for a Romanian telecommunications company .
__label__noemo	Not much , I have a car .
__label__noemo	We can try to lower our cost of production then . We need a price that we can compete with , something comparable with the competition .
__label__joy	Anytime . You can reach me at 5558929 .
__label__noemo	How do you feel ?
__label__noemo	If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company .
__label__noemo	Follow me . All the things you need as a woman are in aisles 10 and 11 . This section is usually near the medicine section in any supermarket .
__label__noemo	How can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Cats chase mice , don't they ?
__label__joy	Hi , happy new year !
__label__joy	I'd be happy to do something new .
__label__noemo	What finance experience have you had that qualifies you for this position ?
__label__noemo	Confirmed . Thank you for using our bank ! Please remove your card from the slot . Goodbye !
__label__joy	Absolutely ! Bob and his whole family are welcome here any time !
__label__noemo	Yes , I really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school .
__label__noemo	Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
__label__noemo	I wrote out a check for $ 100 and it bounced .
__label__noemo	How do I tell the difference between a ripe one and an unripe one ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , it was a good Christmas . It won ’ t always be this good , but we can ’ t make it last longer than it should .
__label__joy	Ah hah.Thought you were't drinking .
__label__noemo	Ok . Where shall I pay duty for it ?
__label__noemo	Pretty good . What brings you here ?
__label__joy	Wow , I didn ’ t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
__label__noemo	Well , in that case , there is nothing more to be said . What's your last word as to the date then ?
__label__noemo	In such a big family , there must be a head . Who's the head of your family ?
__label__joy	Well , it is very beautiful .
__label__noemo	Do you need any other documentation from me ?
__label__joy	I am glad you are happy .
__label__noemo	Sure . What is it ?
__label__noemo	20/350 .
__label__noemo	Yes , but this will be my first time voting .
__label__noemo	How many people are there in your family ?
__label__noemo	if you know any of their friends . You can ’ t rely on your friends to introduce people to you all the time . You have to go out and make the first move sometimes . I also like funny people .
__label__noemo	And then I just sign here ? You're right ! It certainly is simple and extremely convenient .
__label__noemo	Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ?
__label__joy	It's my pleasure .
__label__noemo	That ’ s true . many people from the south don ’ t like the whether here .
__label__noemo	Can I see your passbook and the withdrawal slip , please ?
__label__noemo	Have you checked the database ?
__label__noemo	Will you be voting ?
__label__noemo	It's out in the suburbs .
__label__anger	Because I'm no sucker ; only suckers go to the end of the line . It's as simple as that , lady .
__label__noemo	Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow ? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
__label__noemo	That sounds good . Where do you want to play ?
__label__noemo	Sometimes , but not quite often .
__label__noemo	How about the hiking ? It was freezing yesterday , are you all ok ?
__label__noemo	I have an ACRE certificate , GRADE 2 .
__label__noemo	What are the side effects of this medication ?
__label__noemo	I'm perfect with my clothes . And I do not have anything else with me .
__label__noemo	I see . It is the position desired
__label__noemo	I don ’ t know anything about it . Soccer isn ’ t as popular in my country as it is here .
__label__noemo	Do you have a history of stomach pain ?
__label__noemo	I wouldn't mind getting some Chinese food .
__label__surprise	You're kidding . We'll never make it across in one piece ! Let's cross at the light .
__label__noemo	All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ’ s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole !
__label__noemo	I hate to disappoint you , but unlike what most people think , we aren't all exactly the same !
__label__noemo	I've heard that the Ideal Life School is famous . They offer many programs and there are many classes available . The charge is also fair .
__label__noemo	See that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .
__label__noemo	My mother woke me up . She had heard me crying out for help .
__label__noemo	That's the last time I get on a bus with you .
__label__noemo	There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh.Chinese is no problem for Apple .
__label__noemo	Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ?
__label__noemo	I have chosen 15 candidates . The first round interview is tomorrow .
__label__joy	I decided to give it a go !
__label__noemo	Help you in the kitchen , I don ’ t feel like it .
__label__joy	Happy birthday , Jim !
__label__noemo	When do you expect him back ?
__label__noemo	My work involves various routine bookkeeping and basic accounting tasks including journal entries , verifying data and reconciling discrepancies , preparing detailed reports from raw data , and checking accounting documents for completeness , mathematical accuracy and consistency .
__label__noemo	I have to see my daughter .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'll have a boiled egg with toast and orange juice , please .
__label__noemo	What do you think of the traffic today ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I felt exactly the same way as you did just now . Scientists must be crazy in saying so .
__label__surprise	you've got to see it . It's an unbelievable picture !
__label__noemo	Is there a sofa in the living room ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I'd like to get some gas .
__label__noemo	Don't worry about it .
__label__noemo	Said , and done . Will there be anything else ?
__label__noemo	Here you are , officer .
__label__joy	Oh , I see them . Beautiful weather should be shared by all the people .
__label__noemo	Yes.Let ' s start today .
__label__noemo	OK , what does that entail ?
__label__joy	Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ?
__label__noemo	True , you are getting a really pot belly , aren't you ?
__label__noemo	I could stand to lose a few pounds . Having a car has made me lazy . I never end up walking anywhere !
__label__noemo	I started at PCC .
__label__noemo	Can I have a look at that digital camera please ?
__label__noemo	I really like what you have . But the price for this product is much higher than we expected . I am absolutely not a buyer at that price .
__label__noemo	It ’ s blond .
__label__noemo	And what would you like to have for the main course
__label__noemo	I'd like to go around the city , if you don't mind .
__label__noemo	You get off on Del Mar and Hill .
__label__noemo	Let's stop at the newsagent , I would like to buy a newspaper . We can also buy postcards for your friends .
__label__noemo	I just went to bed .
__label__noemo	I have studied carefully the information about your company on the internet and I have checked your company ’ s homepage . I am impressed by the company . And I like the products a lot . Since you ’ re growing steadily , I would be very eager to help you to improve your accounting system .
__label__noemo	$ 10 .
__label__noemo	Thanks . See you .
__label__noemo	Yes , but it must be treated in an effluent treatment plant first .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll give him a call .
__label__noemo	No , not really ... I ’ m completely at a loss .
__label__noemo	that ’ s unless there is a traffic jam . It could take three hours .
__label__noemo	And which child is this ?
__label__noemo	Hello , back already ? That was quick !
__label__joy	actually , I was happy just to get the book published . Winning the prize was an added bonus .
__label__noemo	Alright . I'll have another drink .
__label__noemo	Sure . We have one on the second floor .
__label__noemo	Does this bus really go to the mall ?
__label__noemo	A bit of both . Some cousins , aunts and uncles will be there , but also some friends from the neighborhood .
__label__noemo	Right , a ballpark figure is fine , and slant it a little high if you have to .
__label__noemo	Oh , so you're a teacher .
__label__noemo	Good morning , Room Service . May I help you ?
__label__noemo	"Do you know when people began to sing the song "" Happy Birthday "" ?"
__label__noemo	We shouldn't have any trouble if we don't get stuck in the traffic jam .
__label__noemo	$ 60.The price is reasonable for its large quantity . What's more , there are some gifts attaching for you .
__label__noemo	About half a year .
__label__joy	Let's enter it !
__label__noemo	Perhaps she makes about 25 knots an hour .
__label__noemo	I have a taste for something sweet .
__label__noemo	The beauty under the tree ?
__label__noemo	Do you think what I did to Elvin was out of line ?
__label__noemo	We directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50 % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received .
__label__noemo	Why don ’ t you try then ? Even if it doesn ’ t help you find an American girl , you could still have a stronger and healthier body . You won ’ t lose anything by doing that .
__label__joy	This is very beautiful . Though I have to confess , I don ’ t know the first thing about farming !
__label__joy	Good ! I'm interested in your advice .
__label__noemo	I thought homecoming was a high school dance .
__label__noemo	I think so , too .
__label__surprise	You should know that already .
__label__noemo	Madam I ’ m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency .
__label__joy	Now that's an exciting job ! ! !
__label__noemo	Through this course , I can learn more about the world around us clearly .
__label__noemo	No , thanks ; I'm fine .
__label__noemo	Yes , sir . You're going to have a great time .
__label__noemo	Yeah , where is yours ?
__label__noemo	He must be regretting about having done the business .
__label__noemo	Hello , Marsha , I haven't heard from you in a long time . I'm great , and you ?
__label__noemo	We had seven , but we sold one this morning .
__label__joy	Then you will be happy to here that today all our pizzas are on sale . Two for one .
__label__noemo	Do you have any brothers or sisters ?
__label__noemo	In response to your offer , the sellers have decided to counter-offer three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__fear	I turned on my laptop and it broke ! I mean , the monitor went black !
__label__noemo	No problem . Pick me up something to eat too , please .
__label__joy	I didn ’ t , but I applied for an apprenticeship , and since I studied math , AND I have a good attitude 4 , my application was accepted .
__label__noemo	Yes , you are right .
__label__joy	The help is mutual . I must thank you to see me off . My wife and I will be looking forward to seeing you . You will come to see us , won't you ?
__label__noemo	Hurry up ! Time is money !
__label__noemo	Morning , Meg . You look not well today ? Are you ill ?
__label__noemo	My internet is having problems connecting .
__label__noemo	It's only like that the first couple of times .
__label__noemo	Actually , my office is right around the corner .
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . What other languages can you speak ?
__label__noemo	Where are you living now ?
__label__noemo	What about tomorrow morning at 9 ? I'll come over to your hotel .
__label__joy	Sounds cool ! But that is not what a lady should do . People are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk .
__label__noemo	I see . Yes , you'll need to renew your passport in a few months . Make sure you don't let it expire while you are in the UK .
__label__noemo	Is that everything ?
__label__noemo	I come from America . Are you a freshman ?
__label__noemo	Hi , Sue . What's up ?
__label__surprise	That's a lot of money !
__label__joy	Perfect . Couldn't be better .
__label__noemo	She ’ s my friend ’ s ten-year-old niece . I guess there won ’ t be another wedding in this family for a long time .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , I'm looking for a good novel . Can you recommend anything ?
__label__noemo	I know . I know . But I don ’ t want any worms .
__label__noemo	Right . Here is our sales catalog and literature .
__label__noemo	So your room number is 201 . Are you a member of our hotel ?
__label__noemo	She has blond hair and blue eyes .
__label__surprise	A trip to China for summer vacation . Wow ! What a wonderful surprise ! Thank you . This is the best surprise I've ever had .
__label__noemo	Ours are for everyone that graduated in the same year .
__label__noemo	I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ?
__label__noemo	Why ? to welcome the new year of course .
__label__joy	The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ’ s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful .
__label__noemo	Hello , John . How are you ?
__label__noemo	Which team do you back then ?
__label__noemo	I don't think the meet will go on much longer , should I ask him to call you when he is free .
__label__disgust	Yeah . We ’ re never going to get to the end of this one .
__label__noemo	This area here is where we keep our raw materials . The main production area - our machine hall - is situated next to it . Maintenance is situated between the stores and the production area . Just to the right of Maintenance , there are steps up to the Lab and the Admin Section . Process Control is also on the upper level . It's located above the factory floor so that the operators can monitor everything that is going on below .
__label__noemo	Playground . We're having sports for today's outside class activities . All my classmates have already got there .
__label__sadness	It's leap my mind . I really feel terrible about it .
__label__noemo	It is free on weekend .
__label__noemo	I heard that Kevin got divorced . Is that true ?
__label__anger	The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart .
__label__noemo	It ’ s okay sir , calm down . What happened ?
__label__noemo	Is that why you wear second-hand clothes as well ? Because they've got character ?
__label__joy	Thank you ! I am glad to hear that . When would it be convenient for me to start working ?
__label__noemo	well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Cuizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies .
__label__noemo	Yes , but I couldn't help it . I was late getting off work for a start , and then I missed the bus . The bus I did catch got caught in a traffic jam . It was one thing after another .
__label__noemo	Let me see a doctor .
__label__joy	Hey ! What's that smell ? Are you burning the toast ?
__label__noemo	I will feel better when I know what the problem is . Thank you for the drugs .
__label__joy	That's a nice discount .
__label__joy	Do you like it ? It's Irish music .
__label__noemo	This model features anti-lock brakes , airbags on both driver and passenger sides , and impact collision design . But that's not all . This car isn't only safe but it's also very economical .
__label__noemo	I usually have cereal for breakfast .
__label__noemo	That's right . You have learned a lot , haven't you ?
__label__noemo	Can you give me a special offer ?
__label__noemo	What about the interior ?
__label__noemo	If I do a few exercises at home , like crunches , I'll soon deal with this waistline .
__label__noemo	No , thank you . Check , please .
__label__noemo	Your oil is fine but your tires are a little flat .
__label__noemo	Yeah , me too . Did you hear about Ted ?
__label__noemo	Please go to the tables over there for cold dishes and vegetables . The hot dishes are on the other side .
__label__noemo	How long does it take to get here from your home ?
__label__noemo	Thanks .
__label__noemo	Hello Mr Fang ! It's good to see you again . What can we do for you today ?
__label__noemo	Julia , what's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
__label__joy	Can I bring my camera with me ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s not true . Dark Angel is a good show .
__label__noemo	Actually , I'm calling to complain about your service . The computer I bought last week is faulty .
__label__noemo	Just having a chat .
__label__noemo	Then what ? Your plane was three hours late !
__label__noemo	I'm concerned about the possible jolting , squeezing and collision that may take place when these cases are moved about .
__label__noemo	That seems reasonable . We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square .
__label__noemo	Anything else ?
__label__noemo	There's a service called ' A friend in New York ' . It's a personal tour guide service .
__label__noemo	Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company .
__label__noemo	This one ?
__label__noemo	But it's true .
__label__noemo	Yes . I'd like to choose a sweater for my son .
__label__noemo	Okay . Do you have your receipt ?
__label__joy	Hey , that's a really nice outfit you have on .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__noemo	Do people respond well to you ?
__label__noemo	I hid so that it couldn't see me . Slowly it got closer and closer , until ...
__label__noemo	Today is Saturday .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Now I came back to the hotel and try to show it to my friend , the pen is broken , I am afraid .
__label__joy	Don't tease me ! Good food is really important to Chinese !
__label__noemo	Then you may know that it's hard work .
__label__noemo	We scored six goals .
__label__noemo	I need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper .
__label__noemo	Guess where we ended up .
__label__noemo	Not bad.How about you ? Haven't seen you for a long time .
__label__noemo	I'll use my VISA .
__label__joy	Of course , yes.They look nice.And they're not expensive .
__label__noemo	Right . By the mid - 50 ' s , this light-hearted genre was competing with films about more serious subjects . There was one kind that could be found throughout all of these years , and that was the , mm , the . . .
__label__noemo	I feel it is OK and I want to give it a try .
__label__noemo	Yes , we have both the paperback and hardcover . which would you want to buy ?
__label__noemo	It's interesting . Let me see .
__label__noemo	Where's Wort Street , please ?
__label__noemo	No kidding ! When the last CEO left , we were worried about the future of the company .
__label__noemo	There are so many eating utensils on the table . Which ones do I use first ?
__label__noemo	Hello everyone , and welcome to our CPR for beginners course . First of all , does anyone know what CPR stands for ?
__label__noemo	We'll have to discuss the problem later .
__label__noemo	Really ? Why we must have warm and fresh water ?
__label__anger	I know why Mr . Fro didn't like our ad idea ! He doesn't know the first thing about coffee .
__label__joy	Yeah , you too !
__label__noemo	I bought it from the Macy's at the Santa Anita mall .
__label__noemo	It ’ s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy .
__label__noemo	Yes , he was 29 then .
__label__noemo	Don't worry , nothings going to happen . I'll be there real soon .
__label__noemo	How far do you want me to go ?
__label__fear	I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .
__label__noemo	I ’ d like to apply for a secretarial position .
__label__noemo	Just tell him I'll call him when I get back from Australia . That's it .
__label__joy	Don ’ t worry . I'll buy a new necklace as same as the old one .
__label__noemo	I need to return a book .
__label__noemo	Small size .
__label__joy	We are nor alone here . So many other families !
__label__noemo	Is there a Post Office sign on the building ?
__label__joy	If you have any question , you can ask me .
__label__joy	What a great weekend that was !
__label__noemo	Can you start on Monday ?
__label__noemo	' Romeo and Juliet ' .
__label__noemo	Can you speak English fluently ?
__label__fear	I don ’ t feel sick , ... let me check ... Nope ! No fever , I ’ m fine .
__label__noemo	Could you check my list to see whether I have forgotten anything ?
__label__noemo	Sure . Just a minute . Let me take my camera out .
__label__noemo	Where ?
__label__noemo	Actually , it likes milk too .
__label__joy	That's pretty cool .
__label__noemo	Because I don ’ t think my husband would like it . Thank you for inviting me anyway .
__label__noemo	So how much do you want to gamble ?
__label__noemo	Well , according to your experience , perhaps you could tell me what essential qualities a personnel department office clerk should maintain .
__label__noemo	It ’ s only the day when the world ’ s biggest sporting event is kicking off .
__label__noemo	Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion .
__label__noemo	You've heard of Bruce Jenner , haven't you ?
__label__noemo	The website will give you your results and then tell you what the normal range is .
__label__surprise	Ouch !
__label__noemo	There are such shops living on selling parts . I don ’ t like their service either . All they want is your money . But in the long run , they will be losing costumers . Anyway , car service business is new in China . We all have to control what they are doing . Otherwise , they will not improve .
__label__noemo	All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us .
__label__noemo	I would like to open a checking account .
__label__noemo	"Let me tell you the story.In 1892 , Patty Smith Hill and Mildred Hill wrote a song called "" Good Morning to you "" . But later someone added the words "" Happy Birthday "" to their tune ."
__label__noemo	We have workshops in Resume Writing and Interviewing , to name a few .
__label__noemo	Waiter , please bring me some toast .
__label__noemo	ok , i choose luckies .
__label__joy	All right . That sounds fair .
__label__joy	I ’ ll be ready .
__label__noemo	i mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria . they are likely to cause immune system problems .
__label__noemo	Have you got your e-mail address ?
__label__noemo	Hi Paul . How are you , friend .
__label__noemo	What you're paying for , Ma'am , are the ingredients . It is a very high quality product .
__label__noemo	And what's the purpose of your visit ?
__label__noemo	It has a built-in camera unit that takes digital color stills . It also plays MP3 files , which I can save on media cards and then transfer to the hard drive of my computer .
__label__noemo	Well , it's better than ' Friendship first , competition second ' .
__label__disgust	I'm fed up with his endless talking .
__label__noemo	Yes . Well , I think I'll go get lunch . Will you join me ?
__label__joy	Congratulations ! Mr . Stuart ! You won the city marathon .
__label__noemo	Let me see . It depends .
__label__noemo	Where are you going ?
__label__noemo	Would you mind answering a few personal questions ?
__label__noemo	That's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark .
__label__noemo	Not at all , sir . Here you are .
__label__noemo	Good . Well , Mr . White , most of the items listed are available this year . I hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts soon to enable timely delivery .
__label__joy	Not at all . Bang the door , please .
__label__noemo	There are many new kinds of newspapers . I find it hard to choose among them . Which is the most popular paper circulating in our city ?
__label__noemo	Thank you . How is the light now ?
__label__noemo	How much will it be in Chinese currency ?
__label__noemo	I won ’ t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . There were a few surprises .
__label__noemo	I'd like that .
__label__noemo	I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars .
__label__noemo	I need to use the Internet .
__label__noemo	I can see it . The bus is stopping . I think we will be able to go inside .
__label__noemo	Good afternoon.madam.How can I help you ?
__label__noemo	We will send your doctor the results , and he will contact you .
__label__noemo	It goes to the Gold Line ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry for hero . I dont think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts .
__label__noemo	Let's go .
__label__noemo	Yes , Of course . What's your telephone number ?
__label__noemo	You must show where and when you tried to look for work . If you earned any money , you need to tell them about it .
__label__anger	That's true . You can hear my tummy grumbling . I am really hungry !
__label__noemo	Why not ?
__label__noemo	I usually have cereal , but sometimes I cook a traditional English breakfast .
__label__noemo	I'll tell you what . Your class can rent them from me for the night and buy back any damaged ones .
__label__noemo	Yes . Do you mind ?
__label__noemo	That's the one . It's an actioncomedy . What do you think ?
__label__noemo	Well , I am sure you will .
__label__noemo	That's the most important thing .
__label__noemo	I don't know . Let me look on the rack . Here is one . LARGE . Try it on .
__label__noemo	People say only those that are in love like to read romance stories .
__label__noemo	I beg your pardon ?
__label__noemo	Thirty percent ?
__label__noemo	That's not a problem .
__label__noemo	No , they're giving us discount tickets on a honeymoon package in ...
__label__noemo	Oh , yes , you like skiing .
__label__joy	Yes , you're right . And I was so tired that I fell asleep on the way back . My arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday .
__label__noemo	What's today's date ?
__label__noemo	They are $ 168 .
__label__noemo	Of course not .
__label__noemo	Yes , I am playing on the tennis team this year , and they are requiring me to get a physical exam .
__label__noemo	Sorry , madam . You have to wait your turn . The parking lot is full .
__label__noemo	I would be happy to . Did you find everything you needed ?
__label__noemo	I am diligent and hard-working . Besides , I am good at both English and Italian .
__label__noemo	No . Not necessarily in town . But in southern Wisconsin somewhere . A tornado has been spotted . They have two stages here.This is what is called a tornado watch . That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado .
__label__joy	You're so thoughtful !
__label__noemo	Excuse me !
__label__noemo	oh , they are pancakes , hollowed sesame buns , scallions , cucumbers and oisin sauce . I will show you how to make one .
__label__joy	yes , I did . I won a prize for best local history book at the annual book awards .
__label__noemo	I have checked the weather report . It says it will be cloudy , but no rain .
__label__joy	Thanks , that's very kind of you to say . I hope my necklace goes with my dress , and they both make me look good I feel .
__label__noemo	Tell me a little bit about yourself , please .
__label__joy	Sure , I love looking at photos .
__label__noemo	it's hard to say , but i do love foxtrot and waltz .
__label__noemo	Kind of . It leads to my bedroom .
__label__noemo	Have you been too busy to get enough sleep ?
__label__noemo	They're only three thousand yuan .
__label__noemo	You ’ re welcome .
__label__noemo	Yes , in some sense . I should say I like mountain climbing , you know , because I'm not so professional . How about you
__label__noemo	Fine , thank you .
__label__surprise	My dear , it's five flights up !
__label__noemo	If you go out recently you will find some people riding scooters in high streets and back lanes .
__label__joy	Thanks for coming shopping with me .
__label__noemo	No , have they have another fight ?
__label__noemo	Here's 30 . Keep the change .
__label__joy	Let's go !
__label__noemo	What's the special today ?
__label__noemo	How many stops are there ?
__label__noemo	Good evening , sir .
__label__noemo	How much does this house cost ?
__label__noemo	Certainly . May I have your card , please ?
__label__noemo	Yes , she does . But she's working in Washington , D . C . , right now . Her job is top secret .
__label__noemo	Sure . In the middle part of the fifth street , there is a Phoenix Restaurant . Maybe you can go there .
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__joy	You may put it that way if you like . Don ’ t worry . You ’ ll have no problem .
__label__noemo	The doctor said that I probably have had it a few days .
__label__sadness	I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad .
__label__noemo	I'll have a whole-wheat loaf , three white loaves , a baguette and ten rolls , please . How much is that ?
__label__joy	Will Mary and her husband be ready to leave for their honeymoon ?
__label__noemo	Shall we go for a drive today ?
__label__noemo	Probably nothing .
__label__noemo	When did it first break down ?
__label__joy	God ! Even talking about it makes me feel like l'm gaining weight !
__label__noemo	I help you spot potential problems with the home before you purchase it .
__label__noemo	Welcome , Mr . Foster , if you would have a seat in the lounge area , our hostess will be ready to seat you in just a moment .
__label__noemo	OK , your work experience is impressive , and I think you sound right for this position , but I do have 3 other people to interview , so you'll be hearing from us within a week .
__label__noemo	Both our countries are quite small . How would you describe the landscape in your country ?
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve often wondered the same thing . I also wonder who reads them . Then I realize that I ’ m standing here reading them myself .
__label__noemo	It ’ s mostly on my right side . Right here !
__label__noemo	Well , did you know he was also the director of The Terminator ?
__label__noemo	When do you want it delivered ?
__label__noemo	I went across the street . There is a good Chinese restaurant next to the hotel .
__label__noemo	He's not doing too well .
__label__noemo	My name is Derek Schneider , S - C - H - N - E - I - D - E - R .
__label__noemo	I ’ m going there tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Yeah , so what do you think about the teachers ?
__label__noemo	Uh huh.How about a used car ? They've got good ones now .
__label__sadness	Believe it or not , the company I worked for closed down , so I ’ m out of a job .
__label__noemo	I see . Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	Oh , it's a Polo . It has the logo on the back and at the bottom in the left-hand corner .
__label__noemo	Does your company have a large population ?
__label__noemo	Yes , she leaves it to me .
__label__noemo	Would you like something to drink ?
__label__noemo	This visa is good for two weeks . Do you intend to stay longer than that ?
__label__noemo	I've heard . She looks quite depressed .
__label__noemo	Would you be kind enough to lend me forty pounds ?
__label__noemo	I like to play piano , go bowling and chat with my friends.And you ?
__label__noemo	Yes , you must put yourself on a diet .
__label__noemo	I am on a diet . And I do more exercise regularly .
__label__noemo	Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ?
__label__noemo	These ?
__label__noemo	They are morning glories . They are cute , aren't they ?
__label__noemo	The software of computer is all the programmes inside the computer that allow you to use the computer to do things .
__label__noemo	Please fill in this form . How would you like it ? In 100 Euro cheques ?
__label__noemo	I need at least 75,000 per year .
__label__noemo	Why not ?
__label__joy	It ’ s my pleasure . I enjoyed working with you .
__label__noemo	We can't be too cautious about these things .
__label__noemo	I asked if you come here often .
__label__noemo	That's right .
__label__noemo	Generally speaking , job seekers can enter the websites either of job agencies or of some units for job advertisements .
__label__noemo	Yes , I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them .
__label__noemo	Let me see your ID .
__label__noemo	Ah , thank you.Please bring your luggage here for inspection .
__label__noemo	Thirty minutes in gym at lunch time .
__label__noemo	No , I don't have anything to declare .
__label__noemo	Hi honey ! What ’ s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ?
__label__noemo	I didn ’ t say I ’ d already decided , dad . I said it was for me to decide . There is a difference .
__label__noemo	What is there besides coffee ?
__label__noemo	have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job .
__label__noemo	How long have you been living here ?
__label__noemo	Is there anything I can do for you ?
__label__noemo	Yes , dad ?
__label__sadness	I got sacked today .
__label__joy	Thank you very much . I ’ ll see you the day after tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Six o'clock in the afternoon .
__label__noemo	First of all , you should keep proper posture and make eye contact with the speaker with a smile .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry that I was absent yesterday .
__label__joy	Yes .
__label__noemo	Why don't you change the cash to traveler's checks ? It's much more convenient and safer . When you are abroad , you can cash them .
__label__noemo	But jobs with a lot of overtime are quite limited . Employers usually don't like to pay for overtime if they can manage .
__label__noemo	I can help you there . Those are numbers that cannot be created by multiplying two whole numbers , apart from the number itself and 1 , together .
__label__joy	Daddy , I am so glad you come out with us .
__label__anger	They promised us a sea view .
__label__joy	This one is good .
__label__joy	Here you are . Thank you , bye-bye !
__label__noemo	Of course . The brand is Bird and it's famous for its quality .
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? Give me a clam soup .
__label__noemo	If you feel our proposal is attractive , it is estimated that business to the extent of over twenty million marks can be done in this manner .
__label__noemo	Do you like coffee ?
__label__noemo	Ok . Thank you .
__label__noemo	I'd like to see a tea set , please ?
__label__noemo	It says here that you graduated from Beijing Normal University with a major in English Language and Literature .
__label__noemo	Maybe this is God's will .
__label__noemo	Do you have other questions ?
__label__noemo	Have you been driving buses a long time ?
__label__noemo	How about sick days ?
__label__noemo	Sally , I ’ m tired of this Western food . I really miss my mother ’ s Sichuan cooking .
__label__noemo	Not much . Just sitting here eating some Chinese food . Is that the paper ? Why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope ?
__label__noemo	Is Friday good for you ?
__label__noemo	I'm really not sure .
__label__noemo	30 dollars , Ma'am .
__label__noemo	I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .
__label__joy	Sure , I'd love to .
__label__noemo	I wouldn't recommend it . I think we should wait until she comes round .
__label__noemo	The place is a must-see . This zoo was built in 1862 , and it's the oldest zoo in the world , and still among the best . There are more than 3,000 species of animals here , including the popular kangaroos , wallabies , koalas , and wombats .
__label__noemo	Yeah , let's go together .
__label__joy	It's a deal , Hal . Thanks again for stopping to help . And thanks for smashing my car !
__label__noemo	No , he isn't . He's an engineer , the most famous one in our company .
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__noemo	Jog ?
__label__noemo	What kind of juice do you prefer , sir ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . By the way , how can I get out of the platform after I get off the train ?
__label__noemo	There must be a mistake . Those are fried oysters . Would you like to keep it or change ?
__label__joy	Well done !
__label__noemo	Yes , I have been invited by the East Import & Export Corporation of China for business talks .
__label__noemo	To tell you the truth , a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import . When I open a letter of credit with a bank , I have to pay a deposit . That'll tie up my money and increase my cost .
__label__noemo	and what is your call regarding ?
__label__noemo	Maybe it was , but answer the question .
__label__noemo	It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer .
__label__noemo	Do you have any questions we didn't cover in the interview ?
__label__noemo	What about the car over there ?
__label__joy	Yeah , if something is on the radio it must be really good .
__label__noemo	Is it true that you have a heavy work schedule ?
__label__joy	Oh , i am grateful for my mother on this point . her idea of healthy eating helps me a lot keeping fit .
__label__noemo	Boiled .
__label__joy	That's all tight , Mr.Smith.That ' s my job . I'm very glad he recovered so soon .
__label__noemo	You mean you're going to ask her out in a note ? You big chicken !
__label__noemo	Yeah , there are many English signs , and wrong spellings as many as them .
__label__noemo	You like horror movies ? I don't like them because they're too scary ! I like comedies because I love to laugh .
__label__noemo	On 20th May 1963 .
__label__noemo	It ’ s very interesting actually .
__label__noemo	Sure , wait a moment .
__label__joy	Thank you . He ’ s very lucky indeed .
__label__noemo	But I don ’ t envy those who are filthy with dough . That ’ s not the whole life .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__noemo	Oh . That dress doesn't exactly match the job .
__label__surprise	Why didn't I think of that ?
__label__noemo	Hey , you , pick up that piece of garbage !
__label__noemo	Why , of course . Let's see ... White ... Pale yellow . Here you are , sir .
__label__noemo	How old is she ?
__label__noemo	Very good , sir . What kind would you like ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it is . It's very urgent . I feel awful . I have a terrible toothache .
__label__noemo	Then , I ’ ll see you next week , Ms . O ’ Brian ?
__label__noemo	You could have tried to explain to him about the new programmers .
__label__noemo	Oh , that's very kind of you . Thank you very much . I've got to go .
__label__noemo	How long will it take to get there ?
__label__noemo	Your mp3 looks so cool . Where did you get it ?
__label__sadness	Oh , I ’ m so sorry .
__label__noemo	sure . How many would you like ?
__label__noemo	Definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ?
__label__noemo	I just make eye contact with him and nod my head . Then I tell him when he comes over to the table . Why do you ask ?
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	I quit my job as a food critic .
__label__noemo	She does have a heart of gold .
__label__noemo	Where exactly have you been working , please ?
__label__joy	Hey , Shirley . The party has been wonderful . My husband and my children have enjoyed it very much , and me too .
__label__joy	OK . I like the design of this lamps . I also need some cushion covers . I ’ ll just browse through those ones over there .
__label__noemo	Is that right ?
__label__noemo	Sure . I think filet steak will be a good choice . It's the best local food .
__label__noemo	One of my strengths is my ability to be flexible . I've seen companies go through many changes in structure and management philosophy . I've had to adjust my style to the new environment several times . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But by being aware of my tendency to overwork , I have learned to pace myself more and work less overtime .
__label__noemo	All right . We'll have some seafood and vegetables .
__label__noemo	Thank you for your information .
__label__joy	Are you serious ? That will be wonderful !
__label__noemo	How much does it cost ?
__label__joy	That sounds pretty good .
__label__noemo	Hi . My minibar is empty .
__label__noemo	How about the price of the hardcover ?
__label__surprise	Are you kidding ? You got the leading role .
__label__joy	Okay . I'll do it if you're positive that this is what you want .
__label__joy	Good thing , we took a taxi .
__label__noemo	This was stated in our agreement .
__label__noemo	That's all right .
__label__noemo	Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
__label__noemo	And you got them off the Net ?
__label__noemo	Yes , in most circumstances .
__label__noemo	1021.It ' s a duet ! Come on , Pick the mic and sing along !
__label__noemo	How many languages can you speak ?
__label__joy	Fine . I'll be expecting you around two .
__label__noemo	Daddy , what's next ? What else do we do now ?
__label__noemo	Do you have anything to declare ?
__label__noemo	Who did the stupid thing ?
__label__joy	Tonight is a party night ! What drinks do you think we need ?
__label__joy	I hope not .
__label__noemo	Yes , on Monday .
__label__noemo	Yes , the teacher says recitation is real good .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , sir . May I go with you to claim my luggage ? I am a stranger here .
__label__noemo	Mark ? What were you up to yesterday ? I called you , but there wasn ’ t anybody home .
__label__noemo	Well , whatever suits your fancy . I'll press the service button again .
__label__noemo	Mom ! How can I help with the washing up ?
__label__noemo	I hope so .
__label__joy	Good .
__label__noemo	How long will it take me to get there ?
__label__noemo	As obnoxious as Bean is , we should still try to finish this case .
__label__sadness	My mother just passed away last Tuesday .
__label__anger	I don't have a warrant .
__label__noemo	are you doing anything this weekend ?
__label__noemo	The wine list is posted right there on the board .
__label__noemo	You have got a car , haven ’ t you ?
__label__noemo	What do you reading , Linda ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me , sir , the toilet in my room doesn't flush .
__label__noemo	Is there someone I can talk to about a payment question ?
__label__noemo	I know . But I want to start today with a little weight lifting.Then I'm going to buy a new swimming suit and goggles , and every other day I'm going to go swim laps in the pool . How does that sound ?
__label__noemo	Do you drive a car yourself ?
__label__noemo	You are looking really healthy lately . What are you doing differently ?
__label__noemo	Organic ? What ’ s organic ? Do we need organic carrots ... ?
__label__noemo	There is a Matisse exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art . Larry and I will go .
__label__noemo	Oh yes , and fruits . I love fruits very much .
__label__noemo	Can you name a few examples ?
__label__noemo	As an existing banker , that will speed up the process . You said you had the documents with you ?
__label__noemo	I changed my diet recently , and I eat a lot healthier now .
__label__joy	That's what I was thinking .
__label__noemo	Do you want to ensure the contents , Miss ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I know I am excellent , but I pay no attention to the etiquette you ’ Ve told me .
__label__noemo	There are two ways to respond . You can either come back with another offer or go with their counter-offer .
__label__noemo	Maybe .
__label__noemo	Hi , Zina . Lots of people are looking for you .
__label__noemo	Hold on , that's an item . You should put that in the recycle bin next to the trashcan .
__label__noemo	Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut .
__label__joy	So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday .
__label__noemo	Good morning . What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	You have to pay a fine .
__label__noemo	I'll bet you were a little embarrassed .
__label__noemo	It's absolutely free ?
__label__noemo	I quite like this one.How much is it ?
__label__noemo	Didn ’ t you punch in this morning , Monica ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much and anything else ?
__label__noemo	Just watching some TV .
__label__noemo	Everyone needs to be there .
__label__noemo	Well , the salary is a little low , but the students are nice . How are things with you ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to buy a ticket to Casablanca on flight US125 tomorrow .
__label__noemo	I guess you are right .
__label__noemo	Your total comes to $ 5.48 .
__label__noemo	I want to make sure I bring enough money for my date and I .
__label__noemo	Alright . I have you down for ten AM this Friday .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid not .
__label__noemo	What's wrong with it ?
__label__noemo	Then it wasn't meant to be . Some people have put up a hard fight for some items I bid on . But I was the sole bidder for this bag and got it dirt-cheap .
__label__noemo	You do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you .
__label__joy	That ’ s great !
__label__noemo	There are several possible sources you might use for that topic . I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television .
__label__noemo	We want to order 3,000 cases and hope to deliver the goods in two equal lots .
__label__joy	Thank you . Good-bye .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry , Sir , but you will need to come in to your local branch to deal with the application procedure . Come in and fill out an application form and let us have a duplicate of your ID card . You'll also need a copy of your guarantor's and he or she will need to sign the form , too .
__label__surprise	Congratulations , Bob ! That ’ s great news , what ’ s her name ?
__label__noemo	I think I might have a dahl .
__label__noemo	I'll see if she is in .
__label__noemo	Nowadays , they offer so many services , you hardly know which one to choose . Take mailing for example . Do you send something first class or second class or do you use EMS ?
__label__joy	Use this lipstick and it will make your lips shine !
__label__noemo	I went bankrupt and I'm flat broke now .
__label__noemo	I see . What are the options ? I suppose airmail is faster and more expensive than surface mail .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Computers are great , aren ’ t they ? I should download some programs and learn how to use them .
__label__noemo	Goodness , we ’ re not having much luck here , are we ?
__label__joy	Good . I'm a regular customer here . I am glad you can make an exception for me .
__label__noemo	I won't .
__label__noemo	So Peter , do you have a favorite comedy ?
__label__noemo	No , I'll e paying for myself , but I have private medical insurance .
__label__noemo	Yeah , more people need to take public transportation or carpool .
__label__noemo	Terrific . There is one girl said , It is the best game I've ever watched .
__label__noemo	As soon as possible , because I've got an important meeting to attend .
__label__noemo	Goodness ! It ’ s been so long I actually forgot . Let me see ... yes , it is on my calendar .
__label__noemo	No .
__label__noemo	Does that include the insurance ?
__label__joy	How are you , Sue ?
__label__noemo	Sure . We love each other and take care of each other .
__label__noemo	I was on a diet and exercised daily .
__label__noemo	What are you unhappy with ?
__label__noemo	Would you like me to blow-dry your hair ?
__label__noemo	My dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quiet village in England .
__label__noemo	Well , we do the same things every weekend . We go to the same restaurants . We see the same friends . You know what I mean ?
__label__joy	It is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active .
__label__noemo	C'mon . I get nervous when I talk to girls .
__label__noemo	No , it is a fortnightly . So , you see , I can get the new one quite soon .
__label__noemo	Yes , sir . May I have your laundry ticket , please ?
__label__joy	You , too . Thanks for your help .
__label__noemo	I need to save the rest .
__label__noemo	How is the result of your lab test ?
__label__sadness	No , I didn't . I'm sorry . It won't happen again .
__label__noemo	When ?
__label__noemo	Why would I spy on you ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry to hear that.What kind of movie do you like ?
__label__noemo	A large , with tons of ketchup .
__label__noemo	I think you'll like them . My family is pretty laid back .
__label__noemo	Since it's not working , I'm going to give you a credit .
__label__joy	It wasn't too crowded , but we had a great time ! We got on the see-saw together , then went on a couple of different slides and then I tried to go with him in the jungle gym , but I didn't fit .
__label__noemo	Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me !
__label__surprise	skim , please . That'd be very nice . Thanks ... oh no . Janna , I'm so sorry , but I've got to go .
__label__noemo	Do you believe what they say ?
__label__noemo	not really . When I was little , we didn't really listen to music at all .
__label__noemo	What would you like , sir ?
__label__noemo	Certainly , you're welcome anytime .
__label__noemo	Which one has better nightlife ?
__label__noemo	The 16:45 , please .
__label__noemo	Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up .
__label__noemo	What was the problem ?
__label__joy	I wish you a pleasant stay here .
__label__anger	Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer !
__label__noemo	You don ’ t have to starve yourself to lose weight . I think that ’ s where you ’ re going wrong .
__label__joy	I am very glad that you say so . We have prepared a typical Chinese dinner this evening .
__label__noemo	You must have dialed the wrong number .
__label__joy	Never mind . There's an authentic tasting hot pot restaurant not far from the China World Trade Towers on Chang An Street . Have you been there ?
__label__joy	My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ?
__label__noemo	Sounds not good . I won't take it .
__label__noemo	Is it a long run to the station ?
__label__noemo	Right . So in some way we are happier .
__label__noemo	Maybe I should go home .
__label__noemo	Turn left at the second light and then go straight for two blocks .
__label__noemo	From the numbers , it seems like Forest Inc . is our digest competitor ... Le'Ban and Markford are also major contenders in our market .
__label__anger	But Christmas was two weeks ago ! It ’ s been there only because we ’ Ve been too busy to get rid of it .
__label__joy	Yes , there is beautiful view . You can go fishing , camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air .
__label__noemo	Can you stay and accompany me for a while ?
__label__joy	Not at all , Sam .
__label__noemo	I'm thinking about taking his class next semester .
__label__noemo	Not at all.You can find most of them in supermarkets.The ingredients are usually the same as in Western food.The way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients .
__label__joy	Oh , congratulations ! Sounds like you ’ Ve found your soul mate .
__label__noemo	How long will it take for our order to be delivered ?
__label__noemo	Could you change these for me , please ?
__label__noemo	How well do you know English ?
__label__noemo	I am going to the airport , and I have to catch the 930 flight to New York .
__label__noemo	Good morning , sir . May I help you ?
__label__joy	I'll be there on time .
__label__noemo	Melissa ? I ’ d like to invite you to my wife ’ s birthday party .
__label__noemo	Can I buy more than one case ?
__label__joy	Would you like to do something tonight ?
__label__joy	I think it looks gorgeous .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . I would like to book a table at 13:00 .
__label__noemo	What kind of personality do you think you have ?
__label__noemo	I'm here to open a Current Account with your bank .
__label__noemo	You shouldn't have used the machine.Did you lose your money ?
__label__noemo	I want some chicken and potatoes .
__label__joy	That's great . That means I can bring my cat , Mr . Twinkles . Where is the apartment located ?
__label__noemo	Their family is very similar to Cindy and Ron ’ s family .
__label__noemo	Make sure that you have money allocated for these supplies . How much do you have for office supplies ?
__label__noemo	You are not telling me that we drove 50 miles to come here for just sunbath , are you ?
__label__noemo	Walking under the sun is certainly not the way .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry . We don't have this color in your size . We have some green ones in your size . Would you please have a look at this green one ?
__label__noemo	We provide our employees with training opportunities at home and abroad .
__label__joy	Sure . It's undoubtedly one of the biggest classical music events . Have you ever been to the live show ?
__label__noemo	Yes , probably but I may look for another one when we're settled in .
__label__noemo	I find it there is no meaning in living this world .
__label__noemo	How much money do you expect in this position ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s right .
__label__noemo	Harry , do you like the opera ?
__label__noemo	I would , but I don't have any in my tackle box .
__label__noemo	You saw a ghost ? When ?
__label__joy	It's my favorite .
__label__noemo	Well , tell me something of yourself .
__label__noemo	What happened ?
__label__joy	Yes.That would be good .
__label__noemo	Hi , Fanny .
__label__noemo	Who will take your place ?
__label__noemo	No . why don ’ t we describe and buy at the coffee shop next door ?
__label__noemo	Then this is the right bus . Move on , please . You're holding up the passengers . Tian'anmen Square is the last stop but one .
__label__noemo	What's the hardware ?
__label__noemo	What bus can I catch to get to the Gold Line ?
__label__noemo	Well , I want to change 1000 Australian dollars for RIB .
__label__joy	Thank you . Now I see that you are my true friend . Most of my so-called friends left me at the moment my company went bankrupt . You are the only one who has stood by me the whole time .
__label__noemo	May I have a look at this ?
__label__joy	You're welcome , bye !
__label__joy	Mine . It's My Heart Will Go On , the theme song of Titanic . Isn't it of strong character ?
__label__noemo	People here always wear the best clothes they have . Many people go out and buy clothes especially for New Year's Eve .
__label__noemo	Well , our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . I'm afraid it's very difficult to improve any further on the time .
__label__noemo	Is Bob home ?
__label__noemo	I am new to the work and I will appreciate your guidance !
__label__noemo	Well , it's very expensive and they're usually singing in another language . That kind of gets on my nerves .
__label__noemo	Well , I think there's one across from the shopping center .
__label__noemo	Poor Kevin , we should do something for him . He is a nice guy and does his job well .
__label__noemo	But it's said that you dance wonderfully well .
__label__noemo	I don't blame you for getting some rest .
__label__noemo	I am sorry , there is no difference .
__label__noemo	I really appreciate your time and help . See you then .
__label__noemo	May I have a magazine or a newspaper please ?
__label__noemo	I'd love to help if I can .
__label__disgust	Oh , no !
__label__noemo	What would you like for dessert , sir ? We have a choice of cake or ice cream .
__label__noemo	So I wonder why you want to work for a newspaper .
__label__noemo	Why not just tell him I'm sick ? I'll ring him myself this afternoon .
__label__joy	I ’ m glad you could find time to meet with me , Mr . Johnson . I can ’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely !
__label__noemo	Do they have a good team ?
__label__noemo	Apples and pears , one kilo for each af them , please .
__label__noemo	we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking .
__label__noemo	Yeah , let's go Joe's Disco .
__label__noemo	Are you in Mrs . Green ’ s class ?
__label__joy	Ok . Boy , this looks expensive .
__label__noemo	Next question , Is a queen-size bed okay ?
__label__noemo	Wow , all this for forty dollars per month ?
__label__joy	How are you these days ?
__label__noemo	But it's still early .
__label__noemo	What happens now ?
__label__noemo	Sure . It's really very easy . First , mix together an egg , two teaspoons of salt , and two pounds of ground beef . Then , add two ounces of milk . Are you with me ?
__label__noemo	I am going to go home after the holidays and we're going to have a Christmas kind of in January or February . Yeah , depending on when my brother can come in .
__label__noemo	I ’ m not sure where to pick up my ballot .
__label__noemo	Management isn't looking on the labor unions too favorably , I'd guess . I don't blame them ... labor unions can really put the squeeze on the executives .
__label__noemo	Do you want to transfer money from that account ?
__label__noemo	( XXXXXXXXXX ) OK ( XXXXXXXXXX ) .
__label__noemo	Hey ! What's up ?
__label__joy	Exactly . Having Jo as my friend is one of the best things that's ever happened to me .
__label__noemo	well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there !
__label__noemo	How old are you ?
__label__noemo	Either in the overhead compartment or underneath the seat .
__label__noemo	Sounds like you may be far-sighted . OK , then , cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you .
__label__noemo	We share the same bathroom , in other words .
__label__noemo	Good morning , sir . Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Come on ! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves 。
__label__noemo	I need to purchase some business cards .
__label__noemo	My pleasure .
__label__noemo	Is it possible for someone to come a little earlier ?
__label__noemo	He isn't a man of good taste for clothes , is he ?
__label__joy	Thanks for your explanation , I would like it well-done .
__label__noemo	Ok .
__label__noemo	Can you tell me where I can park ?
__label__noemo	Hi there . Welcome to Lincoln Corporate Services . How can we help ?
__label__noemo	How did you get into hip hop ?
__label__noemo	"We sing "" Happy Birthday "" at the party and have birthday cakes ."
__label__noemo	How long have you had it ?
__label__noemo	one glass of red wine coming up !
__label__noemo	I would always be ready to go shopping with you ! Should we talk about other basics ?
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I didn ’ t know that ! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
__label__noemo	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	Sure , I'll take mine , sunny side up .
__label__noemo	Well , then , please tell me about your English education .
__label__noemo	I have lived here for twenty years .
__label__noemo	I voted for him .
__label__noemo	Thank you.that will be all . I ’ ll take care of it .
__label__sadness	I am sorry , madam . All the tables are booked now .
__label__noemo	I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
__label__noemo	Relax , those buses run every 10 minutes , so we have plenty of time .
__label__noemo	Yes , what do you want to know ?
__label__noemo	Oh . It's nothing Navy .
__label__noemo	like what ?
__label__noemo	So how do you intend to do that ?
__label__noemo	Yup .
__label__noemo	Certainly . What's the matter ?
__label__noemo	What's the reason that people prefer to read this one ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much . We really had a good time .
__label__noemo	By how much ?
__label__noemo	Hello , Kristy . Could I speak to the department that deals with credit card applications , please ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I'd like a crab cocktail .
__label__noemo	Let's walk around the lake first , shall we ?
__label__noemo	Is Friday good ?
__label__noemo	How did you get involved in something like that ?
__label__joy	Until 8 o'clock madam . We are looking forward to seeing you .
__label__noemo	Yes , we ’ Ve got a reservation . The name is Ann .
__label__noemo	Do you have whisky ?
__label__noemo	I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana . She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night .
__label__noemo	How much is it ?
__label__noemo	Let me take your blood pressure . You look anemic .
__label__noemo	I think £ 5 would be good .
__label__noemo	Hello , Is this EYE computers ?
__label__noemo	I like playing chess .
__label__joy	I will ! I could use some good luck !
__label__noemo	No . Just want to relax a little bit . You don't have to win the lottery to relax , do you ?
__label__noemo	Heads .
__label__noemo	That ’ s the man I told you about . Remember ?
__label__noemo	Extra lean .
__label__surprise	Oh my gosh , that one says Temple City .
__label__noemo	Hello , is it necessary to do warm-up exercise ? I can't wait to dive into the water .
__label__surprise	Seriously ?
__label__noemo	What size do you take ?
__label__noemo	Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .
__label__anger	Excuse me ! I don't have time to waste . I've been here almost one full hour !
__label__noemo	Unbutton your shirt , please .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid we can't increase salary this year , money is just too title .
__label__noemo	No , it's just the two of us .
__label__noemo	Before you go on , Ms Yang , could you tell us if the original EBB sold well in the U . S . ?
__label__joy	Would you honor us with a visit ?
__label__noemo	It means that we will arrive on the same day .
__label__noemo	The faucet in the kitchen is leaking .
__label__noemo	Where will you be staying ?
__label__noemo	Well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides .
__label__noemo	Middle size
__label__noemo	Do you like amusement parks ?
__label__joy	My pleasure . You're a sweet couple . Do you have any questions ?
__label__noemo	I like baseball and basketball .
__label__noemo	Welcome to our company .
__label__noemo	Hello , is that 2896919 16 ?
__label__noemo	Have you figured out who you ’ re going to vote for ?
__label__noemo	You can use a credit card or your debit card . They also let you use the Paypal system which is really safe and fast . I have never had any problems with someone hacking my information or anything .
__label__noemo	Would you please make a skirt for me with this material please ?
__label__fear	Oh , I hate having teeth pulled out . Will it hurt ?
__label__noemo	I was preparing my supper but I've finished now .
__label__noemo	to be honest , I don't really care for either one .
__label__noemo	Shooting guard . The same as Michael Jordan !
__label__noemo	Yes , that ’ s correct .
__label__noemo	I don't know . I sat down in my seat , looked at my paper , and then my mind just went totally blank .
__label__noemo	No , I only receive my salary .
__label__surprise	Are you kidding ? That place is too ritzy for lunch .
__label__noemo	Don't worry about it . All in all , you've done very well in school .
__label__noemo	Yes , I need a wake-up call tomorrow at seven thirty .
__label__noemo	Do you have anything to declare ?
__label__noemo	Lobster ? It is steamed and served with our special sauce .
__label__noemo	Huh ? Oh , my name is Laura .
__label__noemo	I saw a program a few months ago about how animals are raised for human consumption . I haven't been able to eat a single piece of meat since .
__label__joy	Don't mention it . It is my duty .
__label__joy	Thank you for saying so .
__label__noemo	Come on , you think about what to wear almost every day . There are thousands of clothes in your wardrobe .
__label__noemo	I'm not certain . Do you know ?
__label__surprise	Really ? What kind ? A girl left this word to me , and I thought she was in Hong Kong .
__label__noemo	No , please don't . I couldn't let you do that .
__label__noemo	Well , one year would be fine , too . I ’ m not planning on leaving the area anytime soon .
__label__noemo	Wait . What's the time , honey ?
__label__noemo	When do you celebrate Thanksgiving ?
__label__noemo	I know in your resume that you have worked in your present company for 3 years , can you tell me why you want to leave your present job and join us ?
__label__noemo	Get on the phone right now . It might not be too late .
__label__noemo	Well , the cigarettes and the champagne are not in excess of the duty-free allowance . But according to our law , each passenger is allowed only one camera duty-free.You ' ll have to pay duty for the other one .
__label__noemo	John , I ’ d like you to meet Charles Brown , our new manager at the airport .
__label__noemo	Sorry , I never go out on Saturday evening . I always watch football on Saturday evening .
__label__joy	Awesome ! I'm in heaven . Let me help . They're so easy .
__label__surprise	I don't understand why you would do that .
__label__noemo	If I survive the next six months .
__label__noemo	Which train do you want ?
__label__noemo	Yeah . The final is next week . You have to watch it .
__label__noemo	For today ?
__label__noemo	That'll be nonsmoking . Now , do you approve of a single queen-size bed ?
__label__noemo	That's right , Nigel . I think we can keep cost down .
__label__noemo	No , not yet . I ’ m still looking . I ’ Ve been doing some work through a temp-agency though .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . What time does the next train to London leave ?
__label__noemo	I want to open an account .
__label__noemo	Hey , Michael . Remember me ? I'm Becky . We used to work at Lemans together .
__label__noemo	I'd like to open a new account .
__label__noemo	May I have your name , please ?
__label__noemo	That's perfect .
__label__joy	Yes , there is one behind our building . And you can play tennis there . But if you want to play tennis there , they will change you 30 Yuan per hour .
__label__joy	Certainly , would you wait for a few minutes ?
__label__noemo	I see . And how about the working hours ?
__label__noemo	I hope so .
__label__joy	All right .
__label__noemo	How long can I keep the books ?
__label__noemo	But the ads say they're most nutritious .
__label__noemo	it is . Our customers really like it . Do you have any other questions about your new accounts ?
__label__noemo	Yes . This way , please . Our shortbread is in a variety of flavors , such as almond , walnut , lotus seed , etc . And different packaging has different weights . We can make packages within a reasonable range of any size you require .
__label__noemo	Marty Smith . M-A-R-T-Y , S-M-I-T-H
__label__noemo	That's the point . Your overhead is in your domestic price , but it can't be carried in the CIF price .
__label__noemo	I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day .
__label__noemo	Of course .
__label__noemo	My German teacher thought it would be a good idea to have German pen friends to write to in German .
__label__noemo	Do you have enough money ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me . Is anyone sitting here ?
__label__joy	Thanks so much .
__label__noemo	There are so many record players here . That is hard to choose .
__label__noemo	Yes , I do . Everyone .
__label__noemo	Oh . I'm sorry . But is this 321-9987 ?
__label__noemo	Just joking , T . I've got some wonderful clothes . Let's go and have a close look at your outfit .
__label__noemo	When I quarrel with my husband . He didn't even try to cool me out .
__label__noemo	Not too much . I'm looking to rent an apartment .
__label__noemo	I feel he is as cold as charity to me .
__label__noemo	About three times a week if I can .
__label__noemo	What about the weather in Boston ?
__label__noemo	I can't . I am already behind the schedule . Besides , you know Mr . White . He would think that I was putting him on .
__label__joy	They aren't hard . I am sure you can do it .
__label__noemo	It's a bit too large . Would you please shorten the sleeves ?
__label__noemo	The bigger they are , the harder they fall .
__label__joy	Thanks for reminding me . She's the right person to help me .
__label__joy	We ’ re going to the movies . Will you join us ?
__label__noemo	Alright , the puck is back in play now . Pavel Bure is on a breakaway ! He is flying down the ice ! The defenders can ’ t keep up ! Slap shot ! He scores
__label__joy	I'll be expecting you then .
__label__noemo	Go ahead . It ’ s OK with me .
__label__joy	OK , I will.Thank you .
__label__noemo	You mustn't pick it in this place .
__label__noemo	The personal card , please . Is it possible to take care of this over the phone ?
__label__noemo	Hi . You look excited . What's happening ?
__label__noemo	Sir , you can use the gym for free . All you need is your room key .
__label__noemo	I ’ m ok . I ’ m so busy !
__label__noemo	Sarah , what did you do today ?
__label__joy	Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening.Would you like to come with me ?
__label__noemo	You're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit .
__label__noemo	Not me . I'm too hot and I'm too tired .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot . You are so kind .
__label__noemo	Okay . Get back to your work , and call me back this evening .
__label__noemo	not too well ! I ’ m just to the doctor . I haven ’ t been feeling too well .. over the last few days .
__label__noemo	My company wants to become involved in your Comprehensive Credit Granting . We are a very young company and I'm not at all sure if we meet your credit requirements .
__label__noemo	What do you mean ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry . I won't do it again .
__label__noemo	Well , I certainly did .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . I think I have got lost in the Art Gallery . Can you tell me the way to the exit .
__label__noemo	Yeah . It's pretty exciting to be here .
__label__noemo	I have no bad habit . I sleep eight hours a day , never eat spicy food , clean the face twice a day and so on . I have done a lot .
__label__noemo	We had a difference of opinion .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Yes.Let ' s hold a birthday party for him , shall we ?
__label__noemo	And to drink ?
__label__noemo	Let's look at them all.Have you got a paper there ?
__label__noemo	Ok , then we'll go by train . I'm sure we'll have a good journey.Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ?
__label__noemo	Can you tell me about the other class ?
__label__surprise	The best ... huh ? With so many companies out there , how did they establish themselves in such a solid position on top ?
__label__noemo	Is there one in particular that you like ?
__label__noemo	I think a Chinese student concentrates on written English , and uses it as a basis for communicating . From start to finish he ’ s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . This is a very difficult way to learn .
__label__noemo	We charge ten cents a copy .
__label__noemo	sure thing . What are your plans for the evening ?
__label__noemo	OK , I will prepare it right now .
__label__noemo	Oh , and it's out of paper . Do you have any more ?
__label__noemo	That sounds interesting .
__label__noemo	You can choose one type to make it as your background , and then find a music player and put your favorite songs into it , so your visitors can enjoy the music after entering into your zone .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__noemo	I would back him up to the hilt anyway .
__label__noemo	Of course , Sir .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t worry , Shan always screws up free throws .
__label__noemo	I want to study abroad .
__label__noemo	That ’ s both fortunate and unfortunate . It ’ s the United Nations in my class ! We have people from all over the world ! There are three Germans , a Pole , a Scottish , two French , an American , a Brazilian ,
__label__noemo	So , if for some reason I was having a bad month and spent a little too much I could just pay the minimum ?
__label__noemo	Well I wanted to go for a picnic but it rained too much .
__label__joy	Wow . He's heavy ! And his skin feels really cool .
__label__noemo	Okay . I'll take your word for it .
__label__noemo	543210 .
__label__noemo	Certainly , perhaps .
__label__noemo	It's December eighteenth .
__label__noemo	Hello . May I help you ?
__label__joy	I hope you like it .
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	What university would you enter ?
__label__noemo	Well , black is a better color than pink . Pink ’ s for girls .
__label__noemo	Now we're getting to the truth .
__label__noemo	that ’ s true . I ’ m wondering did you learn anything from the job ?
__label__noemo	Yes . And there's a walk-in closet .
__label__joy	We should hang out some time .
__label__noemo	My father failed in business .
__label__noemo	You say that now , Lily , but you'll thank me later . I'm your mom , and mother knows best .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__noemo	Could you show me the T-shirt on the model ?
__label__noemo	What time would you like the reservation for ?
__label__noemo	That's a beautiful city . When do you want to go there ?
__label__noemo	So I heard .
__label__noemo	Oh , is it ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I do .
__label__noemo	How's John doing ?
__label__noemo	Nothing . I have told you before that I won't go to the party and that's flat .
__label__noemo	Hello , is there anything I can do for you ?
__label__joy	I think we ’ ll benefit a lot .
__label__noemo	Will you come round next Tuesday ?
__label__noemo	Do you know if there's a convenience store around here ?
__label__noemo	Don't worry . It's safe .
__label__noemo	What is the material of this dress ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ?
__label__noemo	With the fifty forwards he sent out today , maybe we'll inadvertently get inspired .
__label__noemo	No , I don't . You look pretty busy today . Do you have an opening for me ?
__label__noemo	Thank you for your interest . The position is still available . Have you already sent your CV to us ?
__label__noemo	Yes . We are exporting a wide range of foodstuffs to many countries . And the demand is getting greater and greater.By the way , which items are you interested in ?
__label__noemo	It's the Powell orchestra .
__label__noemo	Yes , . Do you mind I have a look at your computer ?
__label__noemo	Shall I gift-wrap them for you , sir ?
__label__noemo	Sure . It ’ s like understanding on the telephone — — you can ’ t see the speaker ! It ’ s great for improving listening comprehension .
__label__noemo	No , not the really , don't worry about it , like I said there'll be a lot of people there doing the same thing that you are doing , so just follow the crowd , There's only one direction to go , so you won't get on the wrong train . Head north on the Yellow line , and you'll see Wudaokou in just a couple of stops .
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve met some of my colleagues already . I ’ m sure we ’ ll get on well together .
__label__noemo	Not paying attention to the speedometer ? Why not ?
__label__noemo	That will be 600 RIB . Could I have your credit card please ?
__label__surprise	University ? Why ? You asked me last year .
__label__noemo	OK . I'll take it . Will you gift-wrap this , please ?
__label__noemo	Not yet .
__label__noemo	No wonder .
__label__noemo	What problems did you find ?
__label__joy	Yes . I love living here .
__label__noemo	Right , it was a chick flick , just like this one , so what's the difference ? Besides , this is the last week for the third movie in Destroyer series and I want to see that on a big screen . Action movies need to be seen in a theater on a big screen .
__label__anger	Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways .
__label__noemo	There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
__label__surprise	Whoa wait a minute ! Isn ’ t that a bit too much ? I mean , how much is all of this going to cost !
__label__noemo	maybe . How about a mochaccino ? Are they any good ?
__label__noemo	I attend an aerobic class three times a week .
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__joy	Hey , check out this new game I bought today .
__label__noemo	I have nausea , and I am dizzy . Also I have a abdominal pain .
__label__noemo	Just yesterday . I'm still getting used to it .
__label__noemo	Please tell me exactly what happened .
__label__noemo	What is my schedule for today , Miss Liu ?
__label__noemo	I would love for it to rain today .
__label__noemo	most some drinks have too much sugar in them .
__label__joy	How about going to Joe's Restaurant .
__label__noemo	I wonder if you can change it to one size down .
__label__noemo	What ’ s your favourite ball sport ?
__label__noemo	No problem , I can do that for you right now . Have you checked the documents ?
__label__joy	It sure looks special , looks expensive too .
__label__noemo	Not really . I watched television for an hour .
__label__noemo	Fine .
__label__joy	Yes , we're all proud of her !
__label__noemo	not much ; it was a minor offence back then . He got away with a fine of $ 500 .
__label__noemo	I think you've got a real bargain .
__label__noemo	I work in a publishing house . How about you ?
__label__noemo	Passport and disembarkation card , please .
__label__noemo	I guess I was asking for too much .
__label__noemo	he is an extrovert while she is an introvert . He likes parties while she hates them .
__label__noemo	That's all right . At least I got myself left .
__label__noemo	I think I'll put my bag in the overhead compartment .
__label__noemo	OK . Let's go .
__label__noemo	Oh , I'm starving . I'd like to try some real Chinese cuisine . What would you recommend , waiter ?
__label__noemo	Looks like it . So how did he handle it to ?
__label__noemo	The local newspaper has ads for housing .
__label__joy	The style of the exterior is just what I ’ Ve been looking for !
__label__noemo	Why did your parents make you stay at home ?
__label__joy	You're welcome.Good luck , bye !
__label__noemo	why didn ’ t you answer my question ?
__label__noemo	What do you mean ? You think I don't write enough .
__label__noemo	I expected that something might get broken . That doesn ’ t bother me . That spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ?
__label__noemo	Mmm , I don ’ t think the charges are right , can you explain them please ?
__label__noemo	We can print as many as you like . Just tell me how many .
__label__noemo	I stick to my principles and keep to the rules . Sometimes , they just lack enthusiasm and I get them involved with something constructive . Some of them change their attitude later .
__label__noemo	Come on , you don't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity .
__label__noemo	Cheese ...
__label__noemo	Are you going to the beach this saturday afternoon ?
__label__noemo	Yeah.But Bob's talent can't to be named on the same day with Carl's .
__label__noemo	Can I get you any dessert ?
__label__noemo	How often ?
__label__noemo	Good afternoon , sir . Have you made a reservation ?
__label__noemo	First , we're going to change the curtains , then we're going to paint the walls .
__label__noemo	No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space .
__label__noemo	Oh , really ?
__label__noemo	Hey , John . Nice car .
__label__noemo	Okay , Rebecca . Now you ’ Ve given me a good idea of your work and academic background , but what about you as a person ? How would you describe your key strengths ?
__label__noemo	The contract is to be written in Chinese and English . Both languages are equally effective .
__label__noemo	I've just had some money sent from Germany , in Euros .
__label__noemo	One thousand yuan , please . By the way , what is today's exchange quotation ?
__label__noemo	Why don't we take him out ? We can try to take his mind off of it . In the least show him that we're there for him .
__label__noemo	We'd better leave him alone .
__label__noemo	MI stands for Middle Initial .
__label__noemo	John , could you come to my office ? I need to talk to you .
__label__noemo	What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Right .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I don't mind it either . We ’ ll both end up rich slobs and not need it , but what if we do , you know ?
__label__noemo	When you are able to find work and get paid , we always take away part of your check .
__label__noemo	I used cassette recorders a lot when I studied English in high school .
__label__noemo	Here it is , sir .
__label__noemo	What would you like for lunch , pork , mutton or beef ?
__label__noemo	no , but we're trying to contact them .
__label__noemo	Basically . But I have no idea what to get ! She's American and kind of ...
__label__noemo	All right . I want to bring everybody in on this project . When can we start working on this ?
__label__noemo	My understanding is that CIF means the seller is responsible for prepaying shipping costs and arranging for the insurance policy .
__label__noemo	The plane must fuel before flying to Paris .
__label__joy	It doesn't matter . I will teach you .
__label__anger	I said sunny side up ! How many times do I have to tell you .
__label__noemo	What ? You want to leave early ?
__label__noemo	$ 800 .
__label__joy	Mom !
__label__noemo	Yes . And I've brought some documents along with me , too . Do you need to see my passport ?
__label__noemo	Whew ! I had to wait for almost an hour to get to the front of the line .
__label__noemo	Well , uh ... I didn't catch the last part .
__label__noemo	Turn left at the second light and then go straight for two blocks .
__label__noemo	Positive . I ’ ll put the radio on .
__label__noemo	We'd like you to execute the first delivery by June 30 and the second delivery by August 15 .
__label__anger	It's really very easy saying you're sorry .
__label__noemo	Do you mean lying to people for their good ?
__label__noemo	Ok , maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street .
__label__noemo	What is your most preferred training method ?
__label__joy	Yes , I ’ d love another glass . You ’ re a wonderful host . Thank you for everything .
__label__noemo	Please send this memo out to all the managerial staff ... there will be training for all the department heads next week . Attendance for managerial staff is mandatory , except for the financial department . Financial officers may participate if their schedules allow .
__label__noemo	Of course . In Europe , they charge a commission of 1 % of the amount of the claim for their service .
__label__noemo	I didn't sleep a wink last night .
__label__noemo	I ’ m going to paint it .
__label__noemo	They're like a citrus fruit .
__label__noemo	Is she your teacher ?
__label__noemo	Can we have two a joining double room , sir ?
__label__joy	This home is gorgeous on the inside !
__label__noemo	It ’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .
__label__joy	She likes to complain about her macho husband and her “ bambinos ” , but she loves them all dearly .
__label__noemo	Did you like the party ?
__label__noemo	How long will it take to get the regular one ?
__label__joy	Glad to meet you , Ms.Baker .
__label__joy	It's certainly a popular hobby . I know a lot of people love stamps .
__label__noemo	That sounds fine to me . Yes , I think 6 months is the way to go .
__label__noemo	Such as ...
__label__noemo	sounds reasonable.Even if I'm the right one for the job , many people are applying for the same vacancy at the same time , so I should try my best to catch the Human Resources manager's attention .
__label__joy	This dish tastes terrific . Would you like to try a little ? It is a little hot , but very good .
__label__noemo	how did you meet each other ?
__label__noemo	What's in the box ?
__label__noemo	Yeah . I think so.You have to be patient and careful .
__label__noemo	do students have to wear uniforms in schools in America ?
__label__noemo	Certainly . What's your topic ?
__label__noemo	There is that .
__label__noemo	Of course , I have Monday or Tuesday available . What day would be best for you ?
__label__noemo	In foreign trade , exporters have to adjust their product in a timely manner .
__label__noemo	That's all right .
__label__joy	Oh , that will be great . Thank you so much . Please help me to double-check the name list . I have to make sure they are all correct .
__label__joy	Yes . It looks terrific !
__label__noemo	I need some to keep as souvenirs !
__label__noemo	Belinda , I ’ m going to a party tonight . What shall I wear ?
__label__noemo	OK . Do you plan to go to America all by yourself or with your family ?
__label__noemo	hey , I started a diet and lost 10 pounds .
__label__noemo	Your performance so far is not quite in line with what we expect for our executives . I hope I ’ Ve made my point .
__label__noemo	So , it ’ s easy to get to the office from here . From your apartment , just drive along King Street East for about one kilometer and you ’ ll see a three-story blue building on your right . That ’ s the Department of Motor Vehicles building where you can change your driver ’ s license .
__label__noemo	8825 1127 4235 9869 .
__label__noemo	I know your feeling . Take it easy .
__label__noemo	Tomorrow I'll take you to some places that I'm sure you will have interest in .
__label__noemo	How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ?
__label__noemo	Bye !
__label__sadness	it was also a proud day for me , but I also felt like a kind of loss that day .
__label__noemo	Ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses !
__label__noemo	Really ? Are you still playing ?
__label__joy	So cool . Someone gave me this flier at the exit . What's it about ?
__label__noemo	You look a little lost , can I help you ?
__label__noemo	How much does it cost ?
__label__noemo	Can you tell me what's included in your warranty ?
__label__noemo	Did they have lobster ?
__label__noemo	Oh , no . Charlie , where is my purse ?
__label__noemo	That doesn't justify your violation . May I see your licence , please ?
__label__noemo	Could you call Mr . Jacob for me , Sara ? I need to go over some stuff with him .
__label__noemo	Just in case , right ?
__label__joy	Nice to meet you , Andrew . I am Noirin , Noirin O'Neil .
__label__noemo	How often is the bonus ?
__label__noemo	She's getting coupons from her desk .
__label__noemo	Yes , I remembered to bring my ticket with me today .
__label__noemo	Yes . The gas station is on the left . And you can't miss it .
__label__noemo	What's for dinner ?
__label__joy	Sure ! Please just fill in your I . D . number and ways to contact you here .
__label__joy	I'll be there . Oh , is there a cover charge at the bar ?
__label__noemo	Were you at the scene during the robbery ?
__label__noemo	What courses are you taking ?
__label__noemo	I wish I had access to the public library .
__label__noemo	When can you begin ?
__label__joy	That happens to be my favorite . Waiter , I think we're ready to order .
__label__noemo	When you are choosing what to wear , keep all of that in mind . Have you chosen what to wear ?
__label__noemo	Yes , we had a meting about it yesterday afternoon .
__label__noemo	Yes , I ’ m afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too .
__label__noemo	Oh dear . I don't have it with me . Do you take debit cards or should I pay with cash ?
__label__noemo	It is all right . I will call the boss and tell him I am staying another day . I stayed an extra night in Boston last month and he didn ’ t seem to put about it .
__label__noemo	Um , this steak , I asked for to be medium rare .
__label__noemo	I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .
__label__noemo	How may I help you today ?
__label__anger	Well , I can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance .
__label__surprise	Really ? Tell me about some of the plants they showed .
__label__noemo	I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put in for a transfer ?
__label__noemo	Look out , honey . Let's come to the shoal waters . Follow me !
__label__noemo	I want to grow in my job and move ahead .
__label__noemo	Plastic bags are widely used nowadays .
__label__joy	There's also a garden .
__label__noemo	Don't mention it .
__label__joy	You ’ Ve got a great personality .
__label__noemo	I see . Is it your first interview ?
__label__noemo	Oh , domestic things ? Yes , of course , we can help you with that .
__label__noemo	What do you have for breakfast ?
__label__noemo	Yes . People should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming.So it's called a watch .
__label__noemo	What ?
__label__noemo	Hi ! Bob , are you having problems with that ?
__label__noemo	Here ? And here ?
__label__noemo	Are you available for travel ?
__label__noemo	That would be nice . Let's call it a deal .
__label__noemo	OK , just fill in this application . You can sit over there . This brochure explains our services . We have free checking , and you will be given a debit card and on ATM card . There is no service
__label__noemo	On a cell phone ?
__label__noemo	I need help picking out a lotion .
__label__noemo	It always hurts . I hate going .
__label__noemo	What ’ s going on ?
__label__noemo	Too long , and you do not have much time .
__label__noemo	I am afraid that is not acceptable . Your contract says that you will deliver a product with a reject rate of less than six percent .
__label__noemo	It has never been worn . It was too small for me so I'm selling it .
__label__noemo	What ’ s your major weak point ?
__label__noemo	What university would you enter ?
__label__noemo	Well . I like the Thom Birds best .
__label__noemo	What makes is so great ?
__label__noemo	In South America , the most common language is Spanish and Portuguese .
__label__noemo	I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ...
__label__noemo	But Steven , you've called in sick 3 times during the last three weeks .
__label__noemo	Jogging , yoga , or even just taking a walk .
__label__noemo	I believe it will . It comes furnished . You can move in immediately after the lease is signed .
__label__noemo	It begins at 7 p . m ..
__label__noemo	Do you have a club card or will it be cash ?
__label__noemo	Well , Administrative assistant with shorthand and typing skills are badly needed here .
__label__noemo	Did you see the interview with Andy Lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I need some more cash for my visit in China . May I cash a traveler ’ s check here ?
__label__noemo	Any reasons ?
__label__joy	it's great ! Unfortunately , we're going to spend a fortune doing everything up .
__label__noemo	So , what experience do you have ?
__label__joy	It is OK with me . I enjoy being busy and learning new things .
__label__noemo	Besides , in the interview , it is best that you make corresponding adjustments to apply your prepared contents flexibly .
__label__noemo	It is really good news . How much do you earn a week now ?
__label__noemo	He knows a lot about law and he ’ s eloquent , too .
__label__noemo	Now tell me , what's your problem ?
__label__joy	Thank you , you helped me a lot .
__label__sadness	You know our boss always trying to save the last penny . We have to use up the equipment first .
__label__noemo	Okay . Let me think about this .
__label__noemo	I don't know .
__label__joy	I was thinking of maybe taking a drive to the beach .
__label__noemo	I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
__label__joy	Sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ?
__label__noemo	To conclude the deal , I'd say a reduction of at least 15 % would help .
__label__joy	Isn ’ t he the best instructor ? I think he ’ s so hot . Wow ! I really feel energized , don ’ t you ?
__label__noemo	Is Water Shrinking Festival official ?
__label__joy	It ’ s all so interesting . I ’ ll have to find more information about it on the internet . Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class .
__label__noemo	That ’ s right . I grew a beard during the trip , but I shaved it off when I came home .
__label__noemo	well , you have plenty of experience job hunting . I think you'd be the perfect person for the job !
__label__noemo	3 dollars .
__label__noemo	It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax .
__label__noemo	can't you hang out with them , too ?
__label__noemo	yes , for the most part . It doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments , anyway .
__label__noemo	I would like some light smell .
__label__noemo	And milk or orange juice ?
__label__noemo	I think otherwise . Even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by Elton John were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . And I would dare to say , it was too predictable .
__label__noemo	How did you meet your girlfriend ?
__label__joy	This is just what I've been looking for . Sign me up right away , please .
__label__noemo	Yes . The two sides declared a short ceasefire but it broke down earlier today . Several military target were destroyed by bombing . Many civilians were among the dead and wounded .
__label__noemo	Do you know how much they are paying her ?
__label__joy	Yeah , me too .
__label__noemo	Ok . This is your cubicle . At first , you ’ ll be responsible to me . Later , you ’ ll be working more independently .
__label__noemo	And I can experience another kind of life style .
__label__noemo	Oh shame ! I have a class tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Yes , but why does she have such a long face ?
__label__noemo	Well , the first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James . Once in the New World , they befriended an native named Squanto , who taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn .
__label__noemo	Is there any furniture ?
__label__joy	Sounds good .
__label__noemo	No problem at all , Mr Waterstone . Any preference as to how you want the money ?
__label__joy	Well , this is certainly a nice place , Mr . Taylor . What sort of public transportation is nearby ?
__label__noemo	Good afternoon . I have a reservation under the name of Hilton .
__label__noemo	What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
__label__noemo	It seems like a traffic accident .
__label__noemo	Please bring your baggage here for inspection .
__label__noemo	Hello ! Mr . Wang . this is Smith .
__label__noemo	When did you get your passport ?
__label__noemo	How about your new co-workers ?
__label__noemo	Rise and shine , sleepyhead .
__label__noemo	When are we leaving for our field trip ?
__label__noemo	How many departments do we have ?
__label__noemo	I ’ ll sing you a song .
__label__joy	I think you'll really like the food there .
__label__sadness	I feel terrible now .
__label__noemo	Sorry , tomato soup is not being served today , but we have egg soup , it's very delicious . Why don't you try it today ?
__label__noemo	This style came out last year , though . I like the dress , but I ’ m not sure whether last year ’ s fashions will be same this year .
__label__noemo	I am indeed . What can you tell me ?
__label__noemo	I am sorry to hear about that . Would you mind coming with me to my office and tell me exactly what happened here ?
__label__joy	It displays your slender figure , darling .
__label__noemo	That's fine . Have a nice day !
__label__noemo	Yes , all of us have naps .
__label__noemo	I received a letter asking me to come in and see you . I'm Mr Simons from Dalton's Electrics .
__label__noemo	All right . Here is the money .
__label__noemo	Quite well . I got my MA degree two weeks ago .
__label__noemo	All right . Make it a double , will you ?
__label__noemo	No , I wouldn't think so .
__label__noemo	Yes , I know my hair is quite thin.It runs in my family . Everybody has very thin hair .
__label__joy	It suits us fine . We ’ ll see you then .
__label__noemo	Yes . Nice to meet you !
__label__noemo	This is your song . I picked it for you .
__label__noemo	Really ? Is there ' Wall Street Journal ' , please ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to buy one of these refrigerators . Do I have to pay in cash ?
__label__noemo	No .
__label__noemo	What concoction are you making ?
__label__noemo	Well , sir . Can I take your measurements first ?
__label__noemo	Wait , will I have five insurances and one fund ?
__label__noemo	Well , nobody's perfect !
__label__noemo	Hello . 9-1- 1 . Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	I didn't know your sister lives in the city , when did she move there ?
__label__noemo	Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t really mind .
__label__noemo	Everything that came in off the fax machine last night is all on your desk . But I noticed that some of the faxes came through pretty blurred . Maybe you can take a look at them . If the copy is unreadable , I'll call them and ask them to relax .
__label__noemo	I don't know . Why don't you go ask for his autograph ?
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__joy	Oh , thank you for pointing that out . By the way , have you been following NBA for this season ?
__label__noemo	Oh , that would be too small .
__label__noemo	Oh , this is Monica
__label__noemo	Ok.But is there anything wrong ?
__label__noemo	888 Yuan per night . With breakfast . “ Northern Star ” buffet ! What's there arriving time ?
__label__noemo	Then I talked to her and got her number . You know what ? When you don't know what to say ? Just drink .
__label__noemo	You wanna take some time off , is that right ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I know it . I went through my last set of tires fast . I even had three flat tires in two weeks .
__label__noemo	Do you get much rain during the summer ?
__label__noemo	You should have a try .
__label__noemo	How much do you have budgeted for our trip to Las Angeles ?
__label__noemo	Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome !
__label__joy	You'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money .
__label__noemo	The disease fails to respond to drugs .
__label__noemo	You should strike while the iron is hot .
__label__joy	Not bad I guess . I just got back from Hawaii .
__label__noemo	I will go to bed early tonight .
__label__noemo	OK , I completely understand .
__label__noemo	Yes , do you have a table for five ?
__label__noemo	It's fine for most time of the day . But don't have tea before bedtime .
__label__noemo	I think you'll find I'm worth that .
__label__noemo	Why not ?
__label__joy	Wow ! AC wins . It is a close shave , you know .
__label__joy	Ok . Bye .
__label__noemo	I guess you could say that . What kind of games do you like ?
__label__noemo	I remember . What time do they need to be there ?
__label__noemo	I need your help , Bob .
__label__noemo	Front desk . May I help you ?
__label__noemo	What sports do you like to play ?
__label__noemo	Exactly . He is unbelievable .
__label__noemo	Are you OK ?
__label__noemo	Well , when you hear it change , that means you have an outside line . Where are you trying to call ?
__label__noemo	See you soon .
__label__noemo	Thank you for not asking me to collect the roaches in a jar as evidence .
__label__disgust	It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected .
__label__noemo	Bill , your work is too messy .
__label__noemo	Ok , I'll wait for you at 7pm at home . Anything else ?
__label__noemo	By the way , don't forget your luggage on the ship .
__label__noemo	I think so too . It's just pointless .
__label__noemo	I ’ m having a problem .
__label__noemo	It sounds OK . Then how do you pay the commission ?
__label__noemo	We ’ ll try our best , but you'd better prepare for the worst .
__label__noemo	Benter's Books .
__label__noemo	Well , they ' re not here . They are in the dustbin .
__label__noemo	Interesting . And , your postgraduate studies ?
__label__noemo	You shouldn ’ t stay up so late watching TV . I told you we had to get an early start .
__label__noemo	yeah , it's a must . Otherwise , I may miss important phone calls and text messages .
__label__noemo	You can get one in the grocery store over there .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'd like to buy a color TV .
__label__noemo	Helen gets on very well with her neighbors . I wouldn ’ t be surprised if they went to the party too .
__label__noemo	Julia , why have you prepared a candlelight dinner ? Anything special to celebrate ? Did you get a promotion ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , it costed a bundle alright .
__label__noemo	Hi , Ellen ! How is it going ?
__label__noemo	See you .
__label__noemo	Nice to meet you , Mr . Peter . I ’ m Wang Sian . I ’ Ve come for an interview as requested .
__label__joy	Ok , see you tonight ! Don ’ t be late !
__label__noemo	Yes , I am .
__label__noemo	OK . It falls on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month . It is said that there is a beautiful goddess Chang'E on the moon who had eaten some sort of elixir and had to depart her husband . She is always expecting to see her husband again . So , later we have the traditional idea that when there is the full moon , it is time for the family members to come together .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot . I hope to see you again .
__label__noemo	Hurry up , Benjamin ! Pass the ball to me . I'm good at shooting .
__label__joy	Good . I'll give you a call tonight .
__label__noemo	Okay . I chose this swimming suit . Do you like it ?
__label__noemo	Oh , and I can ’ t wait to watch the dragon dance ! Dad , can I sit on your shoulders this time ?
__label__noemo	Here ! Here ! Use my card !
__label__noemo	Oh , the day after tomorrow is Christmas .
__label__noemo	Uh ... Yeah ! I ’ Ve told you a thousand times that I ’ m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band .
__label__noemo	Do you have anything to declare ?
__label__noemo	Where is it now ?
__label__noemo	Don't worry.There ' re few cars now .
__label__joy	Why don't you ask them to buy you a PC ? You will soon use it at college .
__label__fear	I was scared stiff of giving my first performance .
__label__noemo	Sure , if I can
__label__noemo	That's okay . Well , let me think . How about a mystery novel ?
__label__noemo	You can find it in most restaurants , but the best place is certainly Quanjude Restaurant .
__label__noemo	Do you know if it costs any money to take it ?
__label__noemo	Perhaps we could go to the library festival that's going on at the local bookshop .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid this seat is taken .
__label__noemo	It's already on sale now .
__label__noemo	Oh , it's the Beijing 2008 Olympics ' Emblem . It's a Chinese seal , meaning that Chinese people warmly welcome the friends from all over the world .
__label__joy	Yes , a little breeze and a lovely moon .
__label__noemo	My main responsibility is trouble-shooting between top management and the general employees .
__label__noemo	How is it ? Did you learn anything here ? Why are you taking it again ?
__label__noemo	Yup , and you can keep the money in your pocket .
__label__noemo	I'm an apprentice with a local engineering firm . My training lasts for two years . Two days a week I study Engineering at a local college . If I pass all my exams , I hope the company will take me on as an engineer .
__label__noemo	It's 86 coach and 175 berths
__label__noemo	You can keep it until the addressee tells you that the letter has been delivered . It is the proof that you sent the letter if it fails to arrive .
__label__noemo	Just some water , please . Do you have any ointment for my nose ? It feels so itchy after blowing my nose so much .
__label__joy	It can't be true .
__label__noemo	Just a minute please .
__label__joy	Wow , Amy , look at that number .
__label__joy	Yes , I will have a cup of coffee .
__label__noemo	A movie ? Sure . Do you know what's on right now ?
__label__noemo	Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped.Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk .
__label__noemo	It's an open book that it was stolen by the man in black .
__label__noemo	I ’ d really rather not . I ’ ll be too tempted to buy something that I can ’ t afford !
__label__joy	That's all right.Would you have a cup of coffee ?
__label__noemo	nothing really . I think I've had a few too many coffees .
__label__noemo	Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers .
__label__noemo	Wow . You ’ re really a heavy smoker .
__label__noemo	Speaking of plane tickets , don't forget to check on the reservations !
__label__noemo	Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
__label__noemo	Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see .
__label__noemo	That's what I ate yesterday .
__label__noemo	Is the bus ride long ?
__label__noemo	That's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased .
__label__noemo	How much is the fare ?
__label__noemo	I like reading novels about early America .
__label__noemo	Anything else , sir ?
__label__noemo	I accidentally ripped the cover .
__label__noemo	Is this the right counter to check in for this flight ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m fine . Thank you .
__label__noemo	Why such a big difference ?
__label__noemo	Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ?
__label__sadness	Well . I am breaking up with Cathy .
__label__noemo	of course . The fitting room is right over there .
__label__noemo	I need to stand behind this shield . Now you will take a deep breath , hold it , and let it out .
__label__noemo	We need the best possible quality .
__label__noemo	Who are those kids walking down the aisle ?
__label__noemo	How about one little hint ?
__label__noemo	I know what you mean . How much would you like to deposit with us today ?
__label__sadness	Don't mention it . The thesis due date is coming , but my thesis isn't even close to being done .
__label__surprise	What are you talking about ? My alarm hasn ’ t even gone off yet .
__label__anger	I'll never again come to your side ; I am turn away now and can't return .
__label__noemo	can I ask why ? Were you unhappy working for us ?
__label__noemo	The Blacks got divorced .
__label__noemo	You mean the seventy seventh ? It's not far from here . You can walk there .
__label__joy	I'm very well , thank you.How are you ?
__label__noemo	Did you have any kind of punishment in your life and studies ?
__label__noemo	Joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? Let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ?
__label__noemo	Dancing figures are quite popular . Two of the boxes have them .
__label__joy	Great , thanks .
__label__noemo	Stop , stop ... We are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . Maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , but I'm looking for a gift for my friend .
__label__noemo	This looks great . When was it built ?
__label__noemo	OK ! We'll see it .
__label__noemo	Now that I think of it , three days is better than seven .
__label__noemo	Almost . There are a lot of polar animals sea birds , such as seals , whales and penguins , People don't get much chance of seeing them .
__label__noemo	It should be under Steve Johnson .
__label__noemo	It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things .
__label__noemo	We have tickets for the matinee . It starts at 3p . m .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t ! Stay the course ! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful . I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice .
__label__noemo	Sure . How about this one ?
__label__noemo	I've just been reading an article about them.they ' ll be used for all sorts of things now .
__label__noemo	I usually try to go to bed around 11
__label__joy	You know , my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for twenty years . It drove my mom crazy !
__label__joy	Congratulations !
__label__noemo	Aren't you tired ?
__label__noemo	I need a table for two for tonight .
__label__noemo	Last trip was very terrible . I hope everything will be fine this time . Don ’ t blow it .
__label__noemo	Oh , certainly . I'm Linda , the Manager . I can help you with that . How many will there be in your party ?
__label__noemo	I need to copy some pages in my book .
__label__noemo	That was a thirtieth birthday present . You can have it if you want .
__label__noemo	Right . I have lots of time to think carefully before I make my final decision .
__label__noemo	It's not so long really . What class are you in ? Intermediate or ... ?
__label__noemo	I kind of don't want to leave any tip for the lousy service we received .
__label__noemo	Thanks .
__label__noemo	My stomach is bothering me .
__label__noemo	Can you make a suit for me to measure ?
__label__noemo	Right here . It ’ s for that new fax machine we ’ re getting .
__label__noemo	I usually play chess with my friends . But I like playing basketball best .
__label__noemo	Those are something gifts I bought for my friends .
__label__noemo	Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ’ s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid you can't smoke here .
__label__noemo	Can you tell me the best way to look for an apartment ?
__label__noemo	It was for two o ’ clock in the afternoon .
__label__noemo	Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ?
__label__noemo	Can I be of any help to you ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m so relieved that your ankle wasn ’ t broken ! I feel just awful about this whole thing . I wanna make it up to you . Let me take you out to dinner tonight . My treat .
__label__noemo	No , I hate swimming . I prefer playing tennis .
__label__noemo	I attend an aerobic class three times a week .
__label__noemo	Perhaps she makes about 25 knots an hour .
__label__joy	Ok . I ’ ll miss you . I hope we can see each other again soon .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I hate sitting in the front row .
__label__noemo	Give me five more minutes . I'm really tired this morning .
__label__noemo	Don't take it too hard . There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010 .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I'd better head for home .
__label__noemo	A / S / L , IGP , H & K , and ZZZ . What the hell do they mean ?
__label__noemo	Let me see . There ’ s the news section , the entertainment section , sports , business , and world affairs .
__label__noemo	I really don't know .
__label__joy	Great ! It's good to see you . Goodbye !
__label__noemo	Hello , my old friend . Long time no see . How are you doing ?
__label__joy	That's right
__label__noemo	When I finish , what should I do then ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I don't need to do that . I'll be staying with friends
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	Thanks for everything .
__label__noemo	See you .
__label__noemo	Of course , here you are . These are Black tea from Anti , Oolong tea from Guangdong , Oolong tea from Fujisan and Longing tea from Xinu . The new products are Curls Black tea , Crushed Black tea and so on . They are the best sellers in many countries .
__label__noemo	That ’ s a good idea
__label__noemo	Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee .
__label__noemo	You can get cheap carpets easily . Another idea is to buy a rug . That would cover a lot of the carpet and you wouldn ’ t have to replace the carpet . It would save you a lot of work .
__label__noemo	I like thrillers and I like Julia Roberts , so it might be interesting . I read a review today and the critic didn ’ t seem to be very impressed .
__label__noemo	You need to apply for a passport .
__label__noemo	Do I have to change ?
__label__noemo	No , that thought doesn't cross my mind .
__label__noemo	No , thanks . I'm fine .
__label__noemo	The private room , please .
__label__noemo	Uh , I can see that . And Erica Falls has lost a lot of weight .
__label__noemo	I always feel I ’ m left high and dry with nobody to rely on .
__label__joy	Of course ! That's why I always say , Eat , drink and be Greek !
__label__noemo	Well , I've grown to like second-hand things . I wouldn't have gotten through university without them !
__label__noemo	Yes , it's great for cleaning up spills .
__label__noemo	I was hoping to talk to you about the sales projections for next year . I ’ m having a little trouble figuring out how to use the spreadsheet you set up for me . It has a lot of complicated form
__label__noemo	That's true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount .
__label__noemo	Yes , of course .
__label__noemo	I have been a Production Manager .
__label__noemo	Shirley , do you know today's homework from our economic law class ? I have written it on a piece of paper but I can't find it now .
__label__noemo	I believe we are all out of food .
__label__noemo	You two are so health-conscious !
__label__noemo	Well ... that's a long story .
__label__noemo	Waiter , bill , please .
__label__noemo	Is it far ?
__label__noemo	You paid the last time , because I didn't have any money , remember ?
__label__noemo	Then , what's your countr-offer ?
__label__joy	If you have any good jobs , keep an eye for me !
__label__noemo	Let's go quickly .
__label__noemo	Be quiet . He is singing .
__label__noemo	No . Can I have my money back ?
__label__noemo	Are we going to have dinner tonight ?
__label__noemo	Do I need to take a bus ?
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	I'd like to check in , PLS .
__label__noemo	I already knew that .
__label__noemo	What time does the train for Boston leave ?
__label__joy	Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate .
__label__noemo	What's your nationality ?
__label__noemo	OK , which car do you want me to put them in ?
__label__noemo	Hello . This is Bell Canada . How can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Was it your intention to kill the victim ?
__label__noemo	That bill should have been mailed about two weeks ago .
__label__noemo	Here you go .
__label__noemo	Dad . You're so cute . What do I need to do to help get ready ?
__label__noemo	I think the guarantee's just run out . Let me check . Oh , it's OK . We took out an extended warranty , it runs until next March .
__label__joy	Don ’ t be mean . Look here come the bridesmaids ! Their dresses look beautiful !
__label__noemo	Yes . My wife and I are interested in renting a house for the summer .
__label__noemo	I went all over the world . It was the best year of my life . Where did you go to school ?
__label__noemo	How do you want to spend your old age ?
__label__noemo	Of course , Mr . Green .
__label__noemo	Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take No . 105 which will let you right off in front of the zoo gate .
__label__noemo	I'm starving ! It would be truly appreciated if you bought me a burrito .
__label__joy	It's a good diet and a regular exercise .
__label__noemo	But I like cold more than hot .
__label__noemo	Yes , I would .
__label__noemo	Mike ? How can you trust him to help us ?
__label__noemo	How do I use this adhesive ?
__label__noemo	I suppose I'm a reasonable student . I passed all my tests and enjoyed studying subjects that interested me .
__label__surprise	Whoa .
__label__noemo	Should we invite the whole committee or should we just have the sub-committee there ?
__label__noemo	What I need to know is how I can keep track of what's going on . I mean , some days I buy and sell quite a lot . Some days , there's no activity at all .
__label__noemo	That ’ s right . I ’ Ve never really liked it since I got here .
__label__noemo	I guess you get what you pay for .
__label__noemo	Yes , it's me .
__label__noemo	It's time for you to wake up .
__label__noemo	Sorry , just a moment . The name is Caxton ...
__label__noemo	Excuse me , would you like a drink before your meal ?
__label__noemo	I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . Could you recommend something around 300 ?
__label__anger	What ? You're overcharging me !
__label__noemo	Oh . You took the wrong bus . You need to take Bus 151 which goes the opposite direction .
__label__noemo	I'm taking a date to a restaurant , so could you please direct me to a good one ?
__label__noemo	C :: I ’ d like to have this roll of film developed .
__label__sadness	That's too bad . What problems are you having .
__label__noemo	You look really wiped out .
__label__anger	But you should have told me you were in love with her .
__label__noemo	I see , sir . This one is very good .
__label__noemo	You know , if I can keep up my workouts , I think I have a chance in 2004 .
__label__joy	Me too . Please write to me as soon as you get Boston .
__label__noemo	What else is there at the EDD offices that can help me with my job search ?
__label__surprise	No kidding ! I can't believe this . You devil !
__label__noemo	Well , you're lucky that you're still able to make your payments . I missed a credit payment last month . Now my bank account's overdrawn , and the company is threatening to take back my purchases .
__label__joy	Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren .
__label__noemo	Has Mien sold his house yet ?
__label__noemo	I'm planning on going , but I really need her to give me my invitation .
__label__surprise	The answer is zero ! What a let-down !
__label__noemo	I'd like to make a reservation to Los Angels for next Monday .
__label__joy	Thank you . I just got this outfit the other day .
__label__noemo	That's no problem . Is it cash ?
__label__joy	Anything for you . Seriously , I don ’ t mind helping .
__label__noemo	That's too expensive for me .
__label__noemo	Do you have a reservation ?
__label__noemo	Don't you think it's a sheer waste of both time and money ?
__label__joy	What a good goal !
__label__noemo	Is that why it won't turn on ?
__label__noemo	Thanks . Have you got any light bulbs ?
__label__noemo	I'll tell you what . You can get a motorcycle on one condition .
__label__noemo	Yes , two of my cousins live here and my aunt and uncle live about 30 miles from here .
__label__noemo	I got a replace my party outfit , I trashed it last week .
__label__joy	Yes , That's him over there - the taller , handsome one . Would you let me introduce you ?
__label__noemo	How long did the convulsion last ?
__label__noemo	Did you call me , sir ?
__label__noemo	Wait a minute . You're a Comp Lit major ?
__label__noemo	OK . Is the plane on schedule ?
__label__noemo	No one has ever tried to show me how to play a sport before.Maybe I should learn to do something .
__label__noemo	Remind him to give you a locker tomorrow .
__label__noemo	what are you listening to ? Is that Beethoven or Mozart ?
__label__noemo	Do you prefer imported ones or domestic ones ?
__label__noemo	it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .
__label__noemo	What are your plans now that you ’ re getting out ?
__label__joy	thanks , I will . I'll see you tomorrow then !
__label__noemo	I'm looking for some earrings for my wife as a wedding anniversary gift .
__label__joy	Thank you , Bob ! This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many , a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world . In Switzerland , a major avalanche was reported in the Alps . Fortunately , no one was injured . Due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the US Midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled .
__label__noemo	I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better .
__label__noemo	For this position we prefer e-resume at the very beginning . Please send it to our department ’ s e-mail box .
__label__joy	OK . I'll turn it on .
__label__noemo	You ’ re almost 70 years old , Mom ! Don ’ t you think it would be better for you if you moved in with us ?
__label__noemo	Sure , what's up ?
__label__sadness	That girl was my cousin .
__label__noemo	Sure , I will . What about the minutes ? Do you think I am responsible for that too ?
__label__noemo	His number's 4945939 .
__label__noemo	Not at all . Take a seat . Now , what can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Room service , what can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Did you just get your review or something ?
__label__joy	Congratulations ! I heard that you are going to take a two-week training course in the headquarter .
__label__noemo	Are the reports favorable ?
__label__noemo	Uh well ... would you like the bad news first or the really bad news ?
__label__joy	The exhibits are really special . I enjoy the paintings very much .
__label__noemo	I think I may rent this apartment from you .
__label__noemo	Hello , is there anything I can do for you ?
__label__noemo	What currency will you have ?
__label__noemo	I see . We have various rental periods . How long would you like to rent it for ?
__label__joy	Great , the lamb stew tastes incredible .
__label__noemo	Do you take care of them everyday ?
__label__noemo	No , I wasn't . I came here in 1992 .
__label__joy	I love you , too , Dad . Bye .
__label__noemo	what's your favorite Chinese dish ?
__label__noemo	Why are you going out with Andy ?
__label__noemo	Ok . Does he know your number ?
__label__joy	Great , I'll take one .
__label__noemo	The second one told me that the job information was released half a year ago , and had been overdue .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t like the pointed toes . Let me take a look at what else you have . Too high . That one looks like the back would cut into my heel . I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly . I don ’ t want bows . I find slingbacks very uncomfortable . Those might as well be stilettos . Too modern . Ah , finally , this is what I ’ m looking for .
__label__noemo	Yes . May I help you ?
__label__noemo	No , I didn't .
__label__noemo	Now that would be hard to live without . We city folks are pretty spoiled .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I don ’ t have to pay for a space on the street .
__label__noemo	You mean used cars ?
__label__noemo	Twenty-one .
__label__noemo	Well , I guess I will have to drive back down then . Hmm . I didn't think of that .
__label__noemo	Will she need anything besides what's in this box ?
__label__noemo	Do you go to the cinema a lot ?
__label__noemo	But it costs an arm and leg .
__label__noemo	Each of both .
__label__noemo	Poor John ! He is bothering both sides of this bread .
__label__noemo	$ 1 . You can get your photos instantly .
__label__noemo	I'm with Hartford public relations . I'd like to set up an appointment to come by and talk with you about our services .
__label__noemo	You know why fire crackers are set off in festival .
__label__joy	Hi , Celia ! How was your trip to the United States ?
__label__noemo	What else does he say ?
__label__joy	That'll be fine .
__label__joy	It's my favorite .
__label__noemo	Can you tell me how long it will take them to get back to me ?
__label__noemo	Don ’ t you know that she was the only one who had received the invitation in the office ?
__label__noemo	Better , thank you , doctor .
__label__noemo	Bye
__label__joy	Good-bye .
__label__noemo	Wait a moment . It seems that your letter is overweight . Let me weight it .
__label__noemo	People drive on the right in China .
__label__joy	That's very good !
__label__noemo	You had gone to the moon twice , orbited space around the Earth lots of times , and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have . How long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness ? I just can't wait .
__label__noemo	Oh great ! We've been waiting for those . Is everything alright with them ?
__label__noemo	Your father looks much younger in the picture .
__label__noemo	Fine , madam . When will Mr . Brent be arriving , and how many nights will he be staying ?
__label__noemo	I work in marketing . I'm a regional marketing manager for an IT company . Normally , I work out of Beijing , but I'm here on business . My friend Judy over there , she lives here and she invited me to this party . And you ? How about you ?
__label__noemo	No , I didn't . Really !
__label__joy	Thank you . Please bring us a bottle of dry white wine .
__label__noemo	Try to keep cool . It's not an easy take .
__label__noemo	Yes , please .
__label__noemo	Maybe you should talk to the teacher .
__label__noemo	Go down this road and then turn left .
__label__noemo	But it matches my major .
__label__noemo	Who is the next ?
__label__noemo	Well , I guess if you are Sigrid and Roy you can keep a tiger or lion . I guess all types of things don't they .
__label__noemo	But there are a lot of Kts in this town . There's one just two blocks from here .
__label__noemo	Does this mean that you have bad news for me ?
__label__noemo	And the holdall has some fragile items inside , so please be careful with that too .
__label__noemo	Yeah , you're going to have to call them and get them to be re-faxed . These copies are so dark , I can't make out any of the words .
__label__noemo	I took out a life insurance policy and made my wife the beneficiary .
__label__joy	Well , as the saying goes – we aim to please !
__label__noemo	What's wrong ?
__label__noemo	They run about every five minutes .
__label__noemo	Well , I feel a little tired .
__label__noemo	No , their cards are for sale .
__label__joy	Yeah , well , that was some good advice . You made some really good points .
__label__noemo	Sounds like a plan .
__label__noemo	How many pieces of luggage would you like to check in , sir ?
__label__anger	Peter ! Pack them . Don't read them .
__label__noemo	I usually go on holiday during the spring or the autumn . I try to go somewhere where the weather is more reliable than in my city .
__label__noemo	It can ’ t be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it .
__label__noemo	That's true .
__label__noemo	In a couple of days , I was told .
__label__noemo	Can I borrow this magazine from you ? It's really interesting and I can't put it down .
__label__noemo	Would you like us to deliver the mattress for you , sir ?
__label__noemo	I have no idea what you're talking about .
__label__noemo	I'd like to confirm a reservation , please.My name is Wang Lin . My flight is KF98 .
__label__noemo	Ok , is that all ?
__label__noemo	What price do you suggest for 300,000 sets of Article No . 2323 with London as the destination port ?
__label__noemo	May I know the reason , madam ?
__label__noemo	Oh , no ! What about your presentation today ?
__label__noemo	Not rally . 200 years ago , it was just a small insignificant village .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry to hear that . Take care of yourself .
__label__noemo	Do you do morning exercises ?
__label__joy	OK . Thanks .
__label__noemo	Maybe you could hire me on trial , if I ’ m not qualified for this position , you can let me go .
__label__joy	I ’ m glad to hear that you are so excited .
__label__noemo	At least you ’ re doing your part . My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family .
__label__noemo	Yes . Don ’ t you ?
__label__noemo	It feels all right.But if it were a darker color , I'd like it better.This seems too light for winter.Do you think you could get me one ?
__label__noemo	On 20th May 1963 .
__label__noemo	You look upset , anything wrong ?
__label__noemo	No , I don't like black . What have you got in brown ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me . May I see that laptop for a moment ?
__label__noemo	Please , call me John .
__label__noemo	There won't be anyone there to appreciate how cute you are .
__label__noemo	Some of his early films are hard to find nowadays , especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
__label__joy	I am sure I can get a 95 this time .
__label__noemo	No , it's already included in your room fare .
__label__noemo	Yes , of course . Here it is .
__label__noemo	Fine . We will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control .
__label__noemo	I've never used this place before.Can you give me some idea what I need to do ?
__label__noemo	Do you think it'll work ?
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__joy	Oh , yes , I like that one , but it's too heavy .
__label__noemo	What ’ s next ?
__label__joy	It is Europe's spotless land of lakes and mountains ! Let me know as soon as you can so we can get a discount .
__label__anger	I got carried away . I made such a fool of myself . They were both laughing at me !
__label__noemo	That might be a little too much , but we ’ ll see how it goes .
__label__noemo	Frank ’ s getting married , do you believe this ?
__label__noemo	Let me see ... yes , 15,880 NT . After the discount , your total comes to 12,704 NT . Here's your free teddy bear , free panties and your card application .
__label__noemo	How many nights a week is it ?
__label__noemo	They did .
__label__noemo	Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ?
__label__noemo	My car broke down .
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Who is this young man ?
__label__noemo	Yes , there is .
__label__noemo	Do you have the ' The man and the Sea ' by Ernest Hemingway ?
__label__noemo	Right . Here is five hundred yuan in advance . Is it enough ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I ’ Ve been there several times on business trips . But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city .
__label__joy	Relax , it was just a goat !
__label__joy	Well yes , but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . It's OK here . It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there .
__label__noemo	For my credit worthiness ?
__label__noemo	It might be . You'll have to go see for yourself .
__label__noemo	Yes . We ’ Ve taken care of all of that . We decided not to get married in a church though . Neither of us is very religious .
__label__noemo	Pay attention to keeping eye contact as well .
__label__noemo	May I see your receipt ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I ’ m sorry . I forgot about those completely . I ’ ll bring them by your office .
__label__noemo	I could help pay for it .
__label__noemo	I don't believe you .
__label__noemo	Yes , I have a very special one . I will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . A friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . I was very interested . So I asked him to get me the application form . Lucky , my application was approved by the manager very soon .
__label__surprise	Hello , Jack ! Fancy meeting you here !
__label__noemo	OK , here you are .
__label__noemo	Sure , Tuesday ’ s perfect . May I ask where you ’ re calling from ?
__label__noemo	You have to do something romantic .
__label__noemo	Mr . Carter has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the Shangri-La Hotel at 7:00 this evening . Here's an invitation for you .
__label__noemo	Let me have a look . Everything I do I do it for you 、 Unchained melody 、 My heart will go on . Oh , and I ’ d like to try Everything I do I do it for you .
__label__noemo	You've met her before , haven't you ?
__label__noemo	Yet in writing , George has nothing on Frank .
__label__joy	It's a good thing . OK , let's go skiing .
__label__noemo	Excuse me ? Let's try to work this out , okay ?
__label__joy	Thank you , Mr . Cooper . I hope we get the contract .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes . Several of the buildings from the villages still survive . Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . There was a castle near one village , so our city has a castle too .
__label__noemo	That's good . Could I please see the originals of everything ?
__label__noemo	I ’ d like to go into management . I ’ Ve applied for several jobs already and I ’ m hopeful that I ’ ll get some job offers . How about you ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , it reminds you why they say baseball is America ’ s favorite pastime .
__label__noemo	Oh , you don ’ t usually have a starter ?
__label__noemo	Could we borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend ?
__label__noemo	How was your morning jog ?
__label__noemo	Good morning , Miss.Are there boat tickets to Miami on the first of September
__label__noemo	Oh , come on . Jane is a very nice girl , someone you meet only once till lifetime .
__label__noemo	I already have something to wear .
__label__noemo	I told you so .
__label__noemo	Well , I don't have an Ethernet port . My computer runs entirely on wireless service .
__label__noemo	Look on the rack to your right .
__label__noemo	Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record .
__label__noemo	Mr.Smith called just now that he had to fly to Shanghai on urgent business today .
__label__noemo	I see . We grow a lot of fruit and vegetables in my country . We export a lot of melons , grapes , oranges and lemons . In your country , do you eat corn on the cob ? It's very popular in my country .
__label__surprise	Really ? I can't say I agree .
__label__joy	Oh , I see . Thank you .
__label__joy	It sounds like he is madly in love with you . Are you ready for such a serious relationship ?
__label__noemo	No , double B for Bravo

__label__noemo	I will give a call .
__label__noemo	Busy with your work again ?
__label__joy	In my parking lot , at 2pm .
__label__noemo	With the cut I'll give you , we will minimize a lot of that .
__label__noemo	Oh where was that ?
__label__surprise	It ’ s great . Although his father didn ’ t agree with that , Tom went through with it .
__label__noemo	How's your current job going ?
__label__surprise	What ? So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game ? What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore ? What are you playing ?
__label__noemo	Hi , is that Mr . Wu ?
__label__noemo	No , you don't .
__label__noemo	There's a Kentucky's not far ahead and there's a McDonald's in down street .
__label__sadness	That's true . My bad for not calling .
__label__noemo	You will have to take your driving test . Have you taken it yet ?
__label__joy	Great ! So I'll know who to call if I ever need a lawyer .
__label__noemo	A vet-a veterinary surgeon .
__label__noemo	I prefer time deposit .
__label__noemo	No way . Her old man is rich . He buys her anything she wants .
__label__noemo	Isn ’ t London hot in the summer ?
__label__noemo	I know many stores have that policy . But I have returned sale items here before .
__label__noemo	School , you mean ? Yes , he does . He likes his teachers , and that always makes difference .
__label__joy	Sounds good to me .
__label__noemo	This is a nice place , but you need to get some furniture .
__label__noemo	Believe it or not , the interviewers are as interested in your questions as they are in your answers .
__label__noemo	Hold the line , please . I'll put your call through .
__label__noemo	Most willingly . It's 600 dollars per ton .
__label__noemo	I just want a private conversation with one other person .
__label__noemo	Did you ask his former secretary , Lora ? She knows a lot about him .
__label__joy	Do more exercises after you are healthy .
__label__noemo	I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . It's a real letdown .
__label__joy	My pleasure , and have a good time !
__label__noemo	Beer , please . Oh , there are so many dishes .
__label__anger	Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at .
__label__noemo	What about roses ?
__label__noemo	Yes , please , I'll need a ride . I'll be waiting for you then .
__label__joy	I felt as if I had been in a different world .
__label__joy	Its 3D animation is attractive and its colorful scenes are also unforgettable .
__label__noemo	did you always do well at school ?
__label__noemo	Do I need stamps ?
__label__noemo	Well , I prefer yogurt to all the other drinks . Have you ever tried a kind of yogurt with old milk in it ? It tastes great and very healthy too .
__label__noemo	What color do you like ?
__label__noemo	They give me no help at all .
__label__noemo	Hello , sir . Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	So what kind of music turns you on ?
__label__joy	Very well , thanks .
__label__noemo	But if you were me ?
__label__joy	Thank you just the same .
__label__noemo	Yes ?
__label__noemo	I want to have a try later .
__label__noemo	And ?
__label__noemo	Which film shall we see ?
__label__joy	I was looking forward to your arrival .
__label__noemo	It is 150 dollars each .
__label__surprise	Wow , and all the key points are included in them ? You're so smart !
__label__noemo	Hey , How's it going ?
__label__noemo	Oh , do you want to play sometime ?
__label__noemo	I'm sure it will , if we are appointed your agent . Your garments are attractive , and we , a well-established importer with multiple sales channels , can boost the sales .
__label__joy	I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ?
__label__noemo	120 British pounds . But there are still three days left in the auction . If you want it , you'll have to bid . Do you have the guts ?
__label__joy	Sounds great , i ' d very much like having something thanks , when ?
__label__noemo	Because I want to study english literature . but I think chemistry is better for getting a job .
__label__noemo	My father wants me to work as a trainee in his company .
__label__noemo	Your stereo is better than mine . Do you mind if we use yours ?
__label__noemo	This is she . Paul ?
__label__noemo	I can try to get the book from a different library .
__label__noemo	Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive .
__label__noemo	I'd be happy to write one for you .
__label__noemo	Is she chubby ?
__label__joy	I've had a delightful time and I really appreciate your spending so much time showing me the sights .
__label__noemo	You can find an airsick bag in the seat pocket in front of you .
__label__noemo	I see.Is it your first interview ?
__label__noemo	I believe there are still two Psychology classes open .
__label__noemo	You can come in this afternoon . If you would feel better , bring your husband with you .
__label__joy	This is going to surprise you , but I'm happy . I think you're making the right move .
__label__disgust	All right . But these are black and I don ’ t like black shoes . They ’ re dull .
__label__noemo	3 weeks .
__label__noemo	Nancy , please turn the TV down .
__label__noemo	I want one pound of ground beef .
__label__noemo	But I want to watch TV now .
__label__noemo	I highly doubt it . Your girlfriend is Chinese .
__label__noemo	It ’ s sent to Mr . Charles . I believe he is in London .
__label__noemo	I have been working 70 hours this week . I am totally maxed out .
__label__noemo	Hello Mike . How are things going for you ?
__label__noemo	Then ...
__label__joy	I can't wait until we get our year-end bonus !
__label__noemo	It's not the right material . Or the right color . I can't possibly accept it .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , sir . Flight GB105 is one to Milan , are you sure of your change ?
__label__noemo	The 486 .
__label__noemo	You said you never went to hospital .
__label__noemo	Because I went out .
__label__noemo	But that's better than keeping everything to yourself . You've got to let her know . Come on ! You've got to take a chance ! Even though you are rejected , it's not the end of the world ! There's nothing to lose , is there ?
__label__joy	Well . Thanks any way
__label__noemo	I hope not but it will take at least three hours .
__label__noemo	Wow , this's sinking a hole .
__label__noemo	I like studying English , and I can read well , but speaking can be difficult .
__label__noemo	It's 7388-2424- 3535-1818 and the expiration is 05/08 .
__label__noemo	They're over by the oatmeal and the breakfast bars .
__label__noemo	It's whatever you're planning on cooking .
__label__noemo	If I take a short job and then get laid off , will I be starting over trying to get unemployment ?
__label__noemo	well , first of all , it ’ s much bigger . It has the same number of rooms , but each room is larger . We also have a larger garden , which our dog loves , of course !
__label__noemo	Well , I admit I always do business on the safe side . Could you let me have your proposal then ?
__label__noemo	It's very good , and the result isn't too bad .
__label__noemo	And so , that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year . Thank you very much for your time .
__label__noemo	From one to two .
__label__joy	No wonder you always look so active .
__label__noemo	How did you do on your BELTS exam ?
__label__noemo	Well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . That's the best we can do . What do you think of that ?
__label__noemo	Do you think it fits me ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment .
__label__noemo	Yeah ! He ’ s very good at showing off his knowledge .
__label__noemo	I'd like to introduce myself first .
__label__noemo	Thanks doc , bye !
__label__noemo	How could I get there ?
__label__noemo	Well , actually I prefer something a bit bigger if that's possible .
__label__noemo	It seems that working in a foreign enterprise is not the same as I expected . Thank you for your help .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'm hungry . What types of food sound good ?
__label__noemo	So Emily , do you still want to see a movie together this weekend ?
__label__noemo	200yuan . I bought a computer online , so I have to pay the mortgage .
__label__noemo	We can be so critical of one another .
__label__noemo	I think there must be .
__label__noemo	make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions .
__label__noemo	We're just looking for a reasonable price according to the specifications in our project blueprint . That's all I can say .
__label__noemo	Well , I ... I lost my wallet , and I ...
__label__noemo	What packages do you have ?
__label__noemo	Did you pass it the first time that you took it ?
__label__noemo	So , what did you win ?
__label__noemo	No ! Not at all . But , I did find out they have more than one position with different clients , so at least one would probably work .
__label__noemo	Good evening . We want a dinning room with a table for eight .
__label__noemo	I think it will be .
__label__noemo	How long will it take for my passport to be ready ?
__label__joy	Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together .
__label__noemo	Did you pass the test your first try ?
__label__noemo	You are funny !
__label__noemo	I'm sorry , but I've got an important job to do .
__label__joy	I like your sweater . It suits you very well .
__label__noemo	It seems to me that now you're famous . You've got to go out and be seen at the right places and go to the right parties .
__label__noemo	Someone busted my window .
__label__noemo	He is afraid of his father-in-law .
__label__noemo	No , there's no double six at the end of the number . It's just zero , double seven , eight , seven , three , six , seven , six , double eight .
__label__noemo	Why are you so excited ?
__label__joy	well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides .
__label__noemo	did you write a clear objective in your resume ?
__label__joy	Is that so ? I'm glad you enjoyed it .
__label__noemo	It depends . So you must be careful buying second-hand goods .
__label__noemo	He has a mustache , if I remember correctly , and a light complexion .
__label__noemo	I see . How much will that cost ?
__label__surprise	My God ! I actually checked them one by one . How could this be ?
__label__noemo	I really appreciate that .
__label__noemo	You talked like the Terminator for two months ? Wow , I think you liked that movie even more than I liked ' Titanic . ' Why did you like ' Terminator ' so much ?
__label__noemo	You can call direct if you like .
__label__noemo	I'm quite out of thoughts recently .
__label__noemo	She has keen to buy something which is much cheaper .
__label__noemo	Yes , why not ? Don ’ t you like ETV ?
__label__noemo	how do you think you did ?
__label__noemo	Is the new computerised stock system in operation ?
__label__noemo	I was in the bank during the robbery .
__label__noemo	Is this a promise ?
__label__noemo	Exactly five dollars .
__label__noemo	It could be that , or maybe you are eating too many sweets . In any case , I ’ ll administer an anesthetic and you won ’ t feel a thing !
__label__joy	Exactly , which is why a three-bedroom is better . And look , there are two bathrooms .
__label__noemo	Cindy , you're so cute .
__label__noemo	For 1,200 yuan to Nanchang , the commission is 12 yuan .
__label__noemo	My name is Rudy Randolph . I'm at 818-555-1234 . The reservation was for April 9 .
__label__noemo	That's no problem . Let me see ... You still have ten days annual leave left , is that right ?
__label__joy	My uncle gave me this bicycle as a birthday present . Look !
__label__noemo	I laughed up my sleeves at him . He ’ s seen his girlfriend off at the airport and had lipstick on his face and did not know it .
__label__noemo	Yes , he does but when he was driving up here last night he had an accident and was taken to hospital . So I am doing it instead . Mary , Must you go out tonight ? Couldn ’ t you get out of it ?
__label__joy	Great , I like the idea of trying some new food .
__label__noemo	May I open one of those ? Let me taste it .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	Would you mind showing me how to use it ?
__label__noemo	"Let me have a look at your throat first . Please open your mouth and say "" ah "" ."
__label__noemo	Please don't tell my mom .
__label__noemo	OK . I wonder about the rate of interest of the account .
__label__noemo	Yes , my sister loves his personality .
__label__noemo	I prefer something like this one - a touring bike , but it is more expensive .
__label__noemo	Hi , this is Monica . I was wondering when we can work on this financial report .
__label__noemo	I agree with you in this way . But how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?
__label__noemo	Would you rather I taught him a lesson for you ?
__label__joy	Oh , I love the roof tiles on Spanish style houses .
__label__noemo	May I take a bus or a taxi to get there ?
__label__joy	Hi there Mr . Anderson ! How are you on this fine morning ?
__label__noemo	How do you do ? My name is James Green .
__label__noemo	Well . First , make meaning clear by using concise forma language . Second , describe accurately the exact requirement . Finally , state clearly the permissible variation in quantity .
__label__noemo	Have you decided on anything ?
__label__noemo	Back to live with my parents . That's something else I used to do before we were married . Remember ?
__label__noemo	Should I clean the windshield for you ?
__label__noemo	Have you seen this ?
__label__joy	Sure thing , follow me . This here is the .
__label__noemo	I was in my friend's room , talking for an hour or so .
__label__noemo	Because I ’ m not in the mood , that ’ s why .
__label__joy	Sure , a promise is a promise .
__label__noemo	The regular price is $ 2980.00 , but until December the 31st it ′ s on sale for just $ 2,699 . 00 .
__label__noemo	No , I can only carry on a simple conversation in French .
__label__sadness	But I probably can't afford it . It must be really expensive .
__label__noemo	Is this the front desk ?
__label__noemo	So , did I tell you about my New Year ’ s resolution ? I ’ Ve decided to go on a diet .
__label__noemo	Anything else ?
__label__surprise	From a sweet ma ? ! It's not worth it . Plus , I'd happily pay more for these things I bought !
__label__noemo	Yes . I'd like to place an overseas call to London . Can I dial direct ?
__label__noemo	Then you will be in line for a doom .
__label__joy	Sure . Here you go .
__label__noemo	It's a fifteen-minute intermission .
__label__noemo	Who ?
__label__noemo	Do you know how the national flag of Canada looks like ?
__label__noemo	Sure . 416-790-1256 .
__label__noemo	Be warned , sir . At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded .
__label__noemo	How are you doing today ?
__label__noemo	No , you needn't do that . You'd better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes .
__label__noemo	We ’ ll have them worked out by this evening and let you have them tomorrow morning . Would you be free to come by then ?
__label__joy	OK . Any time on Friday will be OK with me .
__label__noemo	Too much , Harry . Don't blame her anymore .
__label__noemo	I know , but that movie was just too good to leave . I guess I ’ ll just have to pay the price anti-sleepy .
__label__noemo	You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ?
__label__noemo	The office is in front of you as you cross the quad . The signs in the hallway will tell you where you need to be .
__label__noemo	I hear that he's quitting .
__label__joy	Certainly , sir . We hope you have a good trip .
__label__noemo	Why can't you just let me off with a warning ?
__label__noemo	Let me help you with your serve .
__label__noemo	How time flies ! He ’ s a big boy now .
__label__noemo	Is there anything wrong ?
__label__noemo	Could you tell me if there are any entrees that are vegetarian ?
__label__noemo	I like feature films best . How about you ?
__label__noemo	Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too.Do you have a color chart I can look at ?
__label__noemo	Well , I feel a little tired .
__label__joy	Any time after 6 o'clock is good for me.Oh ! I'm late ! I have a class .
__label__noemo	How do you get paid ? If you don't mind my asking .
__label__noemo	Please take a seat . Everything would be ready in a minute .
__label__noemo	I really would rather just listen.Isn ' t there anyone else who wants to sing ?
__label__joy	I love your outfit right now .
__label__noemo	What was your impression of her when you saw her in person ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s correct . It ’ s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case .
__label__joy	oh , sounds nice .
__label__noemo	Right over here , sir . What size do you wear ?
__label__noemo	Because the company is far away from home , and I have to study after work so I can't afford to waste time on the road everyday .
__label__sadness	I can ’ t believe it ! I guess I ’ ll be here until ten again tonight !
__label__joy	Boy ! What a beauty ! I fall in love with her at the first sight .
__label__noemo	I'm going to need it installed earlier than that .
__label__joy	Fine , I'll be expecting you .
__label__noemo	Guangzhou . I've got a cousin there .
__label__noemo	But I'm not used to looking up every new word when I'm reading a novel . I only look up the most necessary ones .
__label__joy	It was good . Do you have a girlfriend at school ?
__label__noemo	No , I enjoy travelling .
__label__noemo	Well , the products in themselves are very simple.It is the logo that is successful.So , Hello Kitty is successful because of the logo , but the products are very simple .
__label__noemo	Then have you received any award at your present company ?
__label__noemo	I think I'll soon get used to it .
__label__noemo	That ’ s all .
__label__noemo	Please ! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs .
__label__noemo	Yes , I did .
__label__noemo	I ’ m afraid not , Nick . That ’ s the best I can do .
__label__noemo	This small town has many serious problems .
__label__noemo	No , they have a big new fancy house .
__label__surprise	didn't they announce that our flight was delayed ?
__label__joy	Yes . And what dances do you do best ?
__label__noemo	What school do you go to ?
__label__noemo	Satin is like silk , Ma'am . It feels like silk . But it's a different material .
__label__surprise	This is a Porsche !
__label__noemo	What ? You mean strap myself to a flimsy kite ? No , thank you ! Next !
__label__noemo	But they're just ads .
__label__noemo	Here you are . How much is the ticket ?
__label__noemo	what do you think will happen to him ?
__label__noemo	I think I'll get some new goggles .
__label__anger	Waiter !
__label__noemo	Well , I also have ...
__label__noemo	We can provide you with standby letter of credit established by Bank of China .
__label__joy	Oh , it's nothing to speak of .
__label__noemo	Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful .
__label__noemo	I believe it's certainly for real . It without question has suffered a lot of delays . But there's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it's due to go off in December . It is a reality . It has just taken longer to get literally off the ground .
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__noemo	An automatic sedan .
__label__noemo	No , thanks . I'm going home . My wife's expecting me .
__label__joy	How about a little snack then ?
__label__joy	I love the sage green carpeting with the sunset-colored walls .
__label__noemo	Oh , come on , Gordon , it's the afternoon now . Why were you late really ?
__label__noemo	No wonder I haven ’ t seen you recently . Where did you spend your holidays ?
__label__joy	No . I'm just killing time .
__label__noemo	Oh , Cindy did mention you before . You're Alexander Newman .
__label__joy	Sounds great ! Can you stop somewhere here for a minute ? I will get some souvenirs for my friends .
__label__noemo	Just about . It should be done in the next couple of days . Why ?
__label__surprise	How could I ever forget ? I even bought you roses because I love you .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Oh , I'm very lucky that my wife let me take a heavy overcoat .
__label__noemo	Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo .
__label__noemo	There is none now because he likes to destroy toys .
__label__noemo	You've simply forgotten to wind it up , have you ? When do you usually wind it up ?
__label__joy	I like that joke , but I hope it's true .
__label__noemo	I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner .
__label__noemo	What department did you study in ?
__label__noemo	Your company is very reputed in this city . I heard much praise to your company .
__label__joy	Hello , Mr . Brown , long time no see . Where have you been ?
__label__anger	Well , you guys worked hard for it . It's really beautiful .
__label__noemo	Q-Duck ? Do you mean the famous roast-duck store ?
__label__noemo	American men are naturally taller than Chinese men . So even if I exercise , there aren ’ t many chances .
__label__noemo	No , I'll discuss the business with him at hotel .
__label__noemo	We can cover ourselves with beer ! That way if they bite us , they ’ ll get drunk and fall asleep .
__label__noemo	We're going to put in some new furniture .
__label__noemo	I hope it will be of some use .
__label__noemo	( after a while ... ) I'm his guide . What's the trouble with him , doctor
__label__noemo	Where do you live in China ?
__label__noemo	These are our cheapest coats , madam .
__label__noemo	I mean which ones are they better at than men ?
__label__noemo	Oh , my mistake . The reservation is for a suite and it is a non-smoking room with a king bed . I'm sorry for the error .
__label__noemo	Can't complain . And you ?
__label__noemo	Does your child still believe in Santa Claus ?
__label__joy	Sure , I've been meaning to visit that place myself .
__label__joy	It ’ s pretty good .
__label__noemo	Now , Mr.William , a little personal information first , are you married ?
__label__noemo	Well , if I were you , I'd go to see the doctor . That might help . And you'd better stay in bed today instead of going to work .
__label__noemo	What about cigarettes or cigars ?
__label__noemo	how did you figure out how to slove the Rubik's cube ?
__label__joy	Certainly .
__label__surprise	Are you kidding ? It ’ s summer .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll call you if I ’ m delayed .
__label__joy	I was just thinking to call you , then the phone rang and it was you calling me .
__label__anger	What ’ s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong .
__label__noemo	Well , that sounds better than giving it up .
__label__noemo	I feel sorry for her .
__label__noemo	Good morning , Jamie . What time is it now ?
__label__noemo	Good . I'll take care of it .
__label__joy	Wow , that sounds like a bargain . I'm running low on facial moisturizer and toner . Could you ring those up for me too along with the blush ?
__label__noemo	You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I hope so .
__label__noemo	Of course , Sir . If I could have your details again and your ID , I'll check them and we can go on .
__label__surprise	Couldn't get connection ?
__label__noemo	Yes , they do . I wish we Americans had a better train system .
__label__noemo	And would you like salad ? The salad plate today is lettuce , tomatoes , and black olives .
__label__noemo	No , she ’ s not as clever as me .
__label__noemo	Yes , and being friendly and having a good attitude also help me relax .
__label__noemo	Me too .
__label__noemo	What's in your bags ?
__label__noemo	Well , will you please put them down ?
__label__noemo	I would like to check out now.My room number is 712 .
__label__joy	Well , hang in there . In twenty years , you ’ ll fell it was well worth it !
__label__noemo	I heard they used ultraviolet lamp to kill pests .
__label__noemo	Yes , he is familiar with the plan .
__label__noemo	You know Iden , I don ’ t know much about you . Where were you born ?
__label__noemo	Well , the cultural differences impressed me most .
__label__noemo	Mostly on the civil war . You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr . had on American society .
__label__noemo	We're going to pay by check .
__label__noemo	Fine . But no one else , OK ?
__label__noemo	Yes , you definitely will .
__label__surprise	Really , she's so pretty .
__label__noemo	Ok , Ma'am . Calm down , 15 dollars will do .
__label__joy	Please accept this tip .
__label__noemo	Mr . Smith is really a thorough drag .
__label__noemo	Sports .
__label__noemo	Sometime next year .
__label__joy	Well , thank you very much , Mr . Sun . I'll let you know the result of the interview as soon as possible . Goodbye .
__label__noemo	Maybe Europe .
__label__noemo	How long has it been since we last saw each other ?
__label__surprise	Really ? I didn't know . Let me check . You're right .
__label__noemo	He is in his late thirties .
__label__noemo	Waiter , a table for two , please .
__label__noemo	Yes please . And I ’ d like to be able to make video calls too .
__label__noemo	Was it built before the In dynasty ? I thought it was in the Ming dynasty .
__label__noemo	So how far is the museum , dad ?
__label__noemo	Only a week .
__label__noemo	So , what kind of dishes do you usually make ? I know you like Italian food .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid I can't agree with you .
__label__noemo	Where do you need it to be delivered to ?
__label__noemo	My doctor said that I need a chest X-ray .
__label__noemo	I have faith in our new President .
__label__noemo	Seventy US dollars .
__label__disgust	I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . After all , it's a sport . But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ?
__label__noemo	No , I'm going to leave the office early today . My annual medical check-up is this afternoon .
__label__noemo	We do not want to place ourselves in an inferior position . We are a good , small company---that's why you are interested .
__label__noemo	I think we have a while longer .
__label__noemo	Why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? You ’ ll have the same time for work .
__label__noemo	Would you ? I wouldn't .
__label__noemo	Do you like ice skating ?
__label__noemo	I know , I know . I am really trying , but I don ’ t have the willpower to just quit . I can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ?
__label__noemo	You didn't note the damage on the bill of lading .
__label__joy	Well , what do you like doing ?
__label__noemo	Oh ...
__label__noemo	Yes , they are very fashionable , you see .
__label__noemo	Taylor , you're sweating up a storm !
__label__noemo	That is true . Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . For example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off .
__label__noemo	I have been married for three years .
__label__noemo	I have it right here .
__label__noemo	I'm doing well , and you ?
__label__noemo	Morning , Michael . I ’ Ve been very busy lately . One of our other vendors is going out of business and I ’ Ve been searching for a suitable replacement .
__label__noemo	No , it's too crowded .
__label__noemo	Right now he speaks mostly Chinese , and he can say a few English words . But he will learn .
__label__noemo	I don't want any other woman .
__label__sadness	I am sorry , sir . But may I see your driver's license and insurance policy , PLS ? I have to give you a ticket .
__label__noemo	Those are great . How much were they ?
__label__noemo	Thanks .
__label__noemo	She's speaking French , not Greek .
__label__noemo	Ok , I guess . My boss has been on my back recently .
__label__noemo	You turned 18 a month before the election .
__label__noemo	It's an interesting job , and your company is one of the best known . Although I have no work experience as a salesperson , the job description you sent was very interesting . It's a job I've been dreaming of when I was at university .
__label__noemo	Yes , sir . Your shirts will be ready by Thursday morning . Anything else ?
__label__noemo	I guess we'd better get back to work .
__label__noemo	A little French .
__label__noemo	I want to say goodbye to everyone .
__label__joy	Perfect ! Couldn't be better .
__label__disgust	That would be very good of you , Mr . White .
__label__joy	The singing group used to be very popular .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Did you know that they pay as much attention to what you ask as to what you say in an interview ?
__label__noemo	What are they doing in Beijing ?
__label__noemo	You got a raise ?
__label__noemo	I learned to be patient , professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .
__label__noemo	About 80 million dollars .
__label__noemo	Can I do that right now ?
__label__joy	You're welcome . May you have a good time . Please give my regards to your wife . I wish her a happy birthday tomorrow .
__label__noemo	I sure hope so .
__label__noemo	What did you watch ?
__label__noemo	I like spring . The days are long and the nights are short . The flowers in blew . We go on picnics
__label__noemo	Do you want to go to and empty classroom ?
__label__noemo	Well , bring him along too . We ’ ll have a great time this weekend .
__label__joy	You speak English very well .
__label__noemo	I realize that , and I can do all that when I wake up in five minutes .
__label__noemo	Once , when I was a child .
__label__noemo	I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime .
__label__noemo	Is your brother older or younger than you ?
__label__noemo	Ah I see , yes you do sound rather croaky . Well let ’ s have a look , shall we ? Could you please open your mouth and say ” ah ” .
__label__noemo	I'll take a dozen .
__label__noemo	Not quite good . It's windy and dry . We have got continental climate there . It's dry all the year round . Usually autumn is the best season of the year In New York .
__label__noemo	You've got a deal .
__label__joy	Yes , I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist .
__label__noemo	Not at all .
__label__joy	It is the best season to view red leaves from the Mid-October to the first ten days of November . During the period , thousands of hectares of maples on the sloping field are so red that you would recognize them as fallen petals by mistake if looking from a further area . The bright red , pink , scarlet , and peach-puff leaves are distributed in different layout , with some green pines and cypresses dotted in between .
__label__noemo	Yeah . I guess it does . Sorry again for bothering you .
__label__noemo	My wife and I are thinking about taking our parents with us on a vacation . Do you have any suggestion about where to go ?
__label__noemo	What are you best at ?
__label__joy	Great . I'll stop by your place now .
__label__noemo	I suppose you know very well that we require irrevocable letters of credit payable against presentation of shipping documents .
__label__joy	Well you should come with me one day , I'm sure you'll love it .
__label__sadness	NYU was my first choice .
__label__joy	The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ’ s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ’ s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa
__label__noemo	Excuse me , does this bus go to the new bookstore ?
__label__noemo	But the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order .
__label__noemo	Room 1419 . Here's my key .
__label__noemo	Not as long as it gets fixed .
__label__noemo	That's great ! I'd like to take the first available flight . I'll need an economy ticket
__label__noemo	Ok , George . Bye !
__label__noemo	Mary said Jack was cheating on her . Jack was seeing a girl from his hometown . One day , Mary saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately .
__label__noemo	Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at your company ?
__label__noemo	Do you know where Dawanglu is ?
__label__noemo	You mean we can't stay in this hotel tonight ?
__label__noemo	I see .
__label__noemo	So what ? I got a ninety-nine .
__label__noemo	They're serviced regularly . We give them a basic service every 10,000 km or so and a main service once a year , or every 100,000 km .
__label__noemo	All right , come back and bring your ID .
__label__noemo	Oh , I'm sorry . Mr . Nelson is away at the moment . I'm sorry that you keep missing him while he is out of the office . Would you like to leave a message ?
__label__noemo	Why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ?
__label__noemo	that's fine . I'd like to be on the aisle anyway . It's easier to get in and out .
__label__sadness	That ’ s the dumbest thing that I ’ Ve ever heard .
__label__noemo	Sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate .
__label__noemo	Hi , Martin . I ’ Ve been looking for you all morning .
__label__noemo	Come in , please .
__label__noemo	What kind of scholarship is it ?
__label__noemo	Yes , so far as we know , in the field , your company has lots of experience and we hope you will consider the tender seriously .
__label__joy	Thanks for everything .
__label__sadness	My dissertation . I put it somewhere last night and I can't find it now .
__label__noemo	Ah , there's something in what you're saying . According to the present FDA regulations , the Ma Ling Labels then cannot be used if the lichee is to be offered for import into the United States .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Oh , you look stunning . Your dress really goes well with your shoes .
__label__noemo	Let me check ... yes , we got the October issue a few days ago . It's on that shelf over there .
__label__noemo	I am flattered . But I am not sure whether the manager is satisfied with it . She asked me to her office .
__label__noemo	They think you are just a child .
__label__noemo	I'll be waiting .
__label__noemo	Does it include a facial mask and a massage ?
__label__noemo	If I told her that , she would faint and have me committed !
__label__noemo	Got it .
__label__noemo	Hold on a minute , please .
__label__noemo	Is there a receipt ?
__label__joy	I think you ’ Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ?
__label__joy	He usually keeps me posted .
__label__noemo	Down the hall . I'll show you when the interview is over .
__label__noemo	You can wear that pretty red dress .
__label__noemo	I'm going to my parents ' house for my father's birthday .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t worry . Sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the cleaning or take care of the children .
__label__surprise	Really ? A foreign parrot !
__label__noemo	A dozen will be fine .
__label__joy	Hi , Ross . Glad to see you , too .
__label__noemo	Is PCC a good school ?
__label__noemo	It's worth it just to go and eat what the mafia eat ! The five-dollar tiramisu is a culinary orgasm .
__label__noemo	Indeed . He's strict with himself , too . We can see every lecture of his is well-prepared .
__label__noemo	Ok , I guess . My boss has been on my back recently .
__label__surprise	What ! I resent that !
__label__joy	Sounds good . Where and when will we meet ?
__label__noemo	They are all pretty easy-going . It's a very friendly place to work .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I know what you mean .
__label__noemo	Could you tell me where the copy room is ?
__label__joy	we ’ re glad that you ’ re here . Would you like a tour of the house ?
__label__noemo	Oh , don't you ? God save me !
__label__noemo	Not quite the only one . I really wanted that job at the magazine , but I still haven't heard from them .
__label__noemo	Yes , you're saving money because they're on sale today .
__label__noemo	No , there ’ s no need .
__label__noemo	What did you want to drink ?
__label__noemo	One moment , please . Ah yes , Mr . Hilton , you booked a single room for three nights . Is that correct ?
__label__noemo	no , I'm not feeling myself . I just want to check my emails , visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends .
__label__noemo	Do you have much time watching TV ?
__label__noemo	Hey , Peter , have you had lunch yet ?
__label__joy	Did you get a nice tree ?
__label__noemo	I am not sure . You can check with the finance department .
__label__noemo	Yes , give me two rolls of Kodak color film .
__label__noemo	I don't understand some things .
__label__noemo	My brother joined the army last year .
__label__noemo	I ’ d better be going .
__label__noemo	OK , This one is one hundred and twenty . It's the cheapest here .
__label__noemo	So I need plenty of space for this exercise .
__label__noemo	We don't have a full-sized swimming pool , but we do have individual swim stations .
__label__noemo	That ’ s what I ’ Ve heard . But as far as I ’ m concerned , it takes a genius to figure it out . Can you pass the sugar , please ?
__label__noemo	Sure , I'd love to ! But let me pay for the tickets this time . It's my turn .
__label__noemo	Hi , Rose . How ’ s everything ?
__label__noemo	It wasn't cold out this morning .
__label__noemo	Yes , but I want to go to the country .
__label__noemo	You mean we'll share the taxi ?
__label__noemo	And the downstairs neighbors ?
__label__noemo	Good . I'll take that one . Is there a bar in your hotel ?
__label__noemo	But I want to burn up more calories !
__label__noemo	I don't know about that , but I do think that it helps people relax .
__label__noemo	Are you sure ?
__label__noemo	You can get it from the student business office .
__label__noemo	Come on . You ’ ll feel better after we hit the showers .
__label__noemo	Why do you want to leave your present job ?
__label__noemo	My boss promised to pay me double time .
__label__noemo	What's wrong with it ?
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__noemo	But they are so silly ! They're not art !
__label__noemo	I'll take one right now for seven dollars .
__label__noemo	I see . Does he live by himself ?
__label__noemo	Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ?
__label__noemo	Would you agree that the service is fast ?
__label__joy	Thanks . Now let's decide which one of these suits looks best for this occasion .
__label__noemo	Usually the response to the second offer moves along a bit more quickly than the first one .
__label__surprise	You are sick , young lady . Get back in bed ! I called you in sick today , so you're going to lie down and fight that flu !
__label__noemo	Can you tell Bob from Tom ?
__label__noemo	Can she speak Chinese ?
__label__noemo	How about Karlis ?
__label__noemo	I will .
__label__noemo	They are above 90 . I ’ m in the upper third of my class . I have worked hard at my major subject .
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__noemo	I have a reservation for a single with a bath .
__label__noemo	With everything , with everybody , with all this !
__label__noemo	Can you tell me where it hurts ?
__label__noemo	I'm surprised you know so much about it . Where's your phone ?
__label__noemo	That may be true , but I don't want an inter-office relationship to affect my productivity .
__label__noemo	That is D-A-V-I-D , W-H-I-T-E .
__label__noemo	They're a little bit too long , so I'd like about half an inch taken off them .
__label__noemo	Do you mind if we switch over ?
__label__joy	Of course not . Your daughter is smart and very well behaved .
__label__noemo	Do you have any other questions ?
__label__noemo	Here's Copellini's , my cousin's store .
__label__joy	Of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ...
__label__noemo	Usually , if the problem is insignificant I advise the customer to go ahead ; it's normally a translation problem or something like that . But this does seem a little more serious . I suggest you get back on to them right now and ask them about it . Hopefully you can sort it out over the phone .
__label__joy	Let's go to the coffee shop then . It's quiet there .
__label__joy	No . Why don't you check out the newspaper ?
__label__noemo	Their family is very similar to Cindy and Ron ’ s family .
__label__noemo	That bus goes all the way to LA ?
__label__noemo	It is largest pop square in the world.you see that is monument for the people's hero , and the Chairman Mao memorial hall on the south.there is great hall of the people on the west.there are two museums on the east .
__label__noemo	Millions of things . I surf the Net , check my e-mail , and most importantly , I chat with my friends .
__label__noemo	I have been feeling sick for three days .
__label__noemo	No , I don't know what the curb colors mean .
__label__noemo	Right , do you need them to respond ?
__label__noemo	Yes . Playing chess is a very aggressive experience . All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . Whenever I start a chess game , I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill .
__label__noemo	I would like to buy a new fridge .
__label__noemo	These days , I can't think of anything but motor oil . Even coffee makes me think of it .
__label__noemo	Right here . I'll do it for you . ( Three minutes later ) Your car's ready .
__label__noemo	Hey ! What's up ?
__label__noemo	Nothing is to your satisfaction .
__label__noemo	Tom , this is Mary Bobbins . She ’ s just come over from sales .
__label__noemo	A T-I-M-E , Time Deposit . You can chose from 5 different grades
__label__noemo	OK , let me check availability . I'm sorry . Tickets for that flight are sold out .
__label__noemo	We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with .
__label__noemo	Maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much !
__label__noemo	Well , I've already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
__label__noemo	OK , I will .
__label__noemo	Are you still hungry , Ryan ? How about some more squid balls ?
__label__noemo	Do you know how much this job offers per year ?
__label__noemo	Of course I will .
__label__noemo	Later we'll let you know who the King and Queen of the Reunion will be .
__label__noemo	And that is what's causing my shortness of breath .
__label__noemo	Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription .
__label__joy	Well , I do have assets in my country . like I said , I own a house , and see , here ’ s a bank statement showing my investments , and my bank balance .
__label__noemo	I do yoga twice a weeks
__label__noemo	I thought you meant vegetables and meat when you asked me . Things like that . I don't have any vegetables .
__label__noemo	We can take a bus there .
__label__noemo	The second call is now changed to 7 thirty . Is there anything else we can help you with ?
__label__noemo	Yes , sir . Would you like to remit it by M / T or by T / T ?
__label__surprise	Huh ? Didn ’ t you know ? Aren ’ t you excited ?
__label__joy	Yes . you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad.sometimes new food might disagree with you .
__label__noemo	anything you need to have in the place ?
__label__noemo	October 16th .
__label__noemo	I worked as a PR clerk for one year
__label__noemo	OK , I see . Here you are . Is that OK now ?
__label__noemo	Well , we will wash the exterior form top to bottom . We use a special shampoo , which gives the body that extra shine .
__label__noemo	We wish to express our desire to trade with you in leather shoes .
__label__noemo	Everybody who walks past me sees it . Besides , it's a good sunbathing suit .
__label__noemo	I can call a plumber to fix it right now .
__label__noemo	Do I have to work on weekend ? If so , how do you pay for the overtime ?
__label__joy	Thank you . I am very happy to have my own office now . I ’ Ve never had one before . It is very nice .
__label__joy	Yes , thank you .
__label__joy	About four years now .
__label__noemo	How much would you like it to be , then ?
__label__noemo	Jack Remington , room 1408 .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll tell you if you let me go .
__label__noemo	I never cheat .
__label__noemo	The headlines are all about the presidential election in the united states . Few other stories made the front pages .
__label__noemo	It has been pleasant talking with you .
__label__noemo	There ’ re traffic jams everywhere .
__label__noemo	No , there were too many people . When she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and to get her autographs .
__label__surprise	I ’ m sorry ? !
__label__noemo	All right . Ask me a question now .
__label__noemo	You keep bowling spares but no strike .
__label__noemo	Well , if you just take a look here , see , with our chequing account , you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee , and our savings account has a higher interest rate , but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10,000 dollars .
__label__noemo	Oh , come on . You know it's a long process , you have to be patient .
__label__noemo	I'm exhausted . My new exercise is so hard .
__label__joy	I ’ m really looking forward to it . This party is going to be a blast !
__label__surprise	Really ? You only review your lessons in one month ? Does it work ?
__label__noemo	It says No smoking here .
__label__noemo	Believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . Employees are actually more productive on casual days .
__label__noemo	I think it's a waste of money .
__label__noemo	Don't get up so late next time . You should have gone to bed earlier last night .
__label__noemo	Well , that's fine . So I don't think it necessary for us to make a reservation . We will be there at 9:30 .
__label__noemo	We will fine you if you damage it .
__label__joy	Don't worry . I can give you a lift .
__label__noemo	What would you like to drink ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I pretty much understand the company .
__label__noemo	sure , but how ?
__label__noemo	I am .
__label__noemo	Steven , why are you so depressed ?
__label__noemo	Oh , to tell you the truth , I love the sky . When I was a child , I imagined flying into the blue sky some day . Now , I think the day has come . My dream will come true . And I like travelling very much and I enjoy working with people .
__label__noemo	Have you got any wine or spirits ?
__label__noemo	Where are you going ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s a big room with a king - size double bed and two single beds . You ’ Ve get also an roller-wheels .
__label__noemo	Now that I think about it , it really is sometimes .
__label__joy	That ’ s a great idea . We can really enjoy ourselves without worrying about the kids .
__label__noemo	Here ! Here ! Use my card !
__label__noemo	Yes , Please tell him I called and ask him to return my call as soon as possible . It's about the PPT contract .
__label__noemo	What does Human Resources Department do ?
__label__noemo	Your silk garments have aroused much interest in our country ever since our first order was put on the market . We have no doubt we can do better this year if you appoint us your sales agent .
__label__noemo	Oh , I didn't think of that .
__label__noemo	Well , that ’ s a problem , isn ’ t it ?
__label__noemo	Not bad . There ’ s a new English teacher .
__label__noemo	Do you have any price range ? Is there any way you can give me any idea of what direction to go or how high is too high ?
__label__noemo	I'll explain later , let's go .
__label__noemo	Yes , to tell you the truth . I am on the diet .
__label__joy	Great . At first , you can put the chairs back .
__label__noemo	Sure . What do you need the most help with , the food or entertainment ?
__label__noemo	OK , I'll take one .
__label__noemo	OK , I'll begin the opening procedure now and we'll let you know when everything is sorted .
__label__noemo	Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients .
__label__joy	Thanks , Denise . Actually , I was really surprised . I mean , there were a lot of qualified people out there .
__label__noemo	I've never had a mango .
__label__noemo	Yeah , that's pretty hard for me .
__label__noemo	Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now .
__label__noemo	Well , you've come to the right place . What kind of watch are you looking for ?
__label__joy	Thank you , doctor . Goodbye .
__label__noemo	I know . I know !
__label__noemo	I'm thinking of taking his class next semester .
__label__noemo	Please , honey , I have made proposals to you fifteen times .
__label__noemo	No , I live alone in a flat near my work place .
__label__noemo	I am calling to apply to work in your agency of entry .
__label__noemo	I hope I don ’ t ever see you back in here .
__label__joy	Let's stop the car and enjoy it for a minute .
__label__noemo	I don't know exactly . I only hear it's financed by a famous film star .
__label__joy	See . Great minds think alike .
__label__joy	I ’ m fine , thank you .
__label__noemo	I slept like a baby . I fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have any nightmares !
__label__noemo	The news said they should be fine .
__label__joy	Here you are . Thank you and have a nice evening .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid it's too hard to wash off the stain .
__label__noemo	It ’ s much larger than I expected . When was the plant set up ?
__label__noemo	I guess so .
__label__noemo	Seats No . 20 and 21 . It ’ s nice that we ’ Ve got a window seat .
__label__noemo	I think you should look over these figures again . There are some calculations that are a bit off .
__label__noemo	Well , it's a bit overweight . You must pay extra for it .
__label__noemo	It's C261 .
__label__noemo	Then , what's special tonight ?
__label__noemo	When does the library close ?
__label__joy	Yes . Thank you .
__label__noemo	Anything else ?
__label__noemo	Thomas , would you be so kind as to lay the table for me ? I'm busy in the kitchen .
__label__noemo	Hello
__label__noemo	We never fail to meet our client's expectation .
__label__disgust	It ’ s the worst thing I ’ Ve ever tried .
__label__surprise	Is that true ?
__label__noemo	Nothing but the best for a pretty woman !
__label__noemo	I see.You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ?
__label__noemo	Here , sir , sit down in this wheelchair .
__label__noemo	It's too bad that I couldn't make it . Who won ?
__label__noemo	Wait ! We have T-bone , rib eye , and sirloin steaks . They are very fresh ! Just came from the slaughter house ...
__label__noemo	Yeah . It ’ s a lot better than mine .
__label__noemo	You'll have to catch two different buses to get there .
__label__noemo	Which season do you like best ?
__label__noemo	Tomorrow we'll go and pick out some curtains and paint .
__label__noemo	No , it doesn't . There's no through bus to the National History Museum , madam .
__label__noemo	So it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about education.They would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing . I don't think that's a bad thing . I think it's a good thing.In America , too many parents don't pay attention .
__label__surprise	Really ? That's the icing on the cake . Congratulation again !
__label__noemo	So , Lauren , I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative , Jason Huntley .
__label__noemo	Ok , got it . I will call you sometime next week .
__label__joy	You know what , this is the best part . David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank , so he ’ s got a great career path ahead of him !
__label__noemo	That's exactly what I want . How much does it charge ?
__label__joy	Cool ! But isn't that a hot air popcorn popper ?
__label__joy	Not bad . It really is great to see you again . W here have you been ?
__label__noemo	The winter is very rainy , I don't like the rainy day .
__label__noemo	I don't like them . I used to take them when I had to work overtime , you know .
__label__noemo	That'll be a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and porterhouse , all charged to your amenities account .
__label__joy	She ’ s got quite a crowd around her . Oh , look ! That little girl caught it !
__label__noemo	I see . Why not use wooden cases ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ?
__label__joy	Yes , the weather sure is nice today .
__label__noemo	I am having some trouble . How do you use this printer ?
__label__noemo	I see . OK .
__label__noemo	Would you mind telling me a little bit about your present job ?
__label__noemo	He spoke evil behind his back .
__label__noemo	I'd like to reserve two seats for tomorrow night .
__label__noemo	Could you tell me your name , sir , please ?
__label__noemo	What's your name , please ?
__label__noemo	It will begin at five thirty .
__label__joy	That would be great ! Give me a call !
__label__noemo	Quite a difference , huh ?
__label__noemo	Most people think that wealth means success . But from my point of view , the problem should be viewed from two aspects . On the one hand , wealth is a very important thing to measure success . The ability to make money , to some extent , signifies your knowledge , your capability , the value of your labor , etc .. With the development of our economy and industry , more and more people are pursuing money these days . And in toda / s society , If you have money , you seem to have everything . But this is not the case . I think success , on the other hand , also means satisfaction from work . It also means that you can get respect from others .
__label__anger	What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ...
__label__noemo	I just had a quarrel with him .
__label__noemo	I've got 6 packets of cigarettes and 2 bottles of champagne . Besides , I have two cameras , one is for my own use , and the other is a gift .
__label__noemo	It's a great pleasure to meet you , Mr . White . I believe you have seen our exhibits in the showroom . What is it that particularly interests you ?
__label__noemo	Not yet . I feel too lousy to go out.Anyway , I have a flu . I know what it is . I don't need a doctor to tell me that .
__label__noemo	So what can we do ?
__label__noemo	Thank you . Same to you .
__label__joy	That's great news .
__label__noemo	Well , any bank will cash it at our present traveler's check buying rate , for which we ’ re somewhere cheaper than hotels because of the service charge . You see , hotels really aren ’ t in the money exchange business although they will cash traveler ’ s check for their guest .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Marvelous . Pass it over . My name's George , by the way .
__label__noemo	Oh , I am very sorry about that . It's our fault . I will arrange someone to correct it immediately .
__label__joy	The place is OK.Let ' s go there and have a look at it again .
__label__noemo	That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars to be covered . Let's meet each other half way once more , then the gap will be closed and our business completed .
__label__noemo	4 days .
__label__joy	Yes , I did . I had a fine time .
__label__noemo	Are they window seats or aisle seats ?
__label__noemo	Right here . See the scratch ?
__label__joy	Thank you . He ’ s very lucky indeed .
__label__noemo	What are spring and autumn like ?
__label__noemo	What is your specialty ?
__label__noemo	I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall .
__label__noemo	We have hundreds of constituencies and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . Most people call them mp ’ s .
__label__joy	How about a movie ? We haven't done that for a while .
__label__noemo	I am sorry.sir . Someone will there in a moment .
__label__noemo	So how long did you stay ?
__label__noemo	Sorry , I ’ m not a volleyball-fun . I ’ d rather play football . How about you , Mr . Wang . ? Are you interested in volleyball ?
__label__noemo	No , I just want to meet you .
__label__noemo	I have read your resume.What is your last job ?
__label__noemo	Don't you know ? Tomorrow is Father's Day .
__label__noemo	Totally . Computers bring with them convenience.Oh , what's wrong ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m paid 2,000 yuan per month plus some allowances and bonus as that come to about 3,000 yuan a month . How much will you pay me ?
__label__noemo	5 days . From Feb . 13 to 18 .
__label__noemo	Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me .
__label__noemo	How much do you think the rent will be ?
__label__noemo	What're you going to buy ?
__label__noemo	What do you have to do ?
__label__noemo	F . Y . I . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you're done ...
__label__noemo	Did you enjoy that new movie ?
__label__noemo	Write down your name and address , give me the key , and I will check it out .
__label__noemo	I'm having some trouble . How do you use this printer ?
__label__joy	How have you been ?
__label__noemo	350 yuan .
__label__noemo	do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ?
__label__noemo	We start on Monday . Can you be there ?
__label__surprise	I didn ’ t know it would be so big !
__label__noemo	No , once I did 32 .
__label__noemo	I know . But I don't have someone to diet with . If we help each other and motivate each other , then I think we can lose some weight .
__label__noemo	Yes . Where would you like to go ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I do . It ’ s hard to find four players though , so I don ’ t play very often . Do you know anyone who plays ? If so , we could set up a game .
__label__noemo	I thought we'll just fix up the wood floor.and use some paint for the walls .
__label__noemo	Admittedly , I don't . But I still beg you to give me an opportunity , and I'm willing to learn with my best effort .
__label__noemo	That should make things perfectly simple , then . Actually , if you had waited a little while longer , we would have notified you by post .
__label__noemo	No , I assure you .
__label__noemo	Yes , we can handle that here . How can I help you ?
__label__joy	$ 110.00 , your change is $ 5.01 . Thanks very much .
__label__noemo	I'm not too scared . But I've done sky diving before .
__label__noemo	The fare is $ 1.25 .
__label__noemo	Hi there ! My name's Terry Graham . You're new around here , huh ?
__label__noemo	Yes , tell him Mr . Cook called and ask him to return my called as soon as he back .
__label__noemo	Yes and no . I can ' t wait to go to Europe , but at the same time I am terrified .
__label__noemo	I have things to do .
__label__noemo	That's too bad .
__label__surprise	What ? Leftovers of what and from when ?
__label__noemo	The skin packing is the most advanced packing for this product in the world market . It catches the eyes and can help push sales .
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__noemo	You really have talent . How did you learn to do this ?
__label__noemo	That's true .
__label__noemo	Do you have a problem walking a little bit ?
__label__noemo	Yes , and I have already gone through the safety inspection .
__label__noemo	Did you hear Peter just retired ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry Ms Reeve , it says 45,000 RIB here .
__label__noemo	Well , they come in white , pale yellow , aqua , red and green . Will a white one do ?
__label__noemo	Oh , yes ! I didn't think about that.Thank you for reminding me . How many days should we spend on a vacation ?
__label__noemo	Do you know any places ?
__label__noemo	Where do you live ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m free all afternoon . Why don ’ t we meet at 1 o ’ clock in the lobby ?
__label__noemo	I am not certain about that .
__label__noemo	Come on , it ’ s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging .
__label__noemo	Hey , guys ! Did you see that sign ?
__label__noemo	What are the side effects of that drug ?
__label__noemo	The day before yesterday . I only visited Montreal and Ottawa , but I had a great time .
__label__noemo	Yeah , a number of times .
__label__surprise	What ? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's , he said he was coming .
__label__noemo	Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , he first said it was someone from work . He gave me a lame excuse , and so I pressed him on it .
__label__noemo	Did you get any pizza ? When I got there , only small one was left . What a pity !
__label__noemo	What made you decide to change your job ?
__label__noemo	He does . He ’ s good at this genre too . It ’ s a captivating read .
__label__surprise	Hey ! Why don't I have any presents !
__label__noemo	But you're OK ? It was nothing serious , was it ?
__label__joy	I'll turn the heat up .
__label__noemo	Oh , it's out of paper . Do you have any more ?
__label__noemo	May I see the inside for myself ?
__label__noemo	Why not a ring ?
__label__noemo	Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .
__label__noemo	When can I know whether I'm accepted or not ?
__label__noemo	Girl , don't make fun of your Daddy . But I can introduce him to my personal trainer . Maybe one day he will be a fitness freak instead of a cough potato .
__label__noemo	What's her last name ?
__label__noemo	John Smith .
__label__noemo	Sure , on the fourth floor is a recreation quarter . There are two swimming pools . One is Olympic standard size and the other one is for children . Also , there is a gymnasium for resident members only .
__label__noemo	Well , then the cafeteria suits you best . But anyway , if you like to have a lunch outside the company , feel free to join me anytime .
__label__noemo	Would you do me a favor ?
__label__joy	That's OK . We can go jogging , after we eat !
__label__noemo	I don ’ t want you to be worried , but our son has some bad habits now . He says painful words everyday .
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__joy	Smart .
__label__noemo	I'll return at about 4:30 pm . See you then .
__label__joy	OK , I see . Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	Everything is right here . If that's all in order , just let me know where I sign .
__label__noemo	Beam and Perrier . Anything else , sir ?
__label__noemo	alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill .
__label__sadness	I'm afraid you've made a mistake . This isn't what I ordered .
__label__noemo	You really shouldn ’ t write it down . You should memorise it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like .
__label__noemo	That's very good . But I have little knowledge about the packing of your pliers . I just want to know the details about that .
__label__noemo	Will my record be cleared after I pay the fine ?
__label__joy	I hope everything will be smooth .
__label__noemo	Then , how about this room with just a shower ?
__label__noemo	Mr . Emory ? I think it ’ s time to get a new computer .
__label__noemo	What do they say ?
__label__joy	Thanks a lot . I'm most grateful .
__label__noemo	We seem to be lost here .
__label__noemo	I should be done by Friday . I ’ ll give it to you in class then .
__label__joy	that ’ s gorgeous ! Do they have it in a size 8 ?
__label__noemo	never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , it ’ s been ages ! So how have you been ?
__label__noemo	Can you show me how to use this phone ?
__label__noemo	Okay , the bathroom plumbing needs looking at . What about the kitchen plumbing ?
__label__noemo	What did he say ?
__label__noemo	What have you learned from jobs you have held ?
__label__noemo	Do you like miniskirt ? It's popular among young girls . The pleated skirt also sells well .
__label__noemo	let's watch the Canadian team . They have a good manager and a great coach .
__label__noemo	That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ?
__label__noemo	you ’ re right . We will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built-up areas .
__label__noemo	Thank you , I'll try again later .
__label__noemo	Could you tell me how to use it ?
__label__noemo	Thanks . I am all right . It's just my nose . It must be an allergy . Do you have any aspirin ? I have a terrible headache .
__label__anger	They didn ’ t let me go until the next morning .
__label__noemo	What for ?
__label__joy	Wow ! This was a lot easier than I thought !
__label__noemo	It is not only the earthquake , sir . But the mudslides.Much of the north half of the site has been covered over by mud .
__label__noemo	Right . Got that .
__label__noemo	Why not go to Paris ? It's famous for Arch of Triumph , Eiffel , versailles and place de la Concorde .
__label__noemo	Naturally . Each of us keeps one original and two copies .
__label__noemo	So far , less than 20 people have died , but over 100 are in hospital .
__label__noemo	10 in the morning ?
__label__noemo	I suppose I do .
__label__noemo	Oh , is it ? Let me check .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t like a lot of clutter , so I wouldn ’ t have lots of things out . I would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls , but other than that , most things would be kept in closets .
__label__anger	Are you sure you're finished ?
__label__noemo	What kind of food do they serve ?
__label__noemo	And then I ’ m moving to Florida where I can play golf all day , every day !
__label__noemo	Good afternoon . I believe that this house is for sale .
__label__noemo	How do you do . I ’ m Mark Rancor .
__label__noemo	I have two people to a room . The $ 80 room rate is the lowest I could find . With the conference going on that week , all the hotels have inflated their prices , they're making a killing .
__label__joy	Absolutely . She's a teacher of aerobics .
__label__noemo	Come on , you are making too big deal out of this .
__label__noemo	Why's the plane shaking ?
__label__noemo	I really appreciate the way you Chinese people exchange feelings . The holiday's long enough for you to relax .
__label__joy	Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ...
__label__noemo	Come on . Cheer up !
__label__noemo	I know . But we could get some exercise in , and we could get some errands run , too . Window-shopping won ’ t cost you anything .
__label__joy	this is perfect ! What do you think ?
__label__noemo	Where is it made ?
__label__joy	Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink .
__label__noemo	All right .
__label__joy	Great . When in Rome , you guys know what to do .
__label__noemo	Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . Price yourself near the low end . Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . Th
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__noemo	let ’ s go and get a coffee together . That will help you to wake up again !
__label__noemo	I think it is unemployment that gives rise to such social problems .
__label__joy	It was that final sprint ! You were great ! Really !
__label__noemo	Then , you are to walk to work .
__label__noemo	What's your dreamhole like then ?
__label__noemo	Do you already know how to play an instrument ?
__label__noemo	There is a stop at Tiananmen Square . The stops will be announced on the bus both in English and Chinese . When the stop is coming , you just push the red button near the rear door if you want to get off .
__label__noemo	I did . I especially liked the food . What do you think about the food here ?
__label__noemo	What's the matter ?
__label__anger	I don't care .
__label__noemo	Come on , what have you got to lose ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s exactly twelve minutes past seven .
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__noemo	There are computers at our EDD offices for you to use in your job search .
__label__noemo	What doesn ’ t feel right ?
__label__noemo	That's a hard time . The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy .
__label__noemo	Well , when summer comes , the weather is hot and the leaves turn darkgreen ; the sun is blazing and the air is threatening . No one would like to stay in the open air for long .
__label__joy	Yes , we can have a picnic on the top of the hill .
__label__joy	It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite .
__label__noemo	I have one ten-day tour that is still available . It will depart from New York on December 24th .
__label__joy	Is your helmet comfortable ?
__label__noemo	Tariff provides the government with extra tax revenue .
__label__noemo	Right at the Hilton .
__label__noemo	Anything else I should know ?
__label__noemo	How long are you going to stay ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s the last four charges .
__label__joy	I wish you good luck !
__label__noemo	They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . I was wondering how to order office supplies .
__label__noemo	It's some medicine the doctor recommends . If you leave it at home , you will find it difficult to face up when the old people suffered a seizure .
__label__noemo	That's right . Not all states have an income tax . Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead .
__label__noemo	I don't just survive . I put money away as well . I know when I get paid where most of the cash will go , and I stick to my plan . If I follow a budget I don't have any nasty surprises .
__label__noemo	well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kind made me uneasy .
__label__noemo	Fill it up with regular , please .
__label__noemo	The re-examination results indicate that one-third of the goods are not up to standard .
__label__noemo	They're in awe of her . After they saw how she crushed WebTracker ... but I guess you know all about that .
__label__noemo	Of course . What about you ?
__label__noemo	Maybe he's gifted in that .
__label__joy	The time has come to say goodbye .
__label__noemo	Are you ready for your big interview tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	No , I can only carry on a simple conversation in French .
__label__joy	Hey , you look great ! how's everything ?
__label__noemo	I see . Wait for a moment please . I am sorry , Mrs . Clinton , but the remittance doesn't appear to have arrived yet .
__label__noemo	Now you're talking .
__label__noemo	How much should I pay ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it is.But it's nice in spring and fall .
__label__noemo	How are you feeling , champ ? Ready to go ?
__label__noemo	It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries .
__label__noemo	I've only done it once .
__label__joy	Wonderful .
__label__noemo	Can you fix me a cup of tea , Johnny ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I know what the curb colors mean .
__label__noemo	it wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .
__label__joy	Good idea . So we Can rest in the shadow of the tree .
__label__noemo	You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything .
__label__noemo	Make sure that you transfer the utilities to your name and tell them when you will be moving in .
__label__noemo	Can you exchange this for US dollars , please ?
__label__noemo	well , the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him .
__label__noemo	Good morning , sir . Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to be waken up tomorrow morning .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__noemo	absolutely not ! He's a cheater . I will never talk to him again . I'm over with him . He's history !
__label__noemo	My name is Liu Lichi . How do you do ?
__label__noemo	Where would you like to go to school ?
__label__noemo	No , not yet , but I do feel a little feverish .
__label__noemo	Here are a variety of red wines for you to choose . You can have a taste then make your decision then . Here is the wine menu .
__label__noemo	Are you ok , Chuck ? You look pale .
__label__noemo	Well , we could just go out as friends .
__label__noemo	How about we go to the yard sale first and then to the university flea market ?
__label__noemo	The Cathedral ?
__label__noemo	It's ages since I went to see a film .
__label__noemo	What was your childhood like ?
__label__noemo	All right . Just relax , OK ? Go and got a cup of coffee .
__label__noemo	no , I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't .
__label__noemo	Yes . We have an appointment at eight o ’ clock .
__label__noemo	Better luck this time !
__label__noemo	Yes.But Mary is no match for Susan in painting .
__label__noemo	Sure , just a second . All right , what time ?
__label__noemo	You can nod or ask questions at the right time to show that you have already understood or you are quite interested in his words .
__label__noemo	I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ?
__label__noemo	Yes , we do .
__label__noemo	Sounds like a pyramid scheme . Have you heard of those before ?
__label__surprise	What ? Are you kidding ?
__label__sadness	That's too bad . I need to discuss these plans with him .
__label__noemo	Our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes .
__label__joy	I ’ m so lucky . You only get a chance like this once in a blue moon ! Thanks honey !
__label__noemo	Come on ! In the two hours we've been here , you haven't sung even one song !
__label__noemo	Do you have a statement for your debit card ?
__label__noemo	What ’ s stopping you ?
__label__joy	That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ?
__label__noemo	ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting .
__label__noemo	Is it true that one of our competitors is planning to launch their tracking service next month ?
__label__noemo	What would you like to drink ?
__label__joy	Thanks for your help .
__label__noemo	For detailed information , however , you should read a history book .
__label__noemo	What's your problem then ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it might be worth it . I am not certain .
__label__noemo	Most of our clients prefer nonsmoking . Now , does a queen sound okay ?
__label__sadness	Well , I had a blood test last week . The doctor said that I have high blood pressure and my blood is thick and sticky . I'm very worried .
__label__noemo	Yes , I think so . And how about the price ?
__label__noemo	Thank you . Yes , I am Dunlin .
__label__noemo	It's all the same to me .
__label__noemo	2 months .
__label__noemo	This will be my first time using an ATM .
__label__noemo	Not long , because people rush for lunch .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry , sir . It's our policy .
__label__noemo	Why do you think you are qualified for this position ?
__label__noemo	They could generally be divided into two categories
__label__noemo	No way . Her old man is rich . He buys her anything she wants .
__label__noemo	May I see your library card , please ?
__label__noemo	OK , Sir . Would that be Fixed or Current Deposit ?
__label__noemo	Well , then , will you put this and that into doggie bags ?
__label__joy	What a lucky man .
__label__noemo	Honey , have you all packed ?
__label__noemo	I inspect the home for problems that might not be all that apparent in a quick walk-through .
__label__joy	Sure ! They are very fresh , first of all . We sell at a bargain , and you make a wise purchase if you buy them today . Eighty cents only , a piece .
__label__noemo	That ’ s good . Maybe you ’ ll get promoted .
__label__noemo	what do you think ? How does it taste ?
__label__noemo	I'll just go and check it for you , sir .
__label__noemo	Do you have a free moment ?
__label__noemo	That must have been stressful .
__label__noemo	Why don't we start unpacking these boxes ?
__label__noemo	Diana , do you like the perfume I gave you ?
__label__noemo	We'll get a big bonus this year , won't we ?
__label__joy	Congratulations ! By the way , have you had all the things ready for the interview ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Yes , I will check you for asthma , and maybe we can check you for allergies later .
__label__noemo	How about 15 % the first six months and the second six months at 12 % with a guarantee of 3000 units ?
__label__noemo	Here's your bill , sir . Could you please check it ?
__label__noemo	Yes , the Sunset Hotel is three blocks away . Maybe you can ask them .
__label__noemo	No , I shouldn ’ t think so . But you must take your passport of course .
__label__anger	Oh , my goodness . The traffic is crawling .
__label__noemo	That's not very fair . What did you do ?
__label__noemo	OK , I got it .
__label__noemo	No , it isn't mine . I blundered upon it under the sofa . Do youknow whose watch it is ?
__label__noemo	Yes . How much do you want ?
__label__noemo	Do you know what kind of salad that you want ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I wanna buy a skirt .
__label__noemo	I am just trying to find something that will pay the bills until this bad economy passes by .
__label__noemo	Okay , Tom .
__label__noemo	I will fax you a schedule as soon as I contact the owners to confirm the times .
__label__noemo	Yeah , but so what ! I ’ m proud to live in the world ’ s most exciting city . And , the salaries here are the highest in the nation , too .
__label__noemo	Jane , we are going to have a board meeting next Friday . Will you please arrange it for me ?
__label__noemo	Her room is very neat and clean .
__label__noemo	To get a little exercise . I'm so out of shape .
__label__noemo	Yes . This is a duty-free shop .
__label__noemo	Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ’ t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
__label__noemo	You are welcome .
__label__noemo	Ok , I will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . It has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . I am sure they don ’ t want to miss it .
__label__noemo	Let's make sure we are on the same page . Do we want a formal or informal gathering ?
__label__noemo	how much do are you looking to spend ?
__label__noemo	Here is my boarding pass.Can you tell me where my seat is ?
__label__surprise	Why ? You ’ re not satisfied anymore ?
__label__noemo	Oh , she enjoys spending money on fancy parties.Mona loves to wear sexy dresses , and she has quite a bit of jewelry .
__label__noemo	What kind of food do they serve ?
__label__noemo	Here are the stamps and your receipt .
__label__noemo	Yes , he is running for class president .
__label__noemo	I had some good financial news yesterday too .
__label__noemo	No , don ’ t use them , please .
__label__joy	With pleasure .
__label__noemo	Will that work ?
__label__noemo	Right you are . We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse .
__label__noemo	Sure . If you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . It ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective .
__label__noemo	Yes , I have some foreign currency to declare .
__label__noemo	I will allow one unexcused absence ; after that you need to contact me ahead of time .
__label__joy	Bottom is up .
__label__noemo	I'll talk to you later .
__label__noemo	When I was in LA , I met the WebTracker sales rep .
__label__noemo	if I taught you how to do it , I'm sure you could solve it .
__label__noemo	Silly boy . Green Food means the plants grown without using any chemicals , fertilizers , and pesticides .
__label__noemo	They ’ re both harder than reading or writing .
__label__noemo	I know . I wonder what's keeping him .
__label__noemo	I might be able to help ...
__label__noemo	Do most students in the United States attend private schools or public schools ?
__label__noemo	So , are we all ready to go ?
__label__noemo	It seems that nobody can always expect things to pan out well each time .
__label__noemo	Do you have any allergies that you know of ?
__label__joy	Donna , you really shocked everyone at the party last night !
__label__noemo	Could you introduce to me the man over there ?
__label__noemo	I know ! I never had the guts to tell you ... until today . So , what do you say ? Are you willing to give me a shot ?
__label__noemo	Sure , but it's so complicated . They asked for my credit card authorization number .
__label__noemo	What is your major ?
__label__noemo	When did you come back ? Did you have a good time ?
__label__joy	Enjoy yourself , sir .
__label__joy	Mario and I are the best students in the class.Miss.Parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
__label__noemo	Give me regular unleaded then . I will back up.Can you wash my windows for me ?
__label__noemo	Sorry , I overslept . My alarm clock didn't go off this morning .
__label__noemo	And these two ? They are husband and wife ?
__label__joy	Well , of course , the choice is up to you . Good luck !
__label__joy	With that dress I'd say your white diamond necklace would look perfect .
__label__noemo	Many.Most of the cities in the southern part of the United States are hot all year .
__label__noemo	Oh . Of course I'm ready .
__label__noemo	So I don't think you'll have a problem finding another girlfriend . There are plenty of fish in the sea !
__label__noemo	Wow , not long . Where do you live ? With a family ?
__label__noemo	You should take a look at all the companies , choose your favorite ones , go over to talk with the interviewer and leave your resume in the end .
__label__noemo	Mam , another minute , could I ?
__label__noemo	You wouldn't do a thing like that !
__label__joy	Thanks for saying that .
__label__noemo	Oops . Well , wait for a while . We'll get it done quickly .
__label__noemo	May I help you ?
__label__noemo	I'd better not . Brooke hates the Backstreet Boys !
__label__noemo	Will that be it ?
__label__noemo	You're right . I will have a talk to her about that .
__label__noemo	She asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be .
__label__noemo	Hello . I'm thinking about watching a Chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl . What's on this weekend ?
__label__noemo	Is it possible to change to another room ?
__label__noemo	Do you mean The Bangkok ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I've got a small room .
__label__noemo	Where do you see yourself five years from now ?
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__noemo	He was too desperate to find some other way .
__label__anger	You're darn Toomin ' , you know ! Now , you're on housework duty while I'm here !
__label__noemo	Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him ? He loves ' The King ' .
__label__noemo	Please sit down .
__label__noemo	What can I do for you ?
__label__surprise	really ? Is he married ?
__label__noemo	Can we talk ?
__label__noemo	I'm too careless .
__label__noemo	All you need is your student identification card to check out books .
__label__noemo	I think it says Temple City .
__label__noemo	I'm looking for a good multivitamin . Can you recommend one ?
__label__joy	Hi , Monica , congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company .
__label__joy	Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 .
__label__surprise	He likes American Idol very much , and he always imitates the contestant at home . I can't believe he got on the stage himself .
__label__surprise	I thought he usually wrote horror books .
__label__noemo	Yeah . I do it once a week .
__label__noemo	She will insist . It's a rosary . She has millions of them . Take it .
__label__noemo	Mr.Wang , we haven't discussed the mode of payment .
__label__noemo	I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it .
__label__noemo	It's in the International Trade Zone . It's only ten minutes'walk from the nearest subway station .
__label__joy	Excellent . Would you like anything else ?
__label__noemo	No time . That's their headlights in the window !
__label__noemo	it ’ s a beautiful city , but I think it ’ s become too touristy . How about going to a cosmopolitan city like Shanghai or Hong Kong ?
__label__noemo	Can you deliver it , please ?
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__noemo	Yes , here it is .
__label__noemo	What sports do you think women excel at most ?
__label__joy	Oh yes , I'm very interested in Chinese history so I ’ d like to visit the Summer Palace .
__label__noemo	to be honest , no . I'm always in search of new music to listen to .
__label__joy	Sounds like you are really getting in shape !
__label__noemo	Have you turned it on ?
__label__noemo	Posters are difficult to travel with . I think I'll just buy the postcards . I heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in Venice .
__label__noemo	This can ’ t wait ! I need your help now !
__label__noemo	Maybe you are right , so I will try my best to find a suitable job .
__label__joy	I'd be up for that !
__label__noemo	Yes , I was .
__label__joy	That ’ s an excellent idea . Hopefully , we would be able to make a profit ! A few professors and students are writing a book on the history of the university .
__label__joy	No , just a small one . Next let's sing ' Happy Birthday ' to Mary .
__label__noemo	You look so upset . What's going on ?
__label__noemo	Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics .
__label__joy	No problem . However , maybe I should come early to help you prepare the dinner .
__label__noemo	I'd like to have my hair cut .
__label__noemo	Are you ready to go shopping ?
__label__noemo	Read one of the street signs or something .
__label__surprise	Come on . Put the gun down .
__label__surprise	Really ? I can ’ t believe you actually found an apartment in the ads .
__label__surprise	I did ?
__label__noemo	My mother is a housewife .
__label__joy	Wei ! This is a first-you didn't bargain !
__label__joy	Yeah . Here ’ s my list . I ’ m not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though .
__label__noemo	When did you last time have your eyes checked ?
__label__noemo	Here are several sets of furniture , including sofa , dressing table , wardrobe , and sideboard . How about this one ?
__label__noemo	Honey , it's just windy and raining outside .
__label__noemo	I'm 32 .
__label__noemo	There are two different types that we are offering at the moment , Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit .
__label__noemo	I majored in Public Relations .
__label__noemo	yes , but I'm not sure which one to sign up for .
__label__noemo	As a rule we don ’ t allow any commission . But if the order is a substantial one , we ’ ll consider it .
__label__noemo	I know . You just add milk , eggs and a little oil to the baking mix and stir ...
__label__noemo	Perfect choice . For music , should we have a live band or a DJ ?
__label__joy	Philip , I was really glad to hear about your award . Congratulations !
__label__joy	Good news for us . When can you start to work ?
__label__noemo	You forgot all of about it , didn't you ?
__label__noemo	Do we have a 401K ?
__label__joy	That's OK with me .
__label__noemo	May I know the definite date of delivery ?
__label__noemo	He must have a good ear .
__label__fear	I am worrying about it too . I want to install a security door .
__label__noemo	yes , on a business trip . How about you ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it is almost new here .
__label__noemo	Could you handle flying for 24 hours straight ?
__label__noemo	Oh , you look kind of pale . What's the matter ?
__label__noemo	I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money form once currency t
__label__noemo	And that is mostly flat , right ?
__label__noemo	Well , I swim and run every day .
__label__noemo	Five . Besides my parents and me , there are my brother and sister .
__label__noemo	that's so true . thanks for your help . Are you in the aisle seat in this row ?
__label__noemo	This apartment is great , but could I upgrade a few things ?
__label__noemo	You didn't read their brochure or anything , did you ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it's very interesting .
__label__noemo	What's he doing ?
__label__joy	His parents must feel very happy .
__label__noemo	After you have your great idea , then you can set up shop by registering a domain name , creating a website , an email address , and a hosting service . If you want to go all out on your website , you can put together shopping cart technology , but that can be pricey to start out with .
__label__noemo	What are the requirements to apply for the position ?
__label__noemo	Is this your country of birth or residence .
__label__noemo	I see what you mean . That was pretty easy after all .
__label__surprise	Hi George ! It's good to see you !
__label__joy	You're right . I love it very much .
__label__noemo	I think first of all for first-time students , coming and living on campus in dormitories can provide a certain level of security .
__label__noemo	Yes . You are expected to know the e-mail address of the company .
__label__noemo	Do you know when it leaves ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry to hear that . Why do you think so ?
__label__noemo	Oh , just looking at these club notices . I'm thinking of joining one . Hey-why don't we join a club together ? How about the Tennis Club ?
__label__noemo	Why not go and find a porter ?
__label__noemo	I must say I think that is very odd . Are you absolutely certain it was her ?
__label__noemo	Would you please put it on the scale ?
__label__noemo	Nothing much . I ’ m going to the cinema on Friday night but that ’ s all I have planned .
__label__noemo	I'd like to be an overseas tour guide someday . Would there ever be any chance of that ?
__label__noemo	What would you consider your strengths ?
__label__noemo	I'm the manager . How can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Okay well listen , here is my business card with my mobile number . If any other questions spring to mind don ’ t hesitate to contact me . Of course you can also call Miss Childs too .
__label__noemo	He says he'll write a letter soon . He hopes we are all well . Love , Jimmy .
__label__joy	That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong.Perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
__label__noemo	Hi , welcome to Rental Property Management . How can I help you ?
__label__noemo	You sure are buying a lot of things online .
__label__noemo	How much is it to rent an economy car ?
__label__noemo	I must have slept right through it .
__label__joy	Thanks for coming over to help . I really appreciate it.First , could you peel the vegetables ? I ’ Ve put them all in the sink and there is a peeler .
__label__noemo	Where ?
__label__noemo	I'll measure you . . . You take size 6 . What colour hat would you like ?
__label__noemo	No . I'm busy then too . I'm meeting Dorothy Heath at North Bridge Road . Are you free on Thursday afternoon ?
__label__noemo	No , I don't . I get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients .
__label__noemo	Yes , it's still available .
__label__noemo	What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	I've enjoyed conversing with you .
__label__noemo	What do you mean ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s all I need .
__label__noemo	All right , Sis !
__label__noemo	I think you will find it quiet . It faces the courtyard .
__label__noemo	I remember Hugh . Most people thought he was a little ... uh ... peculiar . Do you know what he ’ s doing now ?
__label__noemo	It's a feature film .
__label__noemo	Actually , many jobs are filled by people who select vacancies from the display boards there .
__label__noemo	Ok , Ok . Toast and egg .
__label__noemo	I think you're right . Let's go .
__label__noemo	How about 560 436 4040 .
__label__noemo	Your father looks much younger in the picture .
__label__noemo	Yes , they did .
__label__noemo	It's a surprise !
__label__noemo	I know what you mean . I ’ m not only after bucks . There ’ s something more in life .
__label__noemo	No , thanks . I ’ Ve been trying to cut down on the caffeine .
__label__surprise	Are you serious ? It is always crowded with many people .
__label__joy	Yes . Especially in autumn , the red leaves of the maple trees make the whole mountain red .
__label__joy	That sounds great . Where should we meet ?
__label__joy	I know he ’ s going to be the next President .
__label__noemo	It's ok .
__label__noemo	Very good ! Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process that food and then expel the waste . Are we forgetting anything ?
__label__joy	I'd be glad to tell you what I think .
__label__noemo	Finally . How long does the tour last ?
__label__noemo	I'm afraid we don't . But I'm sure you'll enjoy our lunch special .
__label__noemo	I was wondering , does this come with any kind of warranty ?
__label__noemo	Good evening . Welcome to our program .
__label__noemo	By the way , hold your bag in case you vomit .
__label__joy	Oh , great idea !
__label__surprise	Really ? It's unbelievable .
__label__noemo	No , that's okay , I already have a coke.Why don't you have a seat , you look like you've been on your feet all day .
__label__noemo	Is there anything else you would like to have ?
__label__noemo	Good gracious ! You certainly are lucky . How are you going there ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I know her . We're friends .
__label__disgust	Gross !
__label__noemo	Ouch .
__label__noemo	I'm still a student .
__label__joy	That should work out great . You are miracle worker ! You have got me awake and motivated .
__label__noemo	Is our destination the amusement park ?
__label__noemo	Oh , it is my cell phone ringing . I set it in the vibration mode .
__label__noemo	Well , there are lots of things to consider . Quality and delivery times are as important as price . We also take into consideration technical support and after-sales service . We look for companies with a good track record . We place a few trial orders and if everything goes well , we put them on our approved list . It's important to choose companies you feel you can work closely with .
__label__joy	You are right . I am not boasting , but she is really as beautiful as she is intelligent .
__label__noemo	Oh , we always go to the movies.Can ' t we do something different ?
__label__noemo	Could you show me where the Chinesc-style clothing is located ? I want to buy a silk coat .
__label__noemo	Are your free this weekend ?
__label__surprise	It's hard for us to believe it . Our instruments have been the best quality for years . Have you any reliable evidence ?
__label__noemo	Do you like coffee , Ann ?
__label__noemo	Yes , there are many cities where it's almost always warm.San Diego , for example .
__label__noemo	Could you tell me the cost of production per unit ?
__label__noemo	Do you have an English name ?
__label__noemo	Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ?
__label__joy	Glad to meet you , too .
__label__disgust	There will be another sandstorm here tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Why do you say that ?
__label__noemo	Can you name some of the courses you completed in relation to accounting ?
__label__noemo	She has contributed to a new school .
__label__noemo	If you really think so , in my opinion you should give up this feeling completely .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__noemo	When would you like to return ?
__label__noemo	Sure thing . What are your plans for the evening ?
__label__sadness	I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us .
__label__noemo	No , thank you . I'll take an aspirin and see how it goes .
__label__noemo	What is the telephone number there ?
__label__noemo	No , but what time do you expect him back ?
__label__joy	Good luck .
__label__noemo	You can use quarters , dimes and nickels .
__label__noemo	Sure . 3 thirty this afternoon .
__label__noemo	Hi Joe . You met my new assistant , right ?
__label__noemo	That I can't go on any longer without you .
__label__noemo	Do you have a car ?
__label__noemo	I don't like Hamburgers . They have no taste .
__label__noemo	That ’ s fine . Can I move now ?
__label__joy	It does seem like the perfect day ! I ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! This looks like the perfect spot ! Ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up camp . Here , Mary , help me lay down these beach towels .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	It's Beethoven . Do you like it ?
__label__noemo	What time does the next showing of Forrest Gump begin ?
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__noemo	I am kind of confused .
__label__noemo	I have been yearning for a job as a stewardess in an airline like yours .
__label__noemo	Here is my passport . And this is the declaration form .
__label__noemo	You can bet on that .
__label__noemo	Hold on , please .
__label__noemo	What are the fundamental course ?
__label__noemo	Whatever . Give me another pack .
__label__noemo	She doesn't usually wear lipstick . She thinks it makes her nose look too big .
__label__noemo	Sure . Here is the code number , with information on how to use it .
__label__noemo	All you need to do is fill in the blanks correctly on the Continued Claim Form , and the EDD Office will take care of the rest .
__label__noemo	Ahahah ! ! ! Help me ! Help ! Bring the boat closer ! The shark is coming straight towards me !
__label__noemo	It could be that , or maybe you are eating too many sweets . In any case , I ’ ll administer an anesthetic and you won ’ t feel a thing !
__label__noemo	I know , we've met .
__label__noemo	How about taking a walk in the park ?
__label__noemo	If you take a taxi , it will be 20 minutes .
__label__noemo	With a Type B Account , it cannot be directly involved in any transaction and it cannot be applied to any external withdrawal service .
__label__noemo	I see , sir.Those two ladies in front of your room did the same thing twenty minutes ago .
__label__noemo	She was great . In today ’ s class , she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student . She told us not to arm for exams , and to pay more attention on communicating than memorizing .
__label__noemo	That's a bit more than I was prepared to pay .
__label__noemo	Rachel Jason .
__label__noemo	I said , I'm Ted , who are you ?
__label__joy	What about Tianqiao Temple Fair ? A variety of opera performances , acrobatics shows , and food will dazzle you .
__label__noemo	I know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him . But this doesn ’ t work , instead he picks up another bad habit .
__label__noemo	Do you want to mail it by air or by sea ?
__label__noemo	There isn't a lot , why , do you have a large load to wash ?
__label__surprise	why ? anything special there ?
__label__noemo	A new car for a start .
__label__surprise	What ? We are merging with Trusten ? I never thought that would happen.Will we be getting new owners ? Will it affect our jobs ?
__label__noemo	Nothing . Just that I don't care for these carrots.Hi , sis . , I saw you buy some chocolate cakes . I am done with the main course . It's about time for some dessert .
__label__noemo	I can't agree more . The only-child generation in China tends to know little about marriage .
__label__noemo	She is a teacher in a highschool , She teaches Chinese .
__label__joy	Yes , I do . Thank you .
__label__noemo	How much do are you looking to spend ?
__label__noemo	My next class is around there .
__label__noemo	Aren't you Jim Green ?
__label__noemo	My son likes going to the main post office . They have a philately counter where he can buy stamps for his collection .
__label__noemo	The steel sheets and bars come in , as you see , in different sizes and are unloaded onto the delivery bay here . We buy them in from a steel works in Wales . This is the new conveyor belt we installed last year . We doubled our output in this department as a result .
__label__noemo	Oh , I know exactly where that is .
__label__noemo	Yes . You'll be better in a few days , I'm sure .
__label__noemo	Well , I can't speak for all universities , but my salary is a definitely lower than at Lemans . I just don't think the salaries are comparable when you leave a major corporation .
__label__joy	Great . We can go to the swimming pool in the gymnasium after that .
__label__noemo	Do you get along with your roommates ?
__label__noemo	Your intention is good , but I still can't agree with you . If no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself .
__label__noemo	How much do I owe ?
__label__joy	Thank you . I am very happy to have my own office now . I ’ Ve never had one before . It is very nice .
__label__noemo	OK . We will make an announcement for you . Please leave your telephone number , we will call your as soon as we have your baggage .
__label__noemo	Does it hurt when I push here ?
__label__noemo	Runny nose and coughing .
__label__noemo	She can cope with it . Don ’ t be such a wimp !
__label__joy	Yes , I hope we meet again .
__label__noemo	Well , I am telling you now .
__label__noemo	Well , I know you ’ re pretty booked up these days . But , we ’ Ve got to work fast on this .
__label__noemo	What if the sale is made on the basis of sight draft ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , I can ’ t cook anything until tomorrow , anyway .
__label__noemo	Yeah , they are doing it for fun . Seldom would people like my exercise . It ’ s difficult and boring .
__label__noemo	Check the local time before you call . You don't want to wake your friend up by accident .
__label__noemo	Could I have a fresh towel ?
__label__noemo	I guess , here , give me 5,000 RIB worth . I might as well exchange a little extra . Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow !
__label__noemo	Yes . He must remain in bed for another two days . He can get up for about two hours each day , but you must keep the room warm . Where's Mr Williams this evening ?
__label__noemo	This way please . Your room is upstairs ... Here it is .
__label__noemo	Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up .
__label__noemo	Not quite yet .
__label__noemo	Oh ... I am really worried about the exam . I have no idea what will be on it .
__label__noemo	What a pity !
__label__joy	Excellent . How many would you like ?
__label__noemo	How much does it cost for a bus pass ?
__label__noemo	A growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over China .
__label__surprise	Are you kidding ? The meter says 15 dollars , doesn't it ?
__label__surprise	Didn't tell me what ? What ?
__label__noemo	That would make it easier for us to make plans .
__label__joy	That is a wonderful idea .
__label__noemo	Maybe you have a touch of the flu .
__label__noemo	Just a moment , please . I ’ ll see if she ’ s free .
__label__noemo	I'm going to leave around 4 O'clock .
__label__noemo	Is there a charge for that . I know other stores have a restocking fee .
__label__noemo	Is this the right bus , or not ?
__label__noemo	We are allowed to use a calculator in class ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , he came back from America last week .
__label__noemo	Then would you kindly come to our shop with the receipt by 10 o'clock ? We will replace it .
__label__joy	Anytime .
__label__noemo	I never watch foreign films . They're too boring .
__label__noemo	Is it in the other pocket ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s not my fault . Daniel always sends things flying .
__label__noemo	In that case , you ’ d better have it registered .
__label__noemo	Poor guy ! It's not fair . You forgot it too .
__label__joy	It certainly was a great party . It ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here .
__label__noemo	Yes . Will you ?
__label__noemo	Passport , please , madam .
__label__noemo	We should write our skills and let the company know we are competent for the job .
__label__noemo	Thank you . I'd like Chinese tea very much !
__label__noemo	They may have some difficulty in doing it .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes . Here it is .
__label__noemo	Charles Dickens .
__label__noemo	No , you don't have to . You only need to put your watch back ten minutes every day .
__label__noemo	I think you should definitely consider it ! This way you won ’ t have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you ’ ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . I can refer you this great
__label__noemo	Oh , that ’ s too bad .
__label__noemo	No . I am sure about that .
__label__joy	Hello , Jack.It ' s good of you to come .
__label__noemo	Sounds good . I'd like to take this flight .
__label__noemo	There is an area at the EDD Center that is set up with computers for you to make use of .
__label__noemo	But it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not .
__label__noemo	What section does it have ?
__label__noemo	He always says I am a hard worker with consciousness of responsibility , sufficient education , and enough experience .
__label__noemo	I had a nightmare last night and I dreamt Arden told me that my performance fell short of his expectation . I was terrified to wake up after hearing that .
__label__noemo	It depends .
__label__noemo	Can I help you , sir ?
__label__noemo	She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see .
__label__noemo	I think I'll sign a nine-month lease in case I decide not to go to summer school . I can extend it if I want to stay , can't I ?
__label__noemo	I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . Room 908 is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet .
__label__noemo	You can rest assured of that . So far , no customers have complained about our outer packing .
__label__noemo	Because the hottest season is summer in a year .
__label__joy	Well thank you ! In that case , I am 26 years old , and what about yourself ?
__label__noemo	Yes , quite a bit . How about a game sometime ?
__label__noemo	Do you grade on a curve or use percentages ?
__label__noemo	Then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it .
__label__noemo	It ’ s true . Many students do the exercise when they have to . We have P . E . once a week .
__label__noemo	How long have you been living in New York ?
__label__noemo	Hi Bob , how ’ s business ?
__label__noemo	So long as you learn from your mistakes .
__label__noemo	You did mess up on something .
__label__noemo	Me , either . But , it's for sure that the children market is a really big one .
__label__noemo	to tell the truth . i don't like it , it's too noisy .
__label__noemo	You mean we Chinese think differently from the Americans ?
__label__noemo	I think the best way I can do is to reduce our price by 2 % and I should think we could conclude a deal at $ 98 .
__label__joy	Me too . I ’ ll write to you once I get settled . But I have so much to do . You might have to wait a while . But I really will write to you . I love to write letters . I think it ’ s more meaning than the emails even than the phone call .
__label__noemo	It ’ s me , mum , I am sorry .
__label__noemo	Do you think that the service at post offices has improved ?
__label__noemo	Do you know him ?
__label__noemo	It'll take awhile , but I'm working on it .
__label__joy	Hi , Bill , this is my new car .
__label__noemo	Maybe when they become teenagers , they want to be completely different to their parents .
__label__noemo	Are you ready to leave ?
__label__noemo	Among those collections , which is the most expensive ?
__label__noemo	I always worry that the door is unlocked or that a window is open and that a stranger will come in and steal my things .
__label__joy	Not exactly , except that I find horoscope predictions increasingly accurate . I came upon a website which sends me an up-dated message by e-mail each day forecasting my experience in detail . It is amazing to find these forecasts largely in line with my daily life .
__label__noemo	Just asking ? But why is your face burning like mad ? Ah-huh , someone has a crush on Jenny , doesn't he ?
__label__noemo	I was sick .
__label__noemo	If we want to beat WebTracker , we're going to have to work hand in hand .
__label__noemo	What is a tornado warning ?
__label__noemo	But couldn't you have done it when you felt better ?
__label__noemo	Yes , that's exactly the bug I got . Though , I do kind of like the pictures .
__label__noemo	Do you know Abraham Lincoln ?
__label__noemo	Can I see your license , please ?
__label__noemo	Alright , do you have the receipt ?
__label__noemo	What's wrong with you ?
__label__joy	Spring is a lively season .
__label__joy	You , too . Where did you get your new hat ?
__label__noemo	176 Wooden Street East .
__label__noemo	Would you like a drink ?
__label__noemo	Well , you ’ re in luck ! You see , if you sign up for our three-year plan , we ’ ll throw in a handset for free .
__label__noemo	Yes , the same as the one we have . And we also need some small articles in the office , such as pens , clips , erasers and sticky notes .
__label__noemo	You must've been speeding .
__label__joy	I am calling to say thank you for the interview yesterday .
__label__noemo	Yes , I ’ d like to deposit one billion dollars .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid that I'm very ill .
__label__noemo	I think , maybe , it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile , I am no more than a beginner . But I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life .
__label__noemo	I know what you ’ re saying , but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy .
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry to hear that .
__label__noemo	that ’ s very generous of you . I guess that would work .
__label__noemo	No , that way is longer . There are more stop lights on that street .
__label__noemo	It looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ?
__label__noemo	How do you do ? I'm Bob Evans .
__label__noemo	Why not ?
__label__noemo	Verry sorry to have kept you waiting so long . What do you want , Madam ?
__label__noemo	That's true . You need to take some time off to relax .
__label__noemo	Mangoes . What are they ?
__label__noemo	We cannot expect a man like him to speak the truth .
__label__noemo	2,000 AD $ .
__label__noemo	If we go to Danshui in the morning on A weekday , we are sure to have seats since it's not during rush hour .
__label__noemo	OK ... well , then how much is one jin ?
__label__noemo	I calmed up . And finally , I asked her to chew the cud for such an important decision . I could not have the heart to disappoint her with a blunt refusal .
__label__surprise	Good gracious ! Are you sure ?
__label__noemo	I thought the movie about a serial killer who rapes and mutilates his victims would be a good choice .
__label__joy	Thanks . I finally got rid of that old Nissan that got me through college .
__label__anger	I wasn't done talking to you .
__label__sadness	There's nothing that can be done . Everything is gone . I wish I could tell you differently , but what has happened has happened . We will just have to figure out a way to move on .
__label__joy	Oh , they are playing the wedding March . Here they come .
__label__noemo	I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results .
__label__anger	They arrested me without probable cause .
__label__noemo	You'll recover after a good night's sleep .
__label__noemo	No . He's afraid that no one will cook as good as his mother did .
__label__noemo	I want to join in the bus tour .
__label__joy	Thanks . See you later .
__label__noemo	Is that the method you use here ?
__label__noemo	You apparently missed a court appearance .
__label__noemo	Your company has a very good reputation , and I have been planning to visit it for a long time . What's the advantage of your factory over other plastics ones ?
__label__noemo	Yes , there were no games in 1916 , 1940 and 1944 , because of World War I and World War II .
__label__noemo	It's a traditional family . It may be too large to live well .
__label__noemo	Do you think that you should go to the Student Health Center ?
__label__noemo	Is the officer that pulled you over here today ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s OK . Thank you for seeing me .
__label__noemo	The traffic is not very heavy on this high way , is it ? So I ’ m sure we ’ ll make it .
__label__noemo	Hi , Mark ! Long time no see !
__label__noemo	Right .
__label__noemo	Thank you , but I am in a terrible mood indeed .
__label__surprise	Are you nuts ? What would my friends think if they see me in a hired car ?
__label__noemo	About my boyfriend .
__label__noemo	Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening .
__label__noemo	Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ?
__label__noemo	"Well , since we're collecting gifts instead of red envelopes , I made a "" for guests only "" gift chat room ."
__label__noemo	Certainly .
__label__joy	Cheers !
__label__surprise	Mike ! Look at the floor !
__label__joy	Darling , I know you are a good husband . You don't have to work so hard . After all your health is the most important .
__label__noemo	What did you do last week ?
__label__noemo	We can do it when you have some time .
__label__noemo	Let me see . Here it is .
__label__noemo	We brought the price down only a few days ago . This is definitely a bargain .
__label__noemo	If you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving , you will get lots of exercise , too !
__label__noemo	That's right . I think we all have much we can learn from each other .
__label__noemo	how about cats ? Have you ever had one for a pet ?
__label__noemo	Oh , listen , I can ’ t even remember . Ok , on my birthday , I wandered into over 30 rooms , for a joke , sort of and he was there , and we started chatting ...
__label__noemo	Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop a clock .
__label__noemo	Who wants to go first ? Allen ?
__label__noemo	I can ’ t make out anything , the words are too light . I thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month .
__label__noemo	I will say it again ... Do you hear me now ?
__label__joy	Yes , I'll be glad to .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , sir . This is your passport .
__label__sadness	No ! Christmas without him is bad enough . So , honey , do you have cold feet yet ?
__label__noemo	That's right . Below the federal deductions are the state deductions . There's the state income tax , and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up , but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take .
__label__noemo	What do you think would be the right amount to tip ?
__label__sadness	Excuse me . My bag was stolen , will you help me ?
__label__noemo	Do you often suffer from backache ?
__label__noemo	Steven , I am ready for breakfast .
__label__noemo	I'm older than you ! I'll be ten on April 14th .
__label__noemo	Thank you , but the bus stops right at my house .
__label__anger	I really don't think it's any of your business .
__label__noemo	Maybe not . I think we should just focus on the retired people .
__label__noemo	How long did it take you to do the tiling .
__label__noemo	It sure is
__label__noemo	So what do you think it is ?
__label__surprise	Hey ! What happened ? ! My song was only half way through and it skipped to the next song .
__label__anger	So who does he think he is , anyway , I can't believe the way that my boss has been ordering everyone around lately , I mean , it's now like he is the CEO , or anything .
__label__joy	Thank you . Oh , it tastes excellent .
__label__noemo	how many rooms would it have ?
__label__noemo	All right , I see . Why do you want to work for a Sino-American joint venture enterprise now ?
__label__joy	Honey . The cottages harmonize well with the landscape.That tourist resort is worth travelling to .
__label__joy	It was so kind of you .
__label__noemo	Didn't you say your friend was American ? Where is she going on her honeymoon ?
__label__noemo	It's a bit too expensive . We can get it for six yuan in the shop next here .
__label__noemo	That's incredible . Could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
__label__noemo	Hi ! May I help you ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s quite large . It ’ s about 40 square metres .
__label__noemo	I think you are flicking through it .
__label__noemo	I was thinking of pizza .
__label__noemo	But Sunday is the same with Saturday . If you don ’ t mind , that's OK .
__label__noemo	See you .
__label__noemo	No , I'm not . I try and try and I still can't speak it very well .
__label__noemo	It has become more time saving .
__label__noemo	When did you come to America ?
__label__noemo	Did you get any ?
__label__noemo	Is everything alright ?
__label__noemo	Yes , please . Christin .
__label__noemo	Not paying attention to the speedometer ? Why not ?
__label__joy	That's great . I will go hiking with you .
__label__joy	Oh , yeah , A . Thank you for approving my job .
__label__joy	Can I give you a hand ?
__label__noemo	Hey , how could you like to taste my fist ?
__label__noemo	I propose we accept the minutes .
__label__noemo	what else can we do to protect the environment ?
__label__noemo	Well , if you ever want to visit Korea , I would be happy to show you around .
__label__noemo	Yup , a big potluck buffet . And then-notice there are no children around ?
__label__noemo	I sure do . In my opinion , it's actually becoming more expensive than back home .
__label__noemo	We're having some friends over.What are you doing ?
__label__noemo	Not really .
__label__noemo	I'll have to look . What do you want it for ?
__label__noemo	Maybe if you were a parrot . I wouldn't recommend it .
__label__noemo	Why don ’ t you try looking at the database ?
__label__noemo	Certainly , here you are .
__label__noemo	Right , and what about our friendliness and attitude ?
__label__noemo	All right , can I make an appointment right now ?
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__noemo	I don't know . It's hard . But I have to learn .
__label__joy	It definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city .
__label__joy	Oh , These are exactly what I ’ m looking for .
__label__noemo	Well , afternoon flight on December 10th to Shanghai . May I have your name , please ?
__label__noemo	This one is only 50 yuan .
__label__noemo	Ok , sounds good . But I think it's your trick .
__label__noemo	Magazines about fashions , such as Cosmo Polian .
__label__noemo	Yes , it is . Are you in a hurry , sir ?
__label__noemo	It is not your mother finding one for you ?
__label__joy	isn't it wonderful walking here ?
__label__noemo	You mean one for the city ?
__label__noemo	There ! ( Point out the direction . ) You can see a window there .
__label__noemo	I also grew up in a big family . I have one older brother and three younger sisters .
__label__noemo	Ah , hello Quinn . Oh dear , you are calling to tell me there is a problem , aren't you ?
__label__noemo	I like salads with croutons , almonds , and shredded cheese .
__label__noemo	What dose she look like ?
__label__noemo	don ’ t be moody ! I hope you ’ re not tired , because we ’ Ve been invited to a party this evening . I know how excited you get about parties .
__label__noemo	Hello . Do you know how I can find a room to rent ?
__label__noemo	Hello , can I help you ?
__label__joy	if I were you , I'd apply for some scholarships and grants before you decide . Whatever you do , I know you'll succeed .
__label__noemo	It says smoking is not allowed in any private offices . It might be the most terrible thing for you .
__label__noemo	Your order will be ready soon , thank you for calling .
__label__noemo	How long has this been happening ?
__label__noemo	I have a reservation . My name is John Sandals .
__label__noemo	Thank you for your directions . It's clear .
__label__noemo	I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex .
__label__noemo	There are many interesting places you should be sure to see . One problem is transportation , however . Because the city is very old , the roads are narrow and congested . If you only have three or four days to visit , you don't want to spend them waiting in traffic in a cab . I suggest you take the subway .
__label__noemo	How about we go to the flea market today ?
__label__noemo	You have to listen to what the client asks for . What you have just shown me is not at all in line with the client ’ s wishes .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry to make you wait . What did you decide ?
__label__noemo	It usually gets here at noon on Tuesday , which is tomorrow .
__label__noemo	So are we , our counter-offer is in line with the world market .
__label__noemo	I won't be long . No more than ten minutes . Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s easy to say , but I will try .
__label__joy	No , no , no . I'm just browsing . Thanks anyway .
__label__noemo	I just started working here .
__label__noemo	Why are you considering trying for it ?
__label__noemo	Do you want me to show you where I found them ?
__label__noemo	This is John .
__label__noemo	Nigel Smith . Does he have your number , Mr . Smith ?
__label__noemo	Yes , several times .
__label__noemo	Well , I'm afraid I must be going now . I have no idea it was so late .
__label__noemo	well , he was supposed to be able to learn his job in 30 days , but he just doesn't seem to know what he's doing .
__label__noemo	I really want to go to the movies this weekend .
__label__noemo	So , then why did you speed up ?
__label__noemo	Hi . What's up ?
__label__noemo	Hi , Daisy !
__label__noemo	What do you know about Julia Roberts ?
__label__joy	That's pretty good . By the way , what are you doing next Saturday ?
__label__noemo	What do you think about violence in movies ?
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	I know , but things are getting a bit out of hand and I just can ’ t do nothing .
__label__noemo	When will you buy it then ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , it's not that long of a trip .
__label__noemo	Well , You'd better get some more warm clothes .
__label__noemo	Have you talked to him ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it sure does . And with our new premises , we have new services . We can provide 24 - hour support for your Wealth Management .
__label__noemo	May I speak to Marry Lin please ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry , but I can ’ t find the book that you lend me .
__label__noemo	Can you tell me how to send one on it ?
__label__noemo	Where do you usually do your shopping , Mrs . Lane ?
__label__noemo	Hey , Robert , that's a nice shirt you are wearing . Where did you get it ?
__label__noemo	Ok . Here you are . Is that all right now ?
__label__noemo	Well , I'm staying at the YMCA at the moment . I'm looking for somewhere more permanent . Do you know of any good places ?
__label__noemo	I made my little brother cry .
__label__joy	Not bad . How about you , John ?
__label__joy	That ’ s very generous of you . I guess that would work .
__label__noemo	Are you an art aficionado ?
__label__noemo	What's that book you have under your arm ?
__label__noemo	Dutch , where is that ?
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__sadness	Doctor , save my baby , please
__label__noemo	You can have a room on the second floor .
__label__noemo	Can you assure the quality of this air conditioner ?
__label__anger	Why ? It's in mint condition !
__label__noemo	Don ’ t count on it . I think the best way to prevent AIDS is to keep yourself clean by having clean sex and keeping a regular sex partner .
__label__noemo	that depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year .
__label__disgust	I didn't really like it .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t count on it .
__label__noemo	Did you watch the live telecast of the World Cup last night ?
__label__noemo	No , early saturday morning .
__label__noemo	Thank you , sir . But I'm not allowed to accept any tips .
__label__noemo	No , they ’ re a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing .
__label__noemo	Can you reduce more ?
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Then open that window . Yeah , that one .
__label__noemo	yes . I would be directly responsible for all of the sales representatives in my department . I assume there'd be more meetings , paperwork , and other responsibilities , too .
__label__noemo	That explains it .
__label__joy	ah . That can wait . Your promotion is the best news I've heard in a long time !
__label__noemo	Can't bear it , right ? I've been there before . I'll feel uncomfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages , like there is something missing .
__label__noemo	Just fine . I say . Aren't you busy tomorrow evening ?
__label__noemo	I like this T-shirt . Would you like to help me look for any skirts that go with it ?
__label__noemo	I suppose you ’ re right , Lee . Maybe that ’ s why so many Westerners are overweight .
__label__noemo	So many dishes . Next Friday week is my birthday . I would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , OK ?
__label__noemo	Cruise control ? I don't like that .
__label__noemo	When did you decide to become a vegetarian ?
__label__noemo	When I tried to back it , I found it was out of order . I can't see where the trouble is .
__label__noemo	Do you speak English ?
__label__sadness	It sounds too bad . What will you do ?
__label__noemo	I'll need them for the conference on Monday afternoon.Do you think it can be done by then ?
__label__noemo	Do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of English-speaking countries ?
__label__noemo	I'm afraid so . I'm terribly sorry .
__label__noemo	What kind of people do you like to work with ?
__label__noemo	I think you'd better have a further exam , and before the result comes out , try to relax yourself and take the medicine before you sleep . It will help you to kill the pain and make you sleep well .
__label__noemo	If you take an antihistamine , that would help a lot .
__label__noemo	Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .
__label__noemo	Hey , Jim . I didn ’ t know you biked to work .
__label__noemo	I've only washed my white clothes .
__label__noemo	Anna , Would you like to dance ?
__label__noemo	I really don't care , just go to sleep .
__label__joy	Oh , that's OK . Let's just meet at the theater before the show , around 7:30 .
__label__noemo	Well , I need an economy ticket .
__label__noemo	No one has ever checked me for allergies .
__label__noemo	Tell me why you saw the movie twice .
__label__noemo	Pardon me ?
__label__noemo	No , I'm used to having tea first .
__label__noemo	Have a briefcase ready with all your interview materials in it for easy carrying .
__label__noemo	Some people say that history repeats itself .
__label__noemo	I want to know how to buy something from this machine .
__label__joy	Thanks for letting me know .
__label__noemo	I want you to be on time for school today .
__label__noemo	And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common .
__label__noemo	Yes , does the renting include utilities ?
__label__noemo	Indeed , it's unfair . Households with higher salaries receive larger LPF contributions and thus qualify for larger loans . Lower-income households , on the other hand , can only get smaller loans , or perhaps nothing if they could not afford to purchase any housing .
__label__noemo	Well , I ’ m afraid it isn ’ t . It ’ s a bit too well done and rather tough . Would you mind changing ?
__label__joy	Yes . Will it hurt us ?
__label__noemo	I'm not sure I'd want to give these people my credit card number .
__label__noemo	A medium is fine for me .
__label__noemo	Without doubt , rock is trash .
__label__noemo	The jacket is tight in the shoulders and long in the sleeve . What about the price there ?
__label__noemo	Let's do something different today .
__label__joy	Good . Listen . I'm phoning because I want to invite you to a party . At our Newhouse . And . .
__label__noemo	All right . If we decide to hire you , we'd pay you 5,000 yuan a month at the start . How do you think about it ?
__label__joy	if you haven't tried Beijing duck yet , I'd like to treat you to a meal at a famous duck restaurant near Qianmen . It would be a pity if you left without tasting it !
__label__noemo	O . K . Let me see . That will be $ 104.99 .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	My parents wanted me to stay in Beijing , but I decided to go back to England . I graduated from University of Newcastle upon Tyne with a degree in Cross Culture Communication .
__label__noemo	Do you mind if I speak frankly ?
__label__joy	I know your friend will like the gift set , especially the teddy bear .
__label__noemo	That's all . Here's your bank card , and here's the certificate of deposit . Bring your bank card with you every time you come to deposit or withdraw money .
__label__joy	That's great , congratulations !
__label__noemo	What do you mean ?
__label__noemo	Do we need to show our ID cards when checking in ?
__label__noemo	What do you do ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s right . Make sure you give the accounts department all your bank account details as soon as possible .
__label__noemo	OK , sir . I have added your name to the waiting list.We will call you as soon as possible .
__label__noemo	When are you going to make it ?
__label__noemo	Of course . We are always at your service .
__label__noemo	I see . We will go the day after tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Maybe . I haven ’ t been able to keep my food down either . That ’ s unusual .
__label__noemo	it's ok . She normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder , and I wouldn't know what shade to buy .
__label__noemo	Neither have I .
__label__disgust	Haha ... You are not very funny . I guess that means - - except me to tell my lover we have stoped seeing each other too .
__label__noemo	Have you anything to ask about the job ?
__label__joy	Ahahah , and I thought you were tired .
__label__noemo	Thank you . Do I have to pay in advance ?
__label__noemo	Thank you , please fill out this form for us .
__label__noemo	I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan of action , but I doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late .
__label__noemo	I think we should do the floors before we work on the curtains and walls .
__label__noemo	Me either , but I ’ m dealing with it anyway .
__label__noemo	Italian . They played very well , but they were not very lucky .
__label__noemo	No , I cann't . I'm in a hurry !
__label__noemo	You're new at this , huh ?
__label__noemo	Want to send out for some Chinese ?
__label__noemo	Where do you want to go ?
__label__joy	I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older .
__label__joy	You can learn Chinese checkers or military chess . Both of them are much easier .
__label__joy	that's what everyone says ! I can't wait to see it for myself some day .
__label__noemo	How will I know how much I can collect on unemployment ?
__label__noemo	Go ahead .
__label__noemo	Not yet . Can you give me some suggestions ?
__label__noemo	Here's a twenty .
__label__noemo	Right . Well it seems like you have all your bases covered . What ’ s next ?
__label__noemo	No , thank you . I'm on a diet .
__label__noemo	Yes , I can .
__label__joy	Don't be so shy , Lucy .
__label__noemo	It'll be about an hour . Are you going to wait ?
__label__noemo	Here you are , sir . Bourbon with iced water .
__label__noemo	Because I won't let it fail .
__label__noemo	you bet it !
__label__noemo	Why use wooden cases ?
__label__noemo	Can you sew on these buttons ?
__label__noemo	OK , I know now .
__label__surprise	( looking at a newspaper ) Oh , dear me ! There's no performance at the National theater this weekend . So we have to go to cinema instead .
__label__noemo	Next Today . By the way , is there a closed circuit TV ?
__label__noemo	All right , I see . So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now .
__label__noemo	That would be great !
__label__joy	I hope you like it .
__label__noemo	No problem , is this blue ok ?
__label__joy	It's great ! The mountains here are beautiful and the skiing is spectacular.Have you been here for a long time ?
__label__noemo	Because I want to tell you about the time that I saw a ghost .
__label__joy	It's my greatest pleasure to have met you.See you around .
__label__noemo	Thank you . It's my honor .
__label__noemo	He won the first place !
__label__noemo	We may come at 6:30 p . m .
__label__noemo	Sorry , sir . We accept cash only .
__label__noemo	Here you are . Taste the French fries .
__label__noemo	My advantage is that I have strong sense of responsibility . But I lack patience .
__label__noemo	I know . I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst .
__label__noemo	You do realize that I will need to rip down your wall to get to the pipe , right ?
__label__noemo	You say he was around average hight .
__label__noemo	Again , as you see on your course outline , grading is determined by your performance on a midterm and a final test , periodic quizzes , and classroom participation .
__label__joy	I just did what I should have done .
__label__noemo	I'll teach you .
__label__joy	He said that I put all other girls in the shade .
__label__noemo	Did you like your work ?
__label__joy	Can I stop by ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s great ! I can have two bags checked for 70 pounds each . I think I ’ m all set . You ’ re really efficient . Thank you very much for your help .
__label__noemo	How can it be ?
__label__noemo	Hi , taxi.Could you take me to the financial street , please
__label__noemo	He's been compared to Rimbaud , you know .
__label__noemo	Can you eat the nut ?
__label__noemo	Two months ? How did you find out ?
__label__noemo	Single or return , sir ?
__label__noemo	Look at the flowers over there . What are they ?
__label__noemo	Do you see them a lot ?
__label__noemo	All right . When can I start ?
__label__noemo	unfortunately not . If I can't find anything in the field , then I could also work in the tourism field .
__label__noemo	Yes . Is this your new product this year ?
__label__noemo	First , as far as I know , your company has had an impressive growth record . Second , I want to get into the foreign trade business .
__label__noemo	Apple , banana and strawberry pie .
__label__noemo	don't worry . Family comes first . Come on , let's go .
__label__noemo	Why are you going to take english with chemistry and physics ?
__label__noemo	I thought this was the right stop .
__label__disgust	Sure it is . I really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
__label__noemo	Do you have any tables ?
__label__joy	I bet . You must be stoked .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry , sir . Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage , at twenty kilograms each , plus one piece of carry-on luggage . I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase .
__label__surprise	Really ? Me , too . I work for an accountancy company , T & D . Maybe you've heard of them .
__label__joy	Well , you have fun .
__label__noemo	He ’ s huge ! He must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that .
__label__noemo	Welcome to Galant . How can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Okay . Keep in touch .
__label__noemo	Hello , this is Wang Lu and I am calling to confirm my reservation .
__label__noemo	That ’ s fine . Thanks .
__label__noemo	Good . We should tell our neighbour that they can call the police if some emergency happens to us .
__label__joy	Good . If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong .
__label__joy	Maybe . Oh , I see the Jungle Flying Train . I once rode it . It was very exciting .
__label__noemo	When do you want me to come ?
__label__noemo	What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Half past seven in the morning .
__label__noemo	Yes , I ’ ll pay for the call . Put her through , please .
__label__noemo	OK , you're the boss . Look , Mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool .
__label__noemo	Hello . Front desk . How can I help you ?
__label__noemo	When I opened the account with you , I was a student , I graduated a couple of years ago and have a steady salary , so I figured now would be the best time to go ahead .
__label__joy	What shall we do after the volleyball match ?
__label__noemo	Take it easy . I have the confidence to learn it well .
__label__noemo	Can I help you , madam ?
__label__noemo	I don ’ t think it makes sense . Three minutes is such a short time .
__label__noemo	Yes . Do you accept traveler's checks ?
__label__noemo	No , that ’ s not true . I ’ Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese . But those Chinese look very strong and healthy . So if you exercise more often , I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls . How old is Jacky Chan ? He ’ s small and short . But I bet he can have any American woman he wants .
__label__noemo	Could I have my bill , please ?
__label__sadness	Everything's gone wrong .
__label__noemo	Mr . Smith , I would like to get right to the point here . First , we need to talk about how much each company will pay .
__label__noemo	I call the landlord right now .
__label__noemo	Yes . Here you are .
__label__noemo	Thank you very much for telling me all these things about the college .
__label__noemo	What job-related skills do you have ?
__label__joy	You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . I'll have a beer please
__label__noemo	So can you fix it ?
__label__noemo	do you need a hand ?
__label__noemo	I ' m afraid he didn ’ t leave one .
__label__noemo	Well , that is also very efficient , right ?
__label__noemo	Well , tell me something of yourself .
__label__noemo	What ’ s wrong ? Slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack .
__label__joy	Yeah . It is incredible ! Is it the work of Qi Bakshi ?
__label__noemo	What was the rate yesterday ?
__label__noemo	Sure . Do you want it to be registered ?
__label__noemo	Hi , Francis , morning ! How are you doing today ?
__label__noemo	Hey , Tom , did you enjoy your lunch ?
__label__noemo	Mr . Lee , all ready to check out ? We ’ Ve already prepared your bill , and housekeeping has done a quick check of the room . How will you be paying ?
__label__noemo	well , to be honest with you , Chinese food is really different from western food .
__label__noemo	I don't think so . That way it would lose all the charm . I want it to be a surprise . I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last .
__label__joy	Me , too .
__label__noemo	Do they have it in LARGE .
__label__joy	Certainly , Sir .
__label__noemo	Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ?
__label__noemo	What did you think of it ?
__label__noemo	I see . How about this one ? It's very fashionable and popular among teenagers .
__label__noemo	How about the tires ?
__label__noemo	In that case , I ’ ll get you to fill out this paperwork . I ’ ll need your social insurance number , and two pieces of government ID . If you could just sign here , and here , and here we ’ ll be all set . Would you like to make a deposit today ?
__label__noemo	Yes , fine .
__label__joy	I ’ ll be glad to help .
__label__noemo	Right there .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , what is this ?
__label__anger	How dare you accuse me of stealing your computer ?
__label__noemo	Sorry , here .
__label__noemo	Should I tell my bank that I have made an offer ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to , but I am very busy .
__label__noemo	Yeah , but I'm still waiting for my invitation .
__label__joy	I ’ Ve made a lot of new friends since I started learning English . Maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends .
__label__noemo	Let me see . It's £ 800 per set CIF London .
__label__noemo	Wow . She looks good for having had that many kids . She's pregnant and wearing Prada !
__label__noemo	Make it special delivery , please .
__label__noemo	Well , the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulty getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts .
__label__noemo	There's a copy machine on the first floor in our computer lab , sir .
__label__noemo	Do you take reservations ?
__label__noemo	Yes , we want to stay in the ABC School District .
__label__fear	I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .
__label__noemo	What ’ s the result ?
__label__noemo	What do you mean ?
__label__noemo	Are you OK there ?
__label__noemo	Well , maybe the net is slow now . Try it again .
__label__noemo	yes.In fact , maybe we could go together .
__label__noemo	I believe so .
__label__noemo	the train ? Will I be flying back then ?
__label__noemo	Wait ! Don't go just yet . These bananas are pretty cheap--only 35NT for this bunch .
__label__noemo	Sorry . I think that's the cheapest
__label__noemo	Sir , you didn't fill out the information on your arrival card of where you will be staying .
__label__noemo	Would you like to come to our party ?
__label__noemo	How do I know if it's ripe ?
__label__surprise	Phew ! . . . Wait a minute , CRASH ? ? ! ! Spyware ? Trojans ! What ? where ? when ? !
__label__noemo	I really wanted you to come , but I understand .
__label__noemo	Sure . Is there anything else I can get for you ?
__label__noemo	Hi , John . What brings you to town ?
__label__anger	It's taking you forever to do my hair .
__label__noemo	yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry .
__label__noemo	Good morning . There is no reason to miss so beautiful a morning . Is that a new bird ?
__label__noemo	Shall we have some white wine then ?
__label__noemo	When can I take my test ?
__label__noemo	I know . Stay with me . She then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . First , though , she had to discover her true cat nature . At the end she had a big fight with Sharon Stone , who was the real danger in the company . She had actually murdered the boss , who was her husband , and then tried to frame Batwoman for the murder , so everyone thought Batwoman was evil .
__label__anger	Don ’ t touch that thermostat ! You don ’ t pay the bills around here !
__label__noemo	$ 80 .
__label__noemo	There ’ s a possibility . What do you say ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Do you have a package tour to Paris ?
__label__noemo	He quit
__label__noemo	Yup , better for the environment and better for us !
__label__noemo	Just pick up a tray , then put a knife , a fork , a spoon and a paper napkin on it and stand in the line .
__label__noemo	Alright , alright . Let me look at that pamphlet.Hmm . Alessio's Pizza Parlor . That's cool . I go there all the time.And Cosmo's Club . And 4 - D records . Alright . How much does it cost ?
__label__noemo	She sure knows how to strut her stuff .
__label__joy	I like the way that the gifts I get increasingly more lavish .
__label__joy	That's perfect .
__label__joy	I sure am . So what about you ? How did you feel when you graduated ?
__label__noemo	The most important thing to do is to make sure you know the company and what services or products it provides . Do you know all about them ?
__label__noemo	Can you call an Ambulance ?
__label__noemo	( quietly ) I don't understand what the teacher is saying .
__label__noemo	She has a yellow dress on and red sneakers .
__label__noemo	But if it's their mistake , can I get an extension on my bill payment ?
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	why not ? I don't have anything better to do !
__label__noemo	I'm still suffering from a little jetlag .
__label__noemo	The late fee is 25 cents a day .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	I know , but there was nobody else .
__label__noemo	I was . It ’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won ’ t be able to home because I can ’ t afford the airfare . I ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family .
__label__noemo	Yes , I think so .
__label__noemo	There ’ s a train at 7 a . m . It'll get you there at 11 a . m . But there are many stops along the way .
__label__noemo	I see Mike farmer has make it into the Olympic team . He beat the national record by 0.1 of a second .
__label__noemo	I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up .
__label__noemo	OK . I have written it down . Who is your emergency contact person in America ?
__label__noemo	We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary .
__label__noemo	As a matter of fact , I'm from Taiwan .
__label__noemo	How much are they ?
__label__surprise	Oh , a cat ? Come on .
__label__noemo	Yes it is , better than I expected it would be.The presenters have been first rate.Is this the first conference you've been to ?
__label__noemo	Mary , how was your date with john ?
__label__noemo	What about a factory tour ?
__label__noemo	No , not at all .
__label__noemo	I need help figuring out how to use this phone .
__label__noemo	If everyone could take a look at the final review handout , if there're any objections or corrections , let me know . Next week , we can cast the final approval .
__label__noemo	If you are going to husband hunting in a bikini , then I want to wear one , too .
__label__noemo	Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome !
__label__joy	At 8P M tomorrow night .
__label__noemo	If you have exactly the same one-same color , same design , and same size , of course .
__label__joy	That sounds great . Where are you going ?
__label__joy	OK .
__label__noemo	No , he didn't want to leave , but his wife did !
__label__noemo	You won't believe what just happened .
__label__joy	Sounds good .
__label__joy	It ’ s my honor .
__label__noemo	Have we got any beer and wine ?
__label__anger	I won't be paying you for this .
__label__noemo	In order to graduate , every student must take a certain amount of classes in history , math , English , philosophy , science and art .
__label__noemo	I really don't like the winter . I wish it were summer .
__label__noemo	Hello , Mr . Clark . You ’ re early for lunch . It ’ s only eleven o ’ clock .
__label__noemo	Thank you so much . By the way , is there a mail service ?
__label__noemo	Of course , just remember that all of the needed information is on the card .
__label__surprise	No . The Hills ? Who filed for divorce first ?
__label__noemo	We like a larger wardrobe .
__label__noemo	What was the last movie you saw ?
__label__noemo	you know , foreigners are not expected to use chopsticks proficiently . If you do , you'll give your Chinese friends quite an impression .
__label__noemo	Is there any way we could get a better warranty on this product ?
__label__noemo	Do you like playing table tennis ?
__label__noemo	Keep your eyes on the road ! No music ! We are coming up to a red light , step on the brakes . What are you doing ? I said the brakes ! Look out for those people ! Get off the sidewalk !
__label__joy	Are you busy on the 24th ?
__label__joy	Yes , of course . It's really worth visiting .
__label__noemo	I am impatient with myself at times and am hard on myself .
__label__noemo	I think so . You can get anywhere by bus and taxi is not expensive .
__label__noemo	Show us our itineraries , please .
__label__surprise	Oh , no , you can't be serious . I never expect anything like this would happened . What are we going to do ?
__label__joy	About 4 .
__label__noemo	Where do I sign up for my benefits package ?
__label__surprise	That's a high price .
__label__joy	Yes , everything has been well designed .
__label__noemo	Coing out for a walk .
__label__noemo	How long a period will you look at to determine this ?
__label__noemo	What are they ?
__label__noemo	See you .
__label__noemo	We also hope to expand our business with you .
__label__noemo	No . Did you want to go do something ?
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	Thanks a lot .
__label__noemo	What can you expect with this crowd ? I am praying that no one will cut in the line .
__label__noemo	I'm going to have to do some more research into this . Thanks for your help , bye for now .
__label__joy	No problem . I'll tell you .
__label__surprise	Come on , You hit the high notes perfectly !
__label__noemo	Poor cat .
__label__noemo	The binders have current local jobs listings and the computer jobs lists are good too . Understand ?
__label__noemo	When can I move into my new house ?
__label__noemo	What is it used for ? I mean , why bother to get this special account ?
__label__noemo	I have had an incredible boss , who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience . A-bout two months after I began working for her , she really let me spread my wings . She encouraged me to work independently , because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment . So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day . Of course , I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports , although she didn't specifically ask me to . Without her support and encouragement , I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time . But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change . I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs . And while I'd certainly prefer to work for one like I've just described , I'm the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone .
__label__joy	How lovely it is !
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	What ’ s up ? You don ’ t look too good .
__label__joy	Thank god you are open ! I have an emergency !
__label__noemo	I'm doing my best , Grandma ...
__label__noemo	It lasts for 9 months .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , I haven't decided yet . Do you mind giving me a couple of minutes ?
__label__noemo	Do you know where the visa office is ?
__label__noemo	You are welcome . And , please call me Betty .
__label__noemo	That ’ s all right .
__label__joy	Anyway , it's my ideal coat . I'll take it .
__label__noemo	I feel sick .
__label__noemo	Ok , sue , I will just go in get her .
__label__noemo	Nice to meet you , Lvan.My name is Alike . I'm from Japan .
__label__noemo	Oh , thank you . Your skirt looks beautiful , too .
__label__joy	Look , Forest Gump is on at six thirty .
__label__surprise	Really ? Tell me more .
__label__joy	Sure sounds good to me .
__label__noemo	I slept like a baby . I fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have nay nightmares !
__label__noemo	I am not really sure that I remember how to even put a resume together .
__label__noemo	I don't know .. Well , maybe you are right , but how am I gonna tell her ?
__label__noemo	What's the matter with you , Paul ?
__label__sadness	I'm afraid I forgot to lock the door .
__label__noemo	He must be very easy-going .
__label__joy	It's a pleasure .
__label__noemo	Tell me about it ! We drank everything in the bar !
__label__noemo	Yes , I think it is possible more important than the salary .
__label__joy	Well , I have no regrets !
__label__noemo	what do you think about abortion ?
__label__joy	I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring .
__label__noemo	Jeez . Tourists .
__label__noemo	Would you like to have this kind of suitcase ?
__label__noemo	I think so.Could I have you name , telephone number ? If we get one , I will call you .
__label__noemo	Well , we have many models to choose from here.Do you have a particular brand you want ?
__label__joy	Well , black people are supposed to be great dancers .
__label__noemo	Ohhhhh ! And I just got all my juices going !
__label__noemo	Would you like this one ?
__label__noemo	Is this all right ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I am .
__label__noemo	I've got some cigars .
__label__noemo	When do you start ?
__label__noemo	Wow . You look great .
__label__joy	Thank you for calling .
__label__noemo	No , this isn't .
__label__noemo	Tom , did you see the film last night ?
__label__joy	I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy .
__label__noemo	Since everyone is different , your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . Then you'll be taught all the necessary techniques to use these equipments and achieve your goal .
__label__noemo	Until two in the morning . But you don't have to stay that long.Well ? What about it ?
__label__joy	No wonder your English is so good .
__label__noemo	Of course , it can be done right this minute . If you could just fill in this application form for me ? Do you have your ID card with you ? I'll need to see that .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Alright , no problem .
__label__noemo	I wish it could be Germany . But it seems they are not in a very good conditions .
__label__noemo	Tarzan .
__label__noemo	Yes . Do you intend to order a Lacarne or will you be having our seafood buffet ?
__label__joy	They're probably going to be so happy .
__label__noemo	No . Someone had stolen a march on me and bought it .
__label__noemo	I suppose my strong point is that I like developing new things and ideas .
__label__noemo	What do you think is the role teacher should play in the classroom ?
__label__noemo	My pronunciation is not very good . It's L-I-N , Lin .
__label__noemo	Okay , you are all set , Mr . Armstrong . Enjoy your flight !
__label__noemo	Sure . Does she know your friend ?
__label__noemo	Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas .
__label__noemo	Now that we know what kind of music we will play , we have to decide what each of us will do .
__label__noemo	Good evening , sir . What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital .
__label__noemo	Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .
__label__noemo	All right . I will begin boarding soon .
__label__noemo	He would think you were crazy , Caroline .
__label__noemo	You ’ re right . I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . I would hate living in the country !
__label__noemo	Well , that depends . What's the rate like today ?
__label__noemo	You'd better get on with your homework ! You can practice on Sunday .
__label__noemo	I do wish I could lose weight .
__label__noemo	Sure , will there be anything else that I can get you ?
__label__noemo	what was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ?
__label__noemo	A :: So , Wily , you have been with IBM for two years , ready for change ?
__label__joy	Well done .
__label__noemo	I feel much better , but I'm still worried about something .
__label__noemo	You can always take it again .
__label__noemo	You mean liquor has a higher tax than other things ?
__label__noemo	I'd like a hamburger and a cup of coffee.My room number is 402 .
__label__noemo	I guess I need all of them .
__label__noemo	I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails .
__label__noemo	Not bad . Have you heard Wendy divorced her husband ?
__label__noemo	well , I grew up in Africa , so I learned quite a few different languages .
__label__noemo	That ’ s rather hard .
__label__noemo	I see . They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements .
__label__noemo	I ’ m sure he would . We usually have to drag him home .
__label__noemo	Oh , yeah , smarty-pants ? Over my dead body . Now , don't be such a brat and ...
__label__noemo	She wished good luck to you .
__label__noemo	Everybody has their strengths and weaknesses.Even Larry.He might be a pain to be around , but he's also very good at staying in budget on projects.Mary , on the other hand , spends our project money like there's no tomorrow.Also , she's never willing to stay a little later at the office.She always leaves at 5pm sharp .
__label__joy	That's good thinking .
__label__noemo	You are welcome , goodbye .
__label__noemo	You are the leading company in the computer industry .
__label__noemo	Fine , I'll take 10,000 RIB , please .
__label__joy	It ’ s a pleasure to meet you , Miss Green .
__label__noemo	Do you want anything to go with soup ?
__label__noemo	Glad to tell you . The price of CPU is 300 dollars .
__label__noemo	that ’ s true . Right . I ’ m going back to the meeting . It ’ s been going on for hours and there ’ s no indication that it ’ ll end soon .
__label__noemo	I am returning these books .
__label__joy	I enjoy oil painting . I learned it in one of my extra classes in college .
__label__noemo	She'd say I have a lot of initiative , I see the big picture and I do what has to be done . Second , I always meet deadlines . If I say I'm going to do something , I do it . Lastly , I have the ability to focus on what I'm working on I am not easily distracted .
__label__joy	Sounds good . Thanks a lot .
__label__noemo	Hello 。 this is Susan .
__label__noemo	May I help you ?
__label__noemo	I have no idea . Could you recommend me one ?
__label__noemo	No . don ’ t bother .
__label__noemo	You see , but I do business on a commission basis . A commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales . Even two or three percent would help .
__label__noemo	Have you noticed the Mexican restaurant on the other side of this street ?
__label__noemo	I don't know why , but I think there's something wrong with my hands . I couldn't seem to be able to control it on the first ball .
__label__noemo	that sounds fantastic ! What time is it playing ?
__label__noemo	yes . It was starving and looking for something to eat when I saw it .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , What time does the next bus for Boston leave ?
__label__noemo	That doesn ’ t sound too bad . I ’ d certainly like to go diving . That ’ s one reason I wanted to go to the Caribbean .
__label__noemo	I am sorry to hear that .
__label__noemo	Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ?
__label__noemo	I hope you'll do better in the final .
__label__noemo	Hello , Mr Kowalski ?
__label__noemo	22 miles to the M25 , 33 miles on the M25 , and 3 after that . That ’ s a total of 58 miles , isn ’ t it ?
__label__noemo	Please tell him I'll call him at the office tomorrow afternoon .
__label__joy	Sure , I think that would be possible . Where is the fundraiser ?
__label__noemo	What ’ s up ?
__label__noemo	Certainly , sir . We can wait another day or two .
__label__noemo	I'm going there tomorrow .
__label__joy	You too . I hope to see you soon . Goodbye .
__label__noemo	Of course , such as the Alabama , which is a famous website .
__label__noemo	I spent a year to get my license .
__label__noemo	That's right . It's normal if you don't often take the plane . Just relax a little bit .
__label__noemo	Do you want to get a burger ?
__label__noemo	Do you have enough money ?
__label__noemo	I understand . Thank you very much !
__label__noemo	I hear many people have cars .
__label__noemo	Many !
__label__noemo	I'll be sure to do that .
__label__noemo	He looks strong.What does he do ?
__label__joy	Great .
__label__noemo	Right . The faint of heart should not apply .
__label__noemo	Do you need anything else from me ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s hard to commute a long way .
__label__noemo	Do you have any questions ?
__label__noemo	Yes , this letter can't go into the mail any later than 5 . It's about a contract .
__label__noemo	It ’ s a great pleasure to meet you , Mr . Brown . I believe you have seen our exhibits in the showroom . May I know what particular items you ’ re interested in ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me , but could you tell me if this bus goes to the National History Museum ?
__label__noemo	Oh , it's such a pain . We'd better go to a store later .
__label__joy	I'm glad to know that everyone made it out okay .
__label__noemo	No , thanks . That will be it .
__label__noemo	Well , it's a fruit with a big nut in it .
__label__noemo	They said it is centrally controlled.All the rooms are the same . They can't change it .
__label__noemo	how about tango ?
__label__noemo	No , usually they're very busy .
__label__noemo	Oh , that's great . It sounds like you're really happy with your move .
__label__noemo	I don't believe you .
__label__noemo	Could you please tell me your passport number ?
__label__noemo	No . I don't have soap .
__label__noemo	what's your favorite dish to make ?
__label__noemo	Then send them a SMS on their cell phone .
__label__noemo	Red cooked carp and rape with fresh mushrooms .
__label__noemo	I know you don ’ t want to pay for a job , but I think it ’ s time we consulted a headhunter .
__label__noemo	Hello , Jane . What do you do in your spare time ?
__label__noemo	Is that everything that I have to do ?
__label__noemo	It helps that my dad is an archaeologist .
__label__noemo	No problem at all . Could I have your full name , please ?
__label__joy	Good idea .
__label__noemo	Is there any pain now ?
__label__noemo	Let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration .
__label__noemo	So ?
__label__noemo	I believe industry is making us wealthier .
__label__noemo	Yes . Right over here .
__label__noemo	Cinct de mayo ?
__label__noemo	How many rooms does your house have ?
__label__noemo	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	Let me see . That ’ s no problem . I ’ ll see you then .
__label__noemo	I do . I don't know what to do after I retire . I'd like to work till I drop .
__label__noemo	What about next saturday .
__label__noemo	I am sorry . I only have my driving license with me .
__label__noemo	Hurry , the movie is coming back on .
__label__noemo	I'm serious .
__label__joy	Thank you , Li Mei . Come into the dining room . I'm going to cut the cake soon .
__label__noemo	Of course , where do you want me to stand ?
__label__noemo	Your throat must be swollen .
__label__noemo	Yeah ? You finally decided to wipe the slate clean ?
__label__noemo	Great ! I must warn you though , whatever happens , don ’ t let me go on a drinking binge . Trust me , it ’ s not a pretty picture !
__label__noemo	It's not even noon yet .
__label__noemo	I'd like to invite you for dinner tonight . Do you think you'll have time ?
__label__noemo	Pardon ?
__label__noemo	We can offer you a 5 % discount .
__label__joy	I do , that ’ s why you should appreciate this gift !
__label__noemo	Excuse me . How much for a two liter bottle of Coke ?
__label__noemo	Geez ! Now that I think about it , maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! Although , I have been to Las Vegas , and I didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that .
__label__noemo	You know that I care for you . I---I ’ m proud of you .
__label__joy	The dinner was really good . It knocked my socks off .
__label__noemo	I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth .
__label__sadness	I'm awfully sorry to have kept you waiting for so long .
__label__noemo	Really ? Do I have to do it ?
__label__noemo	I'd better not . Brooke hates the Backstreet Boys !
__label__noemo	How are you ?
__label__noemo	Good morning , you look very tired .
__label__noemo	Cindy , how come nearly all the prime-time TV shows are comedies ?
__label__noemo	I'm going to the United Stated to attend my daughter's commencement .
__label__noemo	So are you going to get a new swimsuit ?
__label__noemo	What's the score ?
__label__noemo	T / T , please .
__label__joy	That's great and it was your first try .
__label__noemo	Why don't you make a salad like that ?
__label__noemo	Damn Scott . You got big .
__label__noemo	What should I do now ?
__label__noemo	Those in traditional fields , such as agriculture and heavy industry . Younger people are not interested in doing those jobs and other countries have industries that can produce things much cheaper .
__label__noemo	Don't be so happy , it is just one of my tests !
__label__noemo	Bob .
__label__noemo	Nothing unusual , I ’ m afraid .
__label__noemo	Certainly . No one who evades tax can escape from their detection.They ' ll check your income through computers . You'd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible . If you fail to meet the deadline , you will be fined .
__label__noemo	What candidate did you vote for ?
__label__noemo	Good morning . I ’ m thinking about buying some new furniture for my living room . Could you help me ?
__label__noemo	William told you that his grandmother is sick , huh ? What exactly did he say ?
__label__noemo	How would you like the corn ?
__label__joy	that's what friends are for .
__label__noemo	I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils .
__label__noemo	right . You can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programmes . They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programmes .
__label__noemo	You know our boss always trying to save the last penny . We have to use up the equipment first .
__label__noemo	January 5th .
__label__noemo	Why don ’ t you run off with him ? What are you waiting for ?
__label__noemo	It says the book is on the shelf , but I didn ’ t find it there .
__label__noemo	Ten more minutes , mom .
__label__joy	Right ! Anyway , the basic difference between a digital camcorder and its traditional counterpart is that it speaks digital .
__label__noemo	Some men do , but not me .
__label__joy	Well , with the ticket , you can get a free drink . What would you like ? Orange juice ?
__label__noemo	Where is that ?
__label__noemo	The blue one ?
__label__noemo	The company introduction , our mission , vision , various policies , insurances , pension plan , company ID , batch , telephone , e-mail set-up and training .
__label__noemo	Well , I hope he starts feeling better . Say hi to him for me .
__label__noemo	A cold-wave , please .
__label__noemo	Maybe . I know I agreed to go with you , but now I don't feel right about it .
__label__noemo	I went to Croydon .
__label__noemo	Oh , I would really appreciate that . By the way will I be going North or South ?
__label__noemo	Nothing . The landlord pays .
__label__noemo	Who started the modern Olympics ?
__label__noemo	How much time do you need ?
__label__noemo	In fact my records were excellent . My overall GPA was 9 on a 10 scale , which was the highest in my class .
__label__noemo	They were grown without using any chemicals that are harmful to our health . And yes , John , we need organic carrots ...
__label__noemo	I see . I can tell Mr.Thomas that you phoned .
__label__noemo	Hello , this is the apartment manager speaking .
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . By the way , what shall I do if changes in altitude create pressure on the ears ?
__label__sadness	A couple of days ago . I just go back from the funeral .
__label__joy	Have a nice journey , Lily .
__label__noemo	What's the postage on these letters to hongkong , please ?
__label__noemo	Come on , John . This is my favorite show .
__label__noemo	What's the difference ?
__label__noemo	That short guy on her right . What's his name ?
__label__noemo	If I had chance again , I'd major in English . You're good at language .
__label__noemo	Yes . Each apartment has one .
__label__noemo	O . K . We offer a few different kinds .
__label__noemo	You're a good student . I'm sure you can do well . What you need to do is to relax .
__label__joy	Thanks a billion .
__label__noemo	It's difficult to explain .
__label__noemo	I can try to arrange that for you .
__label__noemo	Great ! I like that suggestion , but what if I need to print something there ?
__label__joy	Yes , mom . You are right . Nothing is impossible to a willing heart . I will keep going .
__label__sadness	Not so well . I've come down with the flu .
__label__noemo	Last time I tried a pin curl perm and a foam permanent . Set the wave a little looser than usual , please .
__label__noemo	That's very respectable , but I could never live with my parents . I usually only see them at our christmas celebration — and that's enough !
__label__joy	It ’ s a very quiet neighbourhood . There ’ s some traffic , but not much . It ’ s not very difficult to get to the city centre , but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ’ ll get lost . So when are you going to drop by ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , but I don't usually have time to eat a big breakfast .
__label__noemo	Can I see it for a second ?
__label__joy	Hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
__label__noemo	Yes , something called “ George W . Bush . ” An hour later , all I see are pictures of George W . Bush in women's clothes .
__label__noemo	Yes . What will you do these two days ?
__label__noemo	Sure . I'll be there as soon as I finish this document .
__label__noemo	I will call them this afternoon , thanks .
__label__noemo	Yes , I just wondered why the price between the ninth and tenth floor is so different .
__label__noemo	Oh , as simple as that ! I shall never wait for a real person again , these machines are wonderful .
__label__sadness	Yes . I have my wallet stolen .
__label__noemo	I need some stamps .
__label__noemo	Why do you want to eat western food so much today ? Anything special to celebrate ? Did you get a promotion ?
__label__joy	Sure our thing .
__label__noemo	Mr . Thomas will be here very soon . In the meantime , may I ask all of you to sign in so that I can issue your passes ?
__label__noemo	So the other party could be across the world or just on the other side of the street !
__label__joy	Don't mention it .
__label__noemo	What wrong with you ? You look pale ?
__label__noemo	The furniture cost a couple thousand dollars .
__label__noemo	Did anyone call ?
__label__noemo	Jeff , look at this listing ! It says there is a cozy studio apartment for rent , and it's only $ 700 per month . What do you think ?
__label__noemo	Yes , we have five meeting rooms , of various sizes . We can accommodate large meetings and small , informal gatherings as well . Of course , if you have many small meeting , you might consider checking
__label__noemo	Do I often have to work overtime ?
__label__noemo	What about coming back ? I'd like to come back about 7 p . m .
__label__noemo	I ’ m afraid I have some business to attend to .
__label__noemo	What style do you want ?
__label__noemo	Sure , Sherry . Sorry to have kept you waiting . If you hadn ’ t told me , I probably would have just forgotten all about them .
__label__noemo	Whatever you say .
__label__noemo	Are you an existing customer ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry , Mr . Baker is not in . May I take a message ?
__label__noemo	That was a short relationship . You only started dating 2 months ago .
__label__noemo	We have trained analyzers to do quality analysis at the end of each part when we make the product . This means that no mistakes are made .
__label__noemo	Both the pop music and the oil painting ate arts , but with different aesthetic values .
__label__noemo	Yes , sir , let me show you the table . This way please .
__label__noemo	Well . please accept our sincere apologies , I'll be glad to change it for another one if you wish .
__label__joy	My first grandchild .
__label__noemo	Well , I ’ ll have to discuss your application with my colleagues , and we ’ ll get back to you early next week .
__label__noemo	Well , can I put something in this handbag ?
__label__noemo	Yeah . You know driving is boring . TV can get me out of the fatigue of driving .
__label__noemo	Yes , please . May I get a glass of lemonade ?
__label__noemo	What's the matter , sir ? You look pale .
__label__anger	Whatever you say !
__label__noemo	I hate dealing with complaints . Was it a legitimate complaint ?
__label__noemo	Is it possible to get a beer ?
__label__joy	I am so happy for them .
__label__joy	My car is simply a daisy . It drives smoothly .
__label__noemo	Thank you , Mr . Brown . I really appreciate your assistance .
__label__noemo	Hey , Gucci . I didn't know it would be a charity show . You can see there are many collecting boxes at the entrance .
__label__joy	Let's keep in touch .
__label__noemo	How about make up ?
__label__joy	You are welcome .
__label__noemo	look at the girls in the street . They all have bunch of flowers.Is it Valentine's Day ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s hard to commute a long way .
__label__noemo	Well , yeah , but I'd be getting somebody else's problems .
__label__noemo	Arriving the 25th of September and leaving on the 28th ? Three nights ?
__label__joy	I like him . He's good for her .
__label__noemo	Yes , I was . Here ’ s their business card .
__label__noemo	Is that it ?
__label__noemo	Running a farm would be totally different to you current job .
__label__noemo	yes.They have some sort of digital receptionist.So when I called in , a machine told me to push a button for the department I wanted to be transferred to .
__label__joy	I'm glad you enjoyed the city , anyway . But please don't think too unkindly of us .
__label__noemo	I really can't say how long she'll be .
__label__noemo	It ’ s all right , though . Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A .
__label__noemo	Now , if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s open secret .
__label__noemo	No . Let's go over to the check-out stand .
__label__noemo	They name it after the place where it was first held .
__label__noemo	Why do you think you are qualified for this position ?
__label__noemo	Do I need to buy anything else ?
__label__noemo	I must be going .
__label__noemo	Yes , I was chosen as a Three Goods student many times in college .
__label__noemo	That's right . We didn't issue it to you , but technically we are buying it from you . So , we become involved .
__label__joy	I am ready I am going to get , let's start !
__label__noemo	Yes , I will .
__label__noemo	Well , the brown one is beautiful indeed , but I think the black one will suit you better .
__label__joy	Would you like me to give you a lift ?
__label__joy	Well , its theme is moving and profound , so from the academic aspect , this is its advantage to win the award .
__label__noemo	You can ’ t think of anything ?
__label__noemo	But it was not at all so fine yesterday .
__label__noemo	No we are gonna make the batter . Take some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency . Then add some vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing .
__label__noemo	They must have some special methods to do this during the process .
__label__noemo	Last night he told the children acliff-hangerstory and both of them were scared out of sleep .
__label__noemo	How long is that journey ?
__label__joy	Where is our camera ? Let's see if we can catch this on film !
__label__noemo	No , seriously . . . I really want this .
__label__joy	Grand Theft Auto Three is awesome !
__label__noemo	No , I haven ’ t hit my head .
__label__joy	So , you finally got your doctorate in genetics . Well done !
__label__joy	Yes . They ’ re coming the beginning of August .
__label__noemo	Hello , Mr . Sandals . My name is Michelle . What days do you need that reservation , sir ?
__label__noemo	Sorry , I just worried about him . You know , he should be here an hour ago .
__label__noemo	Which color do you like ?
__label__noemo	Yes . She goes three times a week .
__label__noemo	Why do I have to hire you ?
__label__joy	Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed .
__label__noemo	Is there anything I can do for you ?
__label__noemo	Ok !
__label__noemo	Excuse me , I don't feel good right now .
__label__joy	Very good . But you should talk about your family , too .
__label__joy	Can we stop here for a while ? My backpack is very heavy .
__label__noemo	We ’ re planning on having children soon , I don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
__label__noemo	What a pity . Do you have reproductions of this paint ?
__label__noemo	yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet .
__label__noemo	Betty was in hospital .
__label__noemo	No joke ! That's why she hasn't married yet .
__label__joy	I have some good news for you .
__label__noemo	Mangoes . What are they ?
__label__noemo	Maybe so , but it seems kind of strange , which the rest of us in white shirts , dark suites , and ties .
__label__joy	I've already got mine .
__label__noemo	Well , we didn't ask for this room service maybe someone else ask it , I ’ m sure .
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . Yeah . Some people like traveling , some don ’ t . My husband didn ’ t like traveling at first , either . He said what ’ s the use of traveling ? A waste of money and a waste of time.At last I got him on the move . After all , he loved me . We went to Bali , Indonesia , one of the most beautiful places in the world . That trip left a very deep impression on him . Since then whenever we have holidays and money , we ’ d like to patronize the travel agency . Isn ’ t it a bit dull to shut yourself at one place all your life ?
__label__noemo	Take a look at the ones on display , please .
__label__noemo	Could you make it up by attending my other section this week ?
__label__noemo	What was that like ?
__label__noemo	No . That is something only true Catholics do.So if you come to the church as a visitor , you only listen to the service.But you shouldn't go up to the altar for the bread and wine.Only after someone joins the church , then they go up for the Eucharist .
__label__noemo	I ’ m going to visit my brother . he ’ s just had a baby . He lives in Minneapolis .
__label__noemo	No . did you ?
__label__noemo	How are you ? How nice to see you again . How is everything going ?
__label__noemo	All the moon cakes are generally classified into two styles , Cantonese style and Suzhou style .
__label__noemo	Yes , of course . Can I make a reservation for you ?
__label__joy	That sounds great . I love Korean food .
__label__noemo	Sure . You can send E-mail to each other every day through the internet . In addition , you can make a phone call through the internet , too .
__label__joy	Sounds like you're happy with your decision .
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	yes , I think so . It doesn ’ t close until 5 o ’ clock . You still have plenty of time .
__label__anger	Bob , I'm really upset with you .
__label__joy	Ha-ha , see you then .
__label__noemo	One US Dollars in cash is equivalent t0 7.9 Yuan .
__label__noemo	That's cool . Hey , so have you decided on your major yet ?
__label__noemo	You got it .
__label__joy	Sounds good . The food there is fantastic , too .
__label__noemo	Good choice !
__label__noemo	I know what love it . When I was young , I felt the same way .
__label__noemo	I hope your stay here was satisfactory , sir .
__label__joy	Certainly , it is very nice talking with you . But I really have to go now . Catch you later .
__label__noemo	I want to go to Broadway and 82nd Street . Can I take any bus that comes along ?
__label__noemo	Project Management . I was very interested in this course when I was a student . And I think it's very useful for my present work .
__label__noemo	Mom , just ten more minutes . The show is going to be over soon .
__label__noemo	How ?
__label__disgust	I hate spending too much time at home . I get bored of it really quickly . I ’ m always excited about going out to party or other social event and meeting people .
__label__noemo	No , I haven ’ t .
__label__noemo	of course . It's be against the law if we didn't .
__label__noemo	But don't forget you are in a cafe .
__label__disgust	True ? The food is terrible .
__label__noemo	Every country should face the history .
__label__noemo	Is that your phone ?
__label__noemo	I like it here at PCC .
__label__noemo	I am quite outgoing , I think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with other people .
__label__noemo	Well , between $ 350-400 a month .
__label__noemo	Good morning . Your ticket and passport , please ?
__label__noemo	Good morning , Madam ! Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I've just come from the States , yesterday in fact . I'm still a bit confused about the time .
__label__noemo	Would you take $ 12 ?
__label__noemo	What shall I do with my two more bottles ?
__label__noemo	I'll let you know . Did you want to watch some TV ?
__label__noemo	Oh , no . I also need this tomorrow evening .
__label__noemo	920 pm , I couldn't say . I can't remember .
__label__noemo	I would love the help ! Would you prefer helping with the writing part or is programming more your thing ?
__label__noemo	No , I don't have it with me.But I know I have a reservation . My husband made it for me last month .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t know . How about you ? are you staying here or somewhere .
__label__noemo	Yes , I did . It was one of the conditions of the insurance policy . The insurance company need to assess the risk .
__label__noemo	Unfortunately , yes . It will be clear early Saturday morning but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day . There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Southeast . Folks in those areas might see some hail and flooding , especially in areas that have been experiencing record high rainfalls .
__label__noemo	Fine . Thank you .
__label__noemo	I want to make a deposit today .
__label__noemo	We ask for full payment at sight , because we guarantee 90 % mechanical efficiency for all our products . You don't have the same guarantee from other suppliers . The usual percentage is around 85 .
__label__noemo	Is there anything interesting ?
__label__noemo	No problem . We want a minimum of 1,000 dozen of men's shirts and a minimum of 3,000 dozen of embroidered shirts . Can you guarantee continuous production and adequate supply ?
__label__noemo	All right .
__label__noemo	Oh , dear , go get another pair . I'll help you change your shorts .
__label__noemo	What would you suggest ?
__label__noemo	What a nuisance ! Every time I plan to go canoeing or camping , a storm comes along . The sky gets dark , the wind starts to howl and the temperature drops.Well , I'd better stay home .
__label__noemo	The lady at the desk , Shelly I think , told me you offer many other consultancy services .
__label__noemo	All right , if there's no hold-ups .
__label__noemo	Thanks .
__label__noemo	Well , I'm afraid your father's not interested in modern films .
__label__noemo	Certainly I will , Mr . Robbins . By the way , may I use a window envelope ?
__label__joy	Good plan . What should we get for Mom though ?
__label__noemo	That's right . She is pretty , but she wants to control everything in his life .
__label__noemo	Do you want to mail it by air or sea ?
__label__noemo	What happened before ?
__label__anger	What ’ s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong .
__label__noemo	Sorry . This is a one-man job . I've got the grill just how I like it , and I've made up my own special sauce .
__label__noemo	It's on the first floor , to the right of the main entrance .
__label__noemo	Miss , where do you want to go ?
__label__noemo	Aren't there any trains before ten thirty ?
__label__joy	Thx .
__label__joy	It'll be great to have you again .
__label__noemo	He is at the warehouse this morning .
__label__noemo	Calvin , how much money did you spend last weekend ?
__label__noemo	There is a desk and two chairs .
__label__noemo	Would you like an apartment for just yourself , or do you need it for two people ?
__label__noemo	Welcome to IBA . Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Will you be voting ?
__label__surprise	Oh , but why ?
__label__surprise	Really ! How fascinating .
__label__noemo	No champion can remain at the top for ever .
__label__noemo	Hmm . I have only one best friend .
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . Will I lose any money if I decide to withdraw on it now ?
__label__noemo	These are from Mexico .
__label__noemo	I want to buy a black suit .
__label__noemo	sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ?
__label__noemo	It's a feature film .
__label__noemo	Draft beer and cans beer . Which do you prefer ?
__label__noemo	come off it , It's not that serious . You should DIY ( do it yourself ) sometime .
__label__noemo	I get paid on Friday , I'll pay you back then .
__label__noemo	I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . I need to refill this prescription .
__label__noemo	When can you get the finished product to me ?
__label__noemo	What about your computer skills ?
__label__noemo	It's like this , it's square with a leather cover .
__label__joy	I see . Thank you very much for your information .
__label__noemo	Here you are . You must return them within a month .
__label__noemo	Good evening , sir . What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , I guess you're right . I think the trust game was my favorite . I think in order to have a strong team , we've all got to learn how to trust each other more .
__label__noemo	Why do they serve up the noodles first ? I don't like it . Where is the cake ?
__label__joy	I hope you find a nice sweater .
__label__noemo	Well , this really is delicious , I have to admit . I can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining .
__label__joy	I will miss you .
__label__noemo	Clean up the mess first , then fit a new seal and check the valve .
__label__noemo	Thank you for your advice . I'll have a try .
__label__noemo	Have you got anything to declare , madam ?
__label__anger	Flight BE407 to Rome is delayed . Will passengers please wait in the lounge .
__label__noemo	Oh , I like red wood . How much do you charge for it ?
__label__noemo	You're right , doctor . It's more important to be healthy than wealthy . I'll change my job . I'm grateful for your advice .
__label__noemo	How about anything for dessert like an apple pie or ice cream ?
__label__noemo	What day is that ?
__label__noemo	Just try to be a little more punctual in the future .
__label__noemo	Oh , I see .
__label__noemo	In a word , you should keep decent manners in the interview .
__label__noemo	I see . Payment by LC is the safest method , but could you make an exception and accept DA or DP ?
__label__noemo	Did you hear about the robbery ?
__label__noemo	How do you do ?
__label__noemo	Sure , sir . How many of you are there ?
__label__noemo	What else will the Employment Development Office need ?
__label__noemo	How can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Why didn't you tell me ? I didn't know you were one of our students .
__label__noemo	No idea . Your guess is as good as mine .
__label__noemo	Certainly , Mr . Smith .
__label__noemo	I hope you have a good stereo .
__label__noemo	I really didn't see it .
__label__noemo	The position calls for a person with some working experience . We must be able to benefit from your analytical and interpersonal skills . Can you deliver your resume to us first ?
__label__noemo	I wonder how old these things are , thousands of years ?
__label__noemo	A bookstore , probably . With a yellow and orange logo .
__label__noemo	Yes , with the LUX dandruff shampoo . It helps a lot to get rid of my dandruff .
__label__noemo	Have you got small change ? They require exact fare .
__label__noemo	Let me see .
__label__noemo	Needless to say .
__label__joy	Yes , I am . I like to watch soccer games on TV , but I don ’ t play . I watched every game of the 2002 World Cup .
__label__noemo	Well , I know you are pretty busy these days . But we have got to work fast on this . Otherwise , we'll lose the market .
__label__noemo	That sounds very good . How do you see your career development ?
__label__noemo	I hate to make you work through your lunch break with how busy you are ...
__label__noemo	here we go .
__label__noemo	Yeah . He ’ s older , so he doesn ’ t slam , as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ’ s still amazing .
__label__noemo	I think I will give you a 3 months ’ trial . The salary for this period is 800 yuan a month with no bonus . After that period if we both feel satisfied , a formal contract would be signed .
__label__joy	Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ?
__label__noemo	No . But my husband smokes 20 or more a day .
__label__noemo	Repairman.May I come in ?
__label__noemo	Let's do something really nice for our family this Christmas .
__label__noemo	What's this , I wonder ?
__label__noemo	What do you mean ?
__label__noemo	You can use it however many times you need to .
__label__noemo	Oh ... I mostly just like to listen . You're the groom . Why don't you go first ?
__label__joy	I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ?
__label__noemo	So you think it's OK for people who are dieting to eat chocolate , don't you ?
__label__noemo	Have you begun cleaning up that room of yours ?
__label__noemo	You aren ’ t going to a strip club , are you ? I don ’ t want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it ’ s your friends party .
__label__noemo	ok . Just call me if you need anything then .
__label__noemo	Where did you learn it ?
__label__noemo	Hi , I ’ m Henry Wilson from number 37 .
__label__noemo	Well , the bigger the better , I think .
__label__noemo	What kind of test is this ?
__label__noemo	Everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games .
__label__noemo	Frans Smith ? I think you may have the wrong number .
__label__joy	Nice to meet you . My name ’ s Sophie .
__label__noemo	Can you mail this at the post office for me ? I have to go to the doctor for an appointment and I don't have enough time to go to the post office .
__label__noemo	Your seat is in cabin No . 5 , the upper deck . It ’ s near amid ship .
__label__noemo	Not at all . I never really did , to be honest . What about you ? Did your family used to play games together ?
__label__noemo	Can you lend me some money ?
__label__noemo	Let's step in , Dad .
__label__noemo	It doesn't matter . Follow me , please . What do you think of the table in the center of the dining room ?
__label__noemo	You never know when two might turn into three .
__label__joy	It's very considerate of you to do so . Do you have any laundry today ?
__label__joy	Enjoy yourself .
__label__noemo	Well , I hope it's comfortable enough for you .
__label__noemo	Hey Sarah , are you all right ? You look upset .
__label__noemo	Well , I believe it now , and when are they are getting marry ?
__label__noemo	I can't understand him anyway .
__label__noemo	I ’ m willing to provide my services .
__label__joy	You have a very good taste , this pair is the latest product .
__label__noemo	Is it possible to consider FOB ? That way , we will handle the insurance through our broker .
__label__noemo	I'm going to be on time today .
__label__noemo	Yes , we have several rooms available . Would you like two twin beds or one queen size bed ?
__label__noemo	Will there be any layovers ?
__label__noemo	John .
__label__noemo	Looks like dinner's ready .
__label__noemo	I told you so . I kept having problems with it yesterday . I don't know what's wrong .
__label__noemo	Not yet . Let's go to that restaurant on the corner .
__label__noemo	I don't want to do that to you , Karen .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t mention it . See you .
__label__noemo	Shall we share a taxi ?
__label__surprise	Bob is retiring , wow ... that's news to me , I had no idea Bob was that old , retirement's still sixty-five , right ?
__label__noemo	Charles ? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here ?
__label__noemo	Well , those books are really good . I like them too . How do you entertain yourself ?
__label__noemo	Let me check . Hold on , please ... Yes , that's fine . Smoking or nonsmoking area ?
__label__noemo	My doctor says I should cut back on sodium-rich foods to lower my blood pressure .
__label__joy	Oh , my god ! He ’ s so perfect .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid we have no more sole .
__label__noemo	I will talk about developing sales through our website.All the branch heads will be there , and most of the staff .
__label__noemo	All right , doctor . But it really hurts .
__label__noemo	Oh , that's so bad . I know little about that . Is there a remedy for it ?
__label__noemo	Hmm ... okay , here ’ s the thing . I ’ Ve always seen you as more than just a friend , and I can ’ t take it any more . I know you better than anyone , I know the pros and cons of your personality , I even know what side of the bed is yours ! I think we would be great together , don ’ t you ?
__label__joy	Well , let's take the measurements right now .
__label__joy	I went to Super Junior's concert last night . It was fantastic .
__label__noemo	Good afternoon , Ma ’ am , My name is Mike and I am selling subscriptions to all sorts of periodicals .
__label__noemo	Please take me to Plaza Hotel .
__label__noemo	Our engineers are on call 24 hours a day . We guarantee someone will be with you within four hours , but in practice it's often much sooner .
__label__noemo	So did I .
__label__noemo	yes . I can't seem to drink enough .
__label__surprise	My phone ?
__label__noemo	In that case , formal suit with a nice tie will be better .
__label__noemo	I wasn ’ t serious , because Obama got elected .
__label__noemo	And it's a brick ?
__label__noemo	how about your tongue ? Does it still hurt ?
__label__noemo	May I have my bill now ?
__label__noemo	Yes , Sir . For how many people , please ?
__label__noemo	how long do you think it will take us to complete the walk ?
__label__joy	You said it .

__label__noemo	I'm sorry to hear that . Please tell me the exact problem .
__label__noemo	How do you want it ?
__label__noemo	I prefer the linen one .
__label__noemo	Correct . Now for a harder question . Who will be the first men on Mars ?
__label__joy	Great ! I ’ ll just sit here and wait .
__label__noemo	One minor problem , sir . Our prices are now slightly higher . Is that acceptable , sir ?
__label__anger	Fine ! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon !
__label__noemo	The road ahead is blocked . There might have been an accident .

The agenda for this meeting is as follows , first , a presentation of the new proposal by Mr . Black . Second , an analysis by Ms . Nielson . Finally , a discussion about whether or not to implement this proposal .
__label__noemo	You shall just take it in surprise .
__label__noemo	That's right , I have to work hard .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__noemo	Really ? What's the series about ?
__label__sadness	But she means a lot to me .
__label__noemo	well , I still can ’ t adjust to the fast pace of city life .
__label__noemo	I'll have a cup of tea .
__label__noemo	I hope so . And I will definitely tell you if I can not .
__label__noemo	Yes , I see what you mean . You need to reject these documents .
__label__joy	That is so nice of you . If I like the service and the training equipment , I think I well join the club .

__label__noemo	En , I am looking for the shop . Can you tell me where it is ?
__label__noemo	I couldn't agree more .
__label__noemo	Because I got my AA and now I am going towards my bachelor degree .
__label__noemo	Lizzy smith .
__label__noemo	Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun .
__label__noemo	I see . What about the dress over there ? I would like to try it on .
__label__noemo	Where did you visit ?
__label__noemo	No , we don't .
__label__noemo	Yeah , it ’ s gonna take you a while if you go by foot . I ’ d say it's about a 30 - minute uphill walk . You have to be as strong as a lion to make it .
__label__noemo	Why , what's the problem ?
__label__noemo	Loretta ? No , she can't come , she's busy .
__label__noemo	I apologize for their tardiness .
__label__noemo	Me , too . Why don't we get ready now ?
__label__noemo	Yes , Madam .
__label__noemo	And would you like an appetizer before your meal ? The soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup .
__label__noemo	Dad , what are we doing tonight for fun ?
__label__noemo	Because I think it's boring
__label__noemo	Not really . I just worked on my car all day .
__label__joy	Yes , my friend Steve . I'll introduce you .
__label__noemo	Yes , I think so . It doesn ’ t close until 5 o ’ clock . You still have plenty of time .
__label__noemo	Well , there was one good piece of news . You remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ?
__label__noemo	Then , I'll have this pork cute instead .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll have apple pie too , but without ice cream . I have to watch my weight .
__label__noemo	We need you to send a deposit for 1/3 of the bill . You can send the check , or you can use the credit card .
__label__noemo	OK , OK , I ’ ll go .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t believe that .
__label__noemo	I ’ m hungry , let ’ s grab a bite to eat .
__label__surprise	You haven't heard about it ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to try a local beer . What would you suggest ?
__label__joy	That sounds great . I'll bring a bottle of wine then .
__label__noemo	Next Friday .
__label__noemo	When I entered the room , I forgot to close the door . Later , I couldn ’ t help smoking , you know I am a heavy-smoker . What ’ s more , I forgot to polish my shoes . There is some dirt on it .
__label__noemo	I can always borrow the book from another library .
__label__noemo	Well , it ’ s nice to have a husband like you .
__label__noemo	OK . I'll take four kiwis .
__label__noemo	Yes , a little .
__label__noemo	How much ?
__label__noemo	Didn't you even want to go to the cinema ?
__label__joy	Hooray ! I can play football with daddy . Mom and sister can play badminton .
__label__noemo	How long would you like to stay with this company ?
__label__noemo	I used to work as a teacher .
__label__noemo	Sorry.What was that you said ?
__label__noemo	What do you mean--a membership card ? I already have one .
__label__noemo	What do you think we can do about this ?
__label__noemo	Then why don ’ t we go for a walk in the hills . It ’ d be very good for us you know .
__label__noemo	I'll give him a call .
__label__noemo	Sorry , I don't .
__label__sadness	I may have done a lot , but none is to my satisfaction .
__label__noemo	Okay , sir , but don't think too long . Your checkout is only 30 minutes away .
__label__noemo	And I can choose any color ?
__label__joy	That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic .
__label__noemo	What do you mean ?
__label__noemo	And he ’ s always busy with his pictures and roses .
__label__noemo	Have you been drinking ?
__label__noemo	Www !
__label__noemo	But what about the indirect ones ?
__label__noemo	I've learnt a lot about business knowhow . I got to know what kind of knowledge was needed in my future work .
__label__noemo	Any time after 2 pm today would be good for me .
__label__noemo	Cheerfulness and friendliness .
__label__joy	How have you been ?
__label__noemo	I wonder why he is chosen to be the groomsman , and why mary doesn't marry him since he's much more attractive .
__label__joy	Do you need help setting up or anything ? I don't mind . I like to do that kind of thing . It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating .
__label__noemo	But it's so thin . There's no way that it comes with a CD-ROM .
__label__noemo	Wow , Is winter always this cold in Taiwan ?
__label__noemo	most students just cram the night forehead .
__label__noemo	Looks to me like an 18-55 mm lens . pretty standard , that will do . Not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything !
__label__noemo	I'm not getting one .
__label__sadness	I'm afraid it is . So you will have to pay two yuan extra . The total charge is four yuan .
__label__noemo	That's called blind love . Well , I gotta run . Tell me how it goes next week .
__label__noemo	Welcome to Adventure Tours . How may I help you ?
__label__noemo	You don ’ t want to eat food that is high in fat . You need to avoid caffeine and sugar .
__label__surprise	oh , why ?
__label__noemo	And how's everyone in your family ?
__label__noemo	Mr . Carmichael , this is Ellen Bower calling again . You had said I should call this week to schedule an interview with you .
__label__noemo	Good morning ! What can I do for you ?
__label__joy	OK . It's 15066688866 . Call me ! Bye-bye , then .
__label__noemo	It ’ s so sad . They had been together for only two months . Do you know what the matter was ?
__label__noemo	Where do I go to pick up my ballot ?
__label__noemo	You are really a wet blanket .
__label__anger	That just isn't good enough . Cet me your general manager . I want to speak to him now .
__label__joy	Oh , I'll try to catch it .
__label__noemo	Mom , I don't want to go to see a doctor .
__label__joy	Thanks for the warning , Mom .
__label__noemo	What size do you wear ?
__label__noemo	Here's the money , keep the changes , please .
__label__noemo	I'm tired of dancing .
__label__joy	Ah yes , that is a great refrigerator .
__label__noemo	And I came up and asked to sit by you ...
__label__noemo	I ’ m sure ... we ’ Ve got all our bases covered .
__label__noemo	Julia , I saw two men fighting beside our door this morning .
__label__noemo	yes , the scenery there is breathtaking . I have some pictures at home . You can come over and take a look if you like .
__label__noemo	Would you please fill out this currency declaration form ? It's a record of the foreign currency you have brough in .
__label__noemo	But it doesn't have a turntable . I have a fair number of vinyl records , so I need something to play them on .
__label__noemo	Yes , I've been wanting it short for a while now .
__label__noemo	Will there be anything else ?
__label__noemo	That's right . I know it must sound crazy to you , but we believe there will be fewer absences this way .
__label__noemo	I was surprised to see how few people you have on-site . You provide a wide range of goods and services but have a very small workforce .
__label__noemo	Here's the key then .
__label__noemo	I could help you with buying your books if you meet me there at 1

__label__noemo	We do think so .

__label__noemo	Do you have any vacancies ?
__label__noemo	What are you assigned to do ?
__label__noemo	Have you seen the new girl in school ?
__label__noemo	I have a court date coming up .
__label__noemo	Hello , I need to come in and see the doctor .
__label__surprise	I wasn't aware of that !
__label__noemo	No .
__label__noemo	How many people are there in your family ?
__label__noemo	I've sent my CV to dozens of companies but nobody has got back to me .
__label__noemo	Could you use wooden cases instead ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , I really want it . I am on my uppers .
__label__joy	Hi , I'm Benjamin . Nice to meet you here . You look great .
__label__noemo	Did anyone get hurt ?
__label__surprise	Milestones ? May , you must be kidding .
__label__noemo	Remember , it is in the E building on the third floor .

__label__noemo	Do you know what street it goes on ?
__label__noemo	Would you mind if I ask you whether you are married or not ?
__label__noemo	That's a thought . It's still early , and the beach isn't crowded at this time of the day . If we don't stay too long , we won't get sunburned .
__label__noemo	Either they go to a public place such as a hotel , a restaurant , or a club , or to the home of the brid
__label__noemo	indeed . Team work is highly valued in this new company . I like our boss too . He is easy to get along with treats everybody with respect and appreciation . He's highly respected by all his employees .
__label__noemo	Sure , I promise .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid you'll need to have your visa extended before we can have you check in .

__label__noemo	Can I help you , sir ?
__label__noemo	OK . OK . I don't want to haggle with you . Let's say , how about 3.5 % ?

__label__noemo	Sure . I like the writer's language , too .
__label__noemo	It doesn't matter .
__label__noemo	Yeah , but come on , Geoff , as if you don ’ t check Facebook at work . Look , you hired this guy , we ’ Ve invested a lot of time and money in his training , so now it ’ s up to you to coach him . Make it work , Geoff !

__label__noemo	I'm calling about you appointment.Mr.Smith has to cancel all his appointments because he's got something urgent to attend to .
__label__sadness	I ’ m afraid that I can ’ t . They were in fashion last year and the year before last . But they ’ re not in fashion this year . These shoes are in fashion now .

__label__noemo	I ’ m afraid we ’ re in for a rough weekend , Marry . There is a storm system moving through the East Coast . It will be drizzling all day today , and there ’ s a 60 percent chance of thunderstorms this evening . It will be warm and humid all weekend . In the Midwest , expect strong winds and a low of around 40 degrees .
__label__joy	Good idea .
__label__noemo	Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school ?
__label__noemo	What can I do for you , sir ?
__label__anger	I have been looking at this online catalog for over an hour and I still haven ’ t finished getting all the kitchen appliances that we need !
__label__noemo	Not good . I lost my wallet .
__label__noemo	Yeah , why don't you do that , and then you can give me a call sometime next week .
__label__noemo	She ’ s going to live in Paris .
__label__noemo	I don't know anything about American food . What do you recommend ?

__label__noemo	I suggest you take this book.It ' s very exciting .
__label__noemo	Nice to meet you , too . I thought I should come and say hello to you . I haven't known anybody .
__label__noemo	Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?
__label__joy	Hi Amanda , how are you ? I've missed working with you and the whole gang since my transfer last week .
__label__noemo	You give them your information by answering a questionnaire and they will create a perfect trip for you according to your budget .
__label__noemo	I think I forgot it in the car .
__label__noemo	I don't see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You'd better stop being so ridiculous .
__label__noemo	Are you serious ? You always blow things out of proportion . In any case , I think I ’ ll go take an oatmeal bath .
__label__noemo	Yes . I like gardening .
__label__noemo	Here , I'll break them up , so they're smaller . And here's some cough syrup .
__label__noemo	I'm not exactly sure .
__label__noemo	Go and try it on .
__label__noemo	How about 2 o'clock this afternoon ?
__label__noemo	Many people like him get a flying start but soon disappear .
__label__noemo	Let me give you a hand . The author is ...
__label__noemo	Drop me at the Manhattan Post Office .
__label__noemo	Let me play it for you .
__label__joy	Then we can take a walk and enjoy the scenery in the park .
__label__noemo	Yes , I did . I heard that they took both drivers to hospital . One needed surgery .
__label__noemo	Good question . I have to think about it .
__label__surprise	Are you serious ?
__label__noemo	Maybe I could get back to you in a few weeks . I am leaving on vacation this afternoon .
__label__noemo	Ladies should wear professional suits , either classical style or free style . It would be appropriate to wear a little or no make-up .
__label__noemo	I am an eloquent speaker in the classroom . But when I face a stranger outside , I get tongue-tied and nothing comes out .
__label__noemo	while seeing others going to work or continue their study , I didn't know what I would do .
__label__noemo	As a rule we don't allow any commission . But if the order is sizable one , we will consider it .
__label__joy	I love you , happy anniversary .
__label__noemo	Do you remember when and where you last saw it ?
__label__joy	Well , as far as I can see , the advantages outweigh the disadvantages . You've sold me ! I'd like to go ahead .
__label__noemo	Do you really ?
__label__sadness	Except housework , that is .
__label__noemo	What do you mean ?
__label__noemo	Yes , just tinned meat .

__label__noemo	Where did you get assigned to go this time around ?
__label__joy	Well , thank you very much , I hope I can find it .
__label__noemo	Should we call the Olsen's and ask them if they want to join us ?
__label__noemo	But very much quicker . But I know we'll never agree on this subject . You prefer the car . I prefer the train .
__label__noemo	OK , thank you .
__label__noemo	How long ago was that ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to book a ticket to Shanghai .
__label__noemo	I think all you need is just a vacation .
__label__noemo	Perhaps you left that at school .
__label__noemo	I already know all of them .
__label__noemo	Fine , madam . When will Mr . Brent be arriving , and how many nights will he be staying ?
__label__noemo	Hello . This is the Holiday Inn . Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	My name is Jennifer Smith . My phone number is 610-934-9901 .

__label__noemo	I ’ ll have a diet coke , please .
__label__noemo	Did you hear what's going on downtown today ? All the orders from the factory are staging a demonstration in the streets .

__label__noemo	My uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days .
__label__noemo	Cool camera . What are its features ?

__label__noemo	But what are you going to do with that pig ?
__label__joy	No problem , sir .
__label__noemo	A black coffee with 2 sugars would be much appreciated , thanks .
__label__noemo	Is there some way I can get into contact with him ?
__label__noemo	I have no idea . Could you recommend some to me ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I can , but not very well .
__label__noemo	Anything you like , but not too many large notes . It's useful to have smaller notes .
__label__noemo	Sure ! What exactly do you have questions about ?
__label__noemo	Do you have the five dollars I lent you yesterday ?
__label__noemo	My immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me .
__label__noemo	I never know when to shake hands and when not to . Can you tell me something about it ?
__label__noemo	were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ?
__label__joy	Sure . Bring enough films , please .
__label__noemo	Actually , could I have some milk with that ?

__label__joy	Let ’ s go check it out again !
__label__noemo	Can you manage English conversation ?
__label__noemo	Let ’ s go to the seashore on Saturday .
__label__noemo	More and more people like it now . fewer people play table tennis than before . Many people like swimming , because it is fun and keeps you fit .
__label__sadness	My dissertation . I put it somewhere last night and I can't find it now .
__label__joy	Yes , I packed it myself .
__label__noemo	Have you checked the connections on your computer ?
__label__noemo	This is right . There is no doubt in my mind .
__label__noemo	That's 35 yuan each .
__label__noemo	Of course . What do you want to move first ?
__label__noemo	Those patio tables are new , aren't they ? Would it be possible to be seated out there ?
__label__noemo	I got rid of that clunker . This is my new one .
__label__noemo	Let's start the interview with some questions . Tell me about yourself and your past experience .
__label__noemo	I'm too fat for a bikini .
__label__noemo	It's all written on the brochure price list . I believe there will be one right for you . Please hurry up because almost half of units have already gone .

__label__noemo	My shirt needs ironing . Could you please help me with that , Mary ?
__label__noemo	Don't get drunk .
__label__joy	I was really glad to hear about your award , congratulations !
__label__noemo	Well , to be fare , since he's coming all the way from Lancaster , he's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us . He must get start on his commute about six thirty , no telling what time he actually gets up .
__label__noemo	I think we can handle that . Let me confirm with my boss and touch base with you again tomorrow .
__label__noemo	$ 79 a night .
__label__noemo	Let me run through this again , the first shipment for 1500 units to be delivered in 27 days by the 31 st .
__label__noemo	They are my personal effects .
__label__fear	No , you don ’ t understand , I need this tomorrow morning ! I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife ’ s dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow ! She ’ s gonna kill me !
__label__noemo	Yes , I was talking to a party . We were disconnected .
__label__noemo	actually , the woman playing Ophelia is a past classmate of mine .
__label__noemo	I had to watch a football game instead .
__label__noemo	Thank you , manager .
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	Oh , how I wish this all wasn't happening !
__label__noemo	Fine . Where are the other guys ?
__label__noemo	So , have you seen all three The Lord of the Rings movies ?
__label__disgust	I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done .
__label__noemo	Good day to you . How can I be of service today ?
__label__noemo	what ’ s wrong with is ?
__label__noemo	Oh , dear ! I'll do whatever I can .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t know ... It ’ s still a bit pricey ... Thanks anyway .
__label__noemo	It ’ s red and black .
__label__noemo	I had a headache this morning . I didn ’ t pay attention to it . I thought probably it is because I didn ’ t sleep well . But now it is getting worse and worse . I feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very light-sensitive . Maybe it is the migrated .
__label__joy	How do you do , Mr.Black ? Very happy to see you .
__label__sadness	Sorry , sir . We have only double tables left .
__label__noemo	That's 886 .
__label__noemo	I was born in Beijing in 1965 .
__label__joy	I'd love to .
__label__joy	Good to meet you too .
__label__noemo	About half an hour ago I fell on the ground and hurt my leg . It bled a lot .
__label__noemo	Do you have an account this bank , sir ?
__label__noemo	Yes.It was just when I was walking in the park . I saw some children with a newspaper .
__label__noemo	Great . Let's talk over coffee .
__label__noemo	What about the expression goodbye ? Is that an idiom ?
__label__noemo	Here you go .
__label__noemo	Why are those people crying ?
__label__noemo	Cash . Oh , I almost forgot . I need a lid , too .
__label__noemo	English and computer skills are comparatively important to this position , especially in the starting period . What ’ s your ability in these two fields ?
__label__noemo	Here's the money , keep the change .
__label__noemo	Freeze !
__label__noemo	I agree with you . Only in this way can we ease the traffic problems .
__label__noemo	How much is it for one night ? We only need it for tonight . We're going to continue our trip in the morning .
__label__noemo	What will your major be ?
__label__noemo	Then use the xerox machine .
__label__noemo	Then it'll give me my money ?
__label__noemo	How do you know about this company ?
__label__joy	But to me it's really enjoyable .
__label__noemo	Shall I pay extra charge ?
__label__noemo	I struggle with organization and time management . Punctuality has never been a strength of mine . I find it hard to organize my time efficiently . I have actually addressed this weakness recently , by attending a workshop on efficient time management . It helped me a lot , by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently , so I think I ’ m getting better now .
__label__joy	She is always behaving herself , and she's so smart .
__label__noemo	That's true , but then you have to buy a record player .
__label__noemo	That is true . The weather is constantly changing .
__label__noemo	It must be interesting to study English .
__label__noemo	I'll make it up to you . Let me know how much it costs and I'll give you the money .
__label__joy	I can transfer my home video clips from my camcorder to my computer for editing .
__label__joy	You are welcome , Jack . Glad to be of help .
__label__noemo	Have you got a single room for Monday evening , please ?
__label__noemo	Oh , that's too bad . Was it stolen ?
__label__noemo	You , too .
__label__noemo	Well , you better make sure you pay it off .
__label__noemo	Would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ?
__label__noemo	Just did my best .
__label__noemo	That's fine.please call again later .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid so .
__label__noemo	I shall wear light make-up instead of heavy . The face powder will lighten my skin color .
__label__noemo	Sure . Can I have your passport , please ?
__label__noemo	I don ’ t often go for walks , but I either play sports outside-you know , tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book .
__label__noemo	Now , many people think that women ’ s liberation is a kind of civilization , but children are getting less love from their mother because of that . What is your opinion ?
__label__noemo	I think I need a new notebook ...
__label__noemo	Hurry ! It is time for me to steal something .
__label__anger	my boss has been breathing down my neck all day . I can't wait for the weekend !
__label__joy	Thank you . I will .
__label__noemo	Well , these things happens , I know that . You just have to stay straight with me .
__label__noemo	If I were you , I would not put crime in their doing these thing . We should encourage our children to do what they like , so long as they are not far off track .
__label__noemo	You'll be OK . It's just a little bit ...
__label__noemo	did you like them ? You could take the last one home with you .
__label__noemo	One last thing . Is it waterproof ?
__label__joy	If you like to help me do the dishes , I'll be more dreadful .
__label__noemo	I live here . I was invited by George-he's the tall guy over there . He looks a bit drunk , actually ...
__label__noemo	Office software like Windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier .
__label__anger	Hey , I worked hard on that report and I deserve the grade I got .
__label__noemo	are you ready to go the concert ?
__label__noemo	are there any other things I should pay attention to ?
__label__noemo	hey , look outside ! It's started to drizzle !
__label__noemo	Yes , I will move on to XYZ Company .
__label__noemo	Addison .
__label__noemo	Thank you , sir .
__label__noemo	I think I've got a virus on my computer . Do you know how to get rid of it ? I haven't had one before .
__label__joy	Maybe so .
__label__joy	Good for you . I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months .
__label__joy	The goods in the yard sale are really cheap . I will take it .
__label__noemo	Vancouver is the third largest city in Canada .
__label__joy	I couldn ’ t be happier to know that he ’ s our new President .
__label__noemo	Hurry up ! The smile is frozen on my face .
__label__noemo	Hello , this is Lucy from ABC Company .
__label__noemo	I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done .
__label__noemo	I think , first of all , I would ask the consignee to produce survey report on loading , if they can't produce that I would suggest them to refer the case to their shipper . Meanwhile , bad weather could be agood excuse to refuse the responsibility .
__label__noemo	Take care of yourself .
__label__noemo	What kind of personality do you think you have ?
__label__noemo	I'm planning to buy a bicycle . As you are quite a cycling enthusiast , I wish you might give me some advice .
__label__noemo	The pink one is 30 yuan , and the purple one is 35 yuan .
__label__noemo	Fine , thank you . There be five of us . The rest will be along shortly .
__label__noemo	It's a really useful piece of equipment . It's for smoothing rough edges . Here let me show you how it works . It's very simple to operate .
__label__joy	I understand . Thank you very much !
__label__joy	Great . I will prepare some clothes and food for the climbing .
__label__noemo	In my opinion , a secretary must be familiar with office routine and try to do some things by you . This is the filing cabinet and any document or file you may need . And you should file these documents in alphabetical order .
__label__joy	Try to catch this bouquet then .
__label__noemo	I am terribly sorry . You didn't come to reconfirm recently.You should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it's an international flight , any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled .
__label__noemo	Well , about an hour or so .
__label__noemo	I really like the food .
__label__noemo	Do you know what kind of vegetable you want to eat ?
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__joy	Certainly.Just a moment , sir .
__label__noemo	I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed ! Then they are sold on the black market .
__label__noemo	Good idea . My wife has a fine ear for music . I am sure she would like it .
__label__noemo	Ok . How about give me a ring , then ?
__label__noemo	No .
__label__noemo	What are you using for bait today ?
__label__noemo	I need it delivered tomorrow . Will that be possible ?
__label__noemo	Okay . I ’ ll pay the charges .
__label__noemo	it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America .
__label__noemo	Their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway .
__label__noemo	She never puts words into her mouth , she only repeats the opinions of others .
__label__noemo	OK . Now what ?
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__joy	Okay . But you have to admit that it was an exciting story , especially with that surprise ending .
__label__noemo	I thought his race would have kept him from winning .
__label__joy	Wonderful . I'd like to know why you're interested in this position at our paper .
__label__noemo	What's an ID card ?
__label__noemo	Let's run up and give him a hand .
__label__noemo	Tell him I was asking about him .
__label__joy	That is really convenient . Especially now that fuel prices are so high ! What ’ s under the hood ?
__label__anger	Oh my gosh . Damn ... screw the court , I would burn down their store .
__label__joy	Yes . I like cooking very much . I got this hobby when I was 12 years sold .
__label__noemo	What about the party ?
__label__joy	Oh , look at your table ! I'll help you clear it off .
__label__noemo	What ? Did you say you never washed clothes before ?
__label__noemo	We will have a vacation next month . Why not have a tour ?
__label__noemo	For each time you overdraft , you have to pay $ 25 .
__label__noemo	Nothing but several personal effects .
__label__anger	Mom ! ! ! Please . All my friends have had it for years .
__label__noemo	Could you come back later ? We're right in the middle of dinner .
__label__noemo	Do you want anything to make you feel better ?
__label__noemo	Don't be angry , you lose money just to avoid misfortune .
__label__noemo	Then , after you sand it , you use tack cloth to wipe off any dust or sawdust .
__label__noemo	Can you help me pick out a gift for my niece ?
__label__surprise	Unbelievable ! Parking in this city is such a nightmare !
__label__noemo	It ’ s just what I want . I think I am ready to sign .
__label__joy	I do like it . Can you come down a bit ?
__label__joy	That ’ s sounds great .
__label__noemo	Yes . But there is no half fare for children . They must pay full fare .
__label__noemo	Hello . Can I speak to Anne ?
__label__sadness	No , sir . I'm afraid not .
__label__joy	I'm waiting till our President gets out of office , and the gas prices go down .
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__noemo	Reasonable .
__label__noemo	Did you take any cold medication ?
__label__noemo	Oh , such a variety . All of them are excellent both in color and flavour . No wonder our people like China ’ s tea better than any other kind . Could you give me some idea of the prices ?
__label__noemo	It is , I'll tell you why . We'll have to call in the electrician , he's going to charge overtime now because it's already 5PM , and it will probably take him an hour a light . Plus , the halogen lights take more electricity , so your electrical cost is going to be higher as well .
__label__noemo	Yes , we have . The city is famous for its beautiful evening scenery .
__label__noemo	I know . But hard work pays off , you know .
__label__noemo	Wonderful ! I think that's a great idea How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait !
__label__noemo	There ’ s not a very high demand for that kind of job , isn ’ t there ?
__label__noemo	Water is what's best for you .
__label__noemo	You can ’ t go any lower than that ?
__label__noemo	An average ten hours or more a day according to a survey , the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that .
__label__noemo	It could be as little as 2 dollars or as much as 10 dollars more per square yard .
__label__noemo	that ’ s right .
__label__noemo	Could you please pass me the salt ?
__label__noemo	What do I do next ?
__label__noemo	Dodge Automobiles , may I help you ?
__label__noemo	Oh ! I read this before . May I have another one instead please ?
__label__noemo	It's hard to say . I mean , how can you judge what's good for them ? Maybe it is best to tell them the truth no matter what it is .
__label__noemo	How many credits are you taking this semester ?
__label__noemo	Why did you quit your last job ?
__label__noemo	Thanks so much , bye .
__label__joy	I would like to purchase it .
__label__noemo	Hi , Carlos . What are you doing this afternoon ?
__label__joy	Well , that explains it . I've been using my old PIN number ! Thanks for explaining everything to me .
__label__sadness	That's terrible .
__label__joy	Oh , Uncle Giovanni . That's wonderful ! Thank you ! Thank you !
__label__joy	Not at all . It's no problem .
__label__noemo	How can you be so sure ?
__label__noemo	Well . I shouldn ’ t have any trouble recognizing him . What time does his flight arrive ?
__label__noemo	Should I just stand naturally ?
__label__noemo	Sorry , what was your last name again ?
__label__noemo	Yes , sometimes I can hardly get asleep at night .
__label__noemo	Really ? Why ?
__label__noemo	Yes . Our guest team is really tough .
__label__noemo	Is IKEA affordable ?
__label__joy	I'm all set . Thank you for the dinner , Jack .
__label__noemo	What else will they ask me ?
__label__noemo	It will begin at three o'cock . What's the time now ?
__label__noemo	Is everything to your satisfaction ?
__label__joy	OK . Bottoms up .
__label__noemo	How about 10 percent ? That's about 6 dollars .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , where am I on this map ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me . My name is Dan Ford . I have an appointment with the dentist at 3:30 .
__label__joy	Sorry . What can I say ? Now , do you want the note or what ?
__label__noemo	That's a long time . Where did she live before that ?
__label__joy	Sure . I have all kinds of tools . Just ask . I ’ ll be happy to get them for you .
__label__noemo	There won't be many other expenses expect food .
__label__noemo	Yes . I tried skiing on grass before . Not very good at it , though .
__label__noemo	I just got fired .
__label__noemo	Please have them wrapped . I'll take them away .
__label__noemo	Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better .
__label__noemo	Can I test it out ?
__label__noemo	Six nights .
__label__noemo	Seeing as next month is our slow season , that should not be a problem .
__label__noemo	Yes . I would like a ticket to Pakistan on CA .
__label__noemo	How's this one ?
__label__noemo	Is there any other way I can reach him ?
__label__noemo	Are you here for the position advertised in China Daily ?
__label__noemo	It is allowed to carry 55 pounds for each passenger .
__label__noemo	You mean the man wearing jeans ? He ’ s her little brother .
__label__noemo	Are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short voice ?
__label__noemo	What time should I come ?
__label__noemo	why is that ?
__label__noemo	I wish I could , but I'm busy . I'm going to work at a soup kitchen tonight .
__label__noemo	Banana of course .
__label__joy	Wow , you're really informative . Thanks a lot .
__label__noemo	Actually , yes I do . I was wondering about the subscription fee . And how much will you charge me during the time of redeeming this new fund ?
__label__joy	That's wonderful . Thank you .
__label__noemo	Do I have a choice ? Uh . That's a no . What can I do ?
__label__noemo	Ok . I'll keep my promise .
__label__noemo	It's true . He is a hard worker .
__label__joy	You're right . And I also meet many new friends while collecting stamps .
__label__noemo	Yes , sir ?
__label__noemo	No , that stuff isn't important to me .
__label__noemo	sure I am . I've been writing a blog for almost three years .
__label__noemo	Yes , I've already done that , and they said they'd look for it . But we're leaving soon and I need my visa and identity cards badly .
__label__noemo	When do you have in mind ?
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__noemo	Good morning , Mr . Zhang , this is Jimmy calling from Polaroid Company .
__label__noemo	What kind of references do you need ?
__label__anger	It smells like an ashtray in here !
__label__noemo	These are French coats , sir.They are quite fashionable these days .
__label__noemo	Um , Tracy ? I think that ' s a little too formal . I know you want to be polite but you've already made contact with them , so in English you can be more relaxed in the opening ...
__label__noemo	Well , I love hip hop dancing , so I should probably dance . Do you know how to rap ?
__label__noemo	Well , that ’ s the problem . We never seem to have ' typical ' days , but you'd spend about 30 % of your time on the computer . There would also be a lot of telephone time , setting up appointment , and taking care of a lot of support work .
__label__noemo	We try to get everyone in the upper management team a nice office .
__label__noemo	No regrets ?
__label__noemo	Keep it . I'm buying tonight .
__label__noemo	All the necessary documents and the information relevant to the meeting should be available , preferably printed and distributed before the meeting .
__label__noemo	I was thinking of around 10,000 RIB .
__label__noemo	What are we going to do now ?
__label__noemo	Then , I ’ d like some eggs and bread for breakfast instead .
__label__noemo	How long did you have in mind ?
__label__noemo	25 cents a day .
__label__noemo	Poor boy ! But don't worry . Here are two pills made in Germany . It's really effective . He will be just fine .
__label__noemo	Yes , Mr . Li .
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	How does Friday sound ?
__label__joy	Thanks for the compliment .
__label__noemo	How about tomorrow afternoon ?
__label__noemo	( Get here ) Here we are , sir .
__label__joy	Cool ! That's a great idea . What did you have in mind ?
__label__sadness	Let me see ... I'm sorry , but we don't have any more non-smoking rooms.We won't charge you for your room tonight .
__label__noemo	She's pretty easy to get along with . She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally .
__label__noemo	yes , everyone on the sales floor has to wear one . They're supposed to make us look more professional .
__label__noemo	Are you sure there are no more open classes ?
__label__noemo	Here you go , Miss .
__label__noemo	What would you like ?
__label__noemo	I was so scared when I saw the gun .
__label__noemo	Mmm . OK . Well , why don ’ t you tell me a little bit more about what you would like ? We have everything from mountain biking , to rock climbing to street luge .
__label__noemo	An ordinary return , please .
__label__noemo	We're interested in your Drawn Works . What about the supply position ?
__label__noemo	OK . I gotta call mine too .
__label__noemo	Does it include bonuses ?
__label__noemo	For here or to go ?
__label__noemo	OK . Let me send a memo around .
__label__noemo	My fish has good seasoning but is a little dry .
__label__surprise	Can you believe that Susan got married ?
__label__noemo	Have you watched any of the talent shows on TV ?
__label__noemo	I'm going to manage the whole accounts department .
__label__noemo	Well , I need to change the shoes I bought from Nasi . They are too small . I want to ask them whether they come in a larger size .
__label__noemo	How ’ s your father ?
__label__joy	I really like Caesar salads .
__label__noemo	How much are these in all ?
__label__joy	Don't mention it . It's my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ?
__label__noemo	Autumn is also very nice In Washington .
__label__noemo	So there are only five working days in a week ?
__label__noemo	Look , Bob . This is a photograph I took during my trip to Australia .
__label__joy	You too .
__label__noemo	He loves that blonde girl .
__label__noemo	It should have been , but it wasn ’ t .
__label__joy	Thank you , Steven . You are really a good friend .
__label__noemo	But I can't skate well .
__label__noemo	I ’ m very shy . I think I might shake in my boots at the moment I meet the interviewer .
__label__noemo	Clear soup , please .
__label__noemo	Yeah .
__label__noemo	But I said thursday.The tickets are for thursday evening .
__label__noemo	Shall we make it 250 dollars ?
__label__noemo	Thank you . By the way , is there any preferential rate for the party ?
__label__noemo	But there're no beds available now . Two patients will be discharged this afternoon , so you'll have to wait until then .
__label__noemo	All right .
__label__noemo	First of all , we'll tailor a work-out plan according to your physical conditions and your personal needs .
__label__noemo	Think , in some way it is an act of God , but in another way , it just is caused by us .
__label__joy	I'll go in time , thank you .
__label__noemo	Give me a dozen lemons .
__label__noemo	It's a pretty short trip .
__label__noemo	Yes , he is .
__label__noemo	There's a parking structure for students .
__label__noemo	Did you call me ?
__label__noemo	Because I come hiking every week . That's why I'm in good-shape . I think that I should bring you a walkingstick next time .
__label__surprise	Really ? It was on in 1994 for the first time . And it is really a classic .
__label__noemo	I will be prepared to do my presentation .
__label__noemo	Do you need any help ?
__label__noemo	What about the Yen ?
__label__noemo	Sir , when I deleted the $ 10 , the program automatically added a $ 2 service charge .
__label__noemo	Would you please show me that mural ?
__label__noemo	You're right . One minute it's hot , and then the next minute it's cold .
__label__noemo	What's more , some scenes were good , much fit for the children .
__label__noemo	She was hit by a car . Luckily , she wasn't seriously hurt .
__label__noemo	Come in and have some coffee , Anna . The kids have just gone out to the mall to hang out with their friends .
__label__joy	What are you thinking of doing ?
__label__noemo	You can have a bird view of Chilin City from the top of the mountain .
__label__noemo	Yeah . I remember it very clearly . The pain makes it easy to remember . I know you're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups .
__label__sadness	What a pity ! I should have come earlier .
__label__noemo	It was my pleasure . How about this evening ? I feel very hungry now .
__label__noemo	How much does it cost ?
__label__noemo	Good morning . May I help you ?
__label__joy	I really like you .
__label__noemo	Stop burping .
__label__noemo	That ’ s right , although we do expect you to do a little overtime if there ’ s something important to do . The lunch break is flexible . You can go a little earlier or a little later if you prefer .
__label__joy	that'd be great . I'll see you then !
__label__noemo	Right .
__label__noemo	There's obviously a problem with your connection .
__label__noemo	You have 16 balls on the table , 7 solid colored , 7 striped colored , a black 8 ball , and the white ball .
__label__noemo	I came here only a month ago .
__label__noemo	Tomorrow is my day off . I wonder if it's convenient to change our appointment from tomorrow to next Wednesday , still at the same time .
__label__joy	Yes , I have them with me . Do you want to look at them ?
__label__noemo	He lost his wallet and keys .
__label__noemo	So you said you and Amanda met through a mutual friend . How did it happen ?
__label__joy	That sounds good .
__label__noemo	I think most people do . I like wearing nice , colorful clothes in summer , you know , a nice dress or skirt . It ’ s too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter .
__label__noemo	I beg your pardon ?
__label__noemo	I have passed the CET - 4 and 6.As far as computer is concerned I can use the computer for word processing .
__label__noemo	The bridegroom looks a bit nervous .
__label__sadness	I see . Oh , wait . Ma'am , I'm sorry . These slacks were on sale .
__label__noemo	Is there a doctor here ?
__label__noemo	Oh , really ? That's nice .
__label__noemo	Maybe now I'll get that promotion I was hoping for .
__label__noemo	What ’ s the rate for a standard room ?
__label__noemo	When would you like to move in ?
__label__noemo	That's pretty bad .
__label__noemo	Good morning , Mr . Smith .
__label__noemo	It seems that you don't like him .
__label__noemo	No . But I ’ m working on it .
__label__noemo	That's fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ?
__label__noemo	It's my pleasure . We have single rooms , double rooms , suites and luxury suites , ect . Well , here is an introduction to our hotel .
__label__noemo	Need a gift for your girlfriend or wife ...
__label__noemo	Ah , some products are successful at home , but not be popular overseas .
__label__noemo	How tall would you say that she is ?
__label__noemo	I took the wrong bus .
__label__joy	Actually . I prefer we eat at home.We ' ll have more time to catch up that way .
__label__joy	I am glad you can study something you really like !
__label__noemo	Well , I agree with you . I'd rather think that the butterflies are flying around in the mountains . I just wonder if they really catch so many that it affects the butterfly population .
__label__noemo	Great . Do you think we need a Chinese dictionary ?
__label__noemo	Right . Thanks .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry to hear that . We value all of our customers , regardless of circumstances . What can we do to help ?
__label__surprise	The price tag says $ 99.99 .
__label__joy	I still like the olive one best . There's a tailor here who can take up the sleeves for you .
__label__noemo	Then I'll see you in the afternoon .
__label__noemo	That'll be all .
__label__noemo	But I didn't see the sign , Ma ’ am .
__label__noemo	What about ?
__label__noemo	High hells , please . I want to wear them in formal situations .
__label__noemo	You can see the stars so much more clearly after it rains .
__label__noemo	What's the special here ?
__label__noemo	Yes , we have many kinds of pies and puddings .
__label__noemo	Please look at the sky.Don ' t you see the dark clouds ? It's going to rain soon .
__label__noemo	No , I'm fine . I don't need to see a doctor .
__label__noemo	That ’ s exactly what I ’ m getting at . We ’ re supposed to be able to do our preparation and marking in that office , but have you noticed ? Jack constantly has students coming in to get help with his course . A lot people are going in and out .
__label__noemo	Even if they break down , they're still works of art .
__label__noemo	I thought he was maybe gay , but I wasn't sure.Anyhow , you don't expect me to go into a gay bar , do you ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I also have a Loan Certificate .
__label__noemo	Well , I don't think I can manage with it .
__label__noemo	Yes , it does . Just like a needle prick . Besides , the place that hurts often feels cold , too .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry .
__label__noemo	I am so bored all day .
__label__joy	May I ?
__label__noemo	How about the umbrella ? It's made of wood and paper . It's very beautiful .
__label__noemo	Well , I play sports indoors quite often . If I ’ m feeling lazy , I just watch a film at home . I prefer summer to winter .
__label__noemo	Tonight ? I'm afraid I can't . I've promised Mark to go to the gym . Can we make it tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	Well , Jim . It is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals .
__label__noemo	That would be nice . Can you read the characters ?
__label__noemo	I don ’ t like the pointed toes . Let me take a look at what else you have . Too high . That one looks like the back would cut into my heel . I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly .
__label__noemo	It makes sense , right ? Who else is going to eat it ?
__label__noemo	You finished everything in there , sir ?
__label__noemo	so what did you do ?
__label__noemo	Three dollars and forty cents .
__label__noemo	Well , this doesn't look too serious . Nurse , could you please get me a suture set ?
__label__noemo	Hi , is that Li Ling ?
__label__noemo	I think so , too . What do you think about that I write a letter of inquiry to the company ?
__label__noemo	Then I might as well have it done now .
__label__noemo	Why not ?
__label__noemo	I'll pass on the soup , but I'd like a garden salad .
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve worked in the field for more than 4 years . Depend on my work qualifications and experience , I would like to have 5000 Yuan to start .
__label__noemo	It ’ s 7 p . m . today .
__label__noemo	Come on . She's like that with everyone .
__label__noemo	Sorry I couldn't help you .
__label__noemo	Well , the letter is going to a friend of mine in America and it's quite urgent . It really needs to be posted today , so here you are .
__label__noemo	The soft sleeper costs 600RMB one way and the hard sleeper is 400RMB one way .
__label__noemo	It's all yours .
__label__noemo	Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities .
__label__noemo	You mean a murder cycle ? Did you know more cyclists die in accidents than motorists ?
__label__noemo	No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ?
__label__noemo	Are you ? What are you busy with ?
__label__noemo	tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	Yes , there is . Those organizations exist . You always can call a lawyer if you need legal help .
__label__joy	Good luck with school .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Look . It's begin .
__label__noemo	Actually , Costa Rica isn't in South America . It's in Central America .
__label__joy	I really love this kind of atmosphere .
__label__noemo	That's right .
__label__noemo	Yeah , you are right , but it's really interesting .
__label__noemo	Sure . What do you want to find ?
__label__noemo	It's nice to meet you , Mr . Cooper .
__label__noemo	You guessed it . She says we have to get married on January 2nd , or we'll have bad luck .
__label__noemo	Several things , for example , Various coins , stamps , stones and so on .
__label__noemo	Are you sure you heard right ?
__label__noemo	Right.It ' s important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well .
__label__noemo	We need to get it fixed soon .
__label__noemo	The pain is killing me .
__label__joy	Tell you what , I'll be calling Jim late this week anyway , so I'll mention it to him then .
__label__noemo	I've looked for , but I didn't see any black ink .
__label__joy	Thank you very much . We always welcome new customers .
__label__noemo	Of course . It's just at 19 Lingual Road . You can phone me again if you cann't find the right place .
__label__noemo	I have a B . A . in Economics .
__label__noemo	Yes , you can . That color is very popular with Honda buyers . So we've kept it available .
__label__noemo	Thank you . And here's your receipt , sir .
__label__noemo	Well , my sister is a lawyer .
__label__noemo	Trust me , regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
__label__noemo	Do we have enough time ?
__label__joy	That suits me fine .
__label__noemo	OK , do you want it urgently ?
__label__joy	Guess !
__label__noemo	I noticed there ’ s a jam a few blocks away .
__label__joy	Don't worry about that . Your English seems very good.And our instruction manuals are very clearly written . It's easy !
__label__anger	Oh , SHUT UP !
__label__noemo	Yes , but I don't really use it often . Have you ever used it ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry , Ms . Gray . I must have lost track of the time . I ’ ll get back to work , now .
__label__joy	I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it !
__label__noemo	How much will my unemployment check be ?
__label__noemo	Did someone meet you at the airport here ?
__label__noemo	Some customers demand that 80 % of the credit amount be paid at sight , and the rest be paid after the machines are proved satisfactory on trial .
__label__noemo	Well , who is your favorite football player ?
__label__noemo	Thanks . Now fill this out .
__label__surprise	Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ?
__label__noemo	If you are accepted at both places , which company will you choose ?
__label__noemo	It is not an easy job . The government is working on it . Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . Also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . But of course , it will not work overnight . So , have you come out with a new plan for today ?
__label__noemo	Well , we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans . The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period .
__label__noemo	May I have your name , please ?
__label__noemo	I want to make a phone call . Can you show me how ?
__label__noemo	Would you like to make an appointment ?
__label__noemo	What have you learned ?
__label__noemo	I'll take a dozen .
__label__noemo	Are you OK ?
__label__noemo	oh , I think they're provided by the school for that special day .
__label__noemo	Yes , bring me a bottle of wine and filet steak .
__label__joy	Nice to meet you too .
__label__noemo	that's quite a bit . If I give you a raise , I'm going to have to give everyone a raise .
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	I am not !
__label__noemo	I agree . That ’ s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine , or Wisconsin .
__label__noemo	Are the reports favorable ?
__label__noemo	No , thank you . I'll take an aspirin and see how it goes .
__label__noemo	What time do you expect him back ?
__label__noemo	That's fine .
__label__noemo	What school do you go to ?
__label__anger	Get out of it ! It wasn't as good as you think .
__label__noemo	It's a furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus .
__label__noemo	500 in twenty dollar bills and the rest in a dollar bills .
__label__anger	Easy ? Ha ! ! It was easy for them to cheat you ! !
__label__anger	Thanks ! We love it .
__label__noemo	We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .
__label__joy	The sea water treatments are supposed to be really good for you .
__label__noemo	That sounds good . At the moment I spend ages queuing at the post office to pay my bills .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__noemo	Well , I doubt that .
__label__noemo	Like to come over to our fancy dress party ?
__label__noemo	My name is David White .
__label__noemo	So when's the next forty-four ? Will it be here soon ?
__label__noemo	It's in the middle of the parking lot .
__label__noemo	Ok , i will get one for your.Here you are .
__label__anger	What ’ s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for .
__label__surprise	Morning , Bob . Fancy meeting you here !
__label__noemo	Yes , but we have life jackets . And we got a real kick out of that .
__label__noemo	Can you believe the headlines ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m going to check out tomorrow . Then we ’ ll be back in a week ’ s time . Can I leave my luggage here .
__label__joy	You ’ re right .
__label__noemo	About 2 % in normal operations .
__label__noemo	I ordered a ham sandwich , but they gave me a bologna sandwich instead .
__label__noemo	My country is well know for being very flat . There are some hills in the southeast of the country .
__label__anger	Oh , shut up , Roy .
__label__noemo	What do you mean by that ?
__label__noemo	Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic .
__label__noemo	In cash .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t know .
__label__noemo	I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
__label__noemo	No , all flights are direct .
__label__noemo	I'm terribly sorry , Rose.But I have to finish this paper by tomorrow or professor Martin will kill me .
__label__noemo	I think you've got a flu.Take this prescription to the chemist's and then go back and sleep .
__label__noemo	Sure . At what time ?
__label__surprise	Why ?
__label__joy	Let's go . We'd better buy the tickets earlier and have dinner in restaurant .
__label__noemo	Hi , Mr . James , what ’ s the rush ?
__label__noemo	Welcome to Youth Travel Agency . Is there anything I can do for you ?
__label__joy	How about seeing a play ? I hear Hamlet is on at the National Theater .
__label__noemo	Yes , it is . Are you looking for housing for this semester ?
__label__noemo	My watch says half past five .
__label__noemo	Yes . Your ticket is valid for three days .
__label__noemo	Here are your baggage claim stubs , miss . And here are your boarding passes . Your seats are 29K and 29J . Your flight leaves at Gate 7 , and we'll be boarding in about an hour and a half .
__label__noemo	I'm glad I brought my jacket on this trip .
__label__noemo	You know I could go shopping with you sometime if you need it , but can we talk about other basics ?
__label__noemo	Good Morning , I have a bad cough , and I want to see an internist .
__label__joy	Yes , that would be fine . Just make sure that everything is returned by Sunday night .
__label__noemo	I got it . Do you pay for the programs ?
__label__noemo	I was thinking about it , but I'm never able to keep my New Year's resolution . Last year for example I joined a gym and only went twice .
__label__noemo	I'm Bob Brown . But I can't recall my account number .
__label__noemo	The weather is often quite different from the weather forecast .
__label__noemo	Excuse me.When ' s the next bus ?
__label__noemo	What dress size do you wear ?
__label__noemo	Hello , Mary . What ’ s the matter with you ? You look upset .
__label__noemo	Okay .
__label__noemo	What should I prepare for the recruitment fair ?
__label__joy	Oh , it's fantastic .
__label__noemo	And she was in a movie once again , right ?
__label__anger	I don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ’ re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored .
__label__noemo	How do you feel about that ?
__label__noemo	Sir , your bags are 30 pounds over weight . You are allowed only 45 pounds of baggage .
__label__joy	This seems to be my size .
__label__noemo	Let's enter it !
__label__noemo	I've typed the report .
__label__joy	OK . Wait a minute , please . And the sugar is right over there .
__label__joy	You can use some time off.You ' Ve been working too hard anyway .
__label__joy	Can we have dinner together sometime this weekend ?
__label__noemo	Well , let's try a size ten . ( He gets another pair and the customer tries a shoe on . ) Looks like a perfect fit .
__label__noemo	You could try using a spam filter to reject stuff that's obviously pornographic or anything else you don't want .
__label__noemo	Let me pay for it . Where can I get a subway map ?
__label__noemo	Yes , well done . That's the way to go . How clever you are ! You've got it .
__label__noemo	My name is Jenny Clinton .
__label__noemo	Do you know how short you want your hair to be ?
__label__noemo	Certainly .
__label__noemo	The Computer Center is on the first floor of the library .
__label__noemo	What's the expiration date on your card ?
__label__surprise	800 books ? I'm impressed !
__label__noemo	Is this your umbrella , miss ?
__label__noemo	So how long does it take ?
__label__noemo	Around 6 o'clock .
__label__noemo	We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , sir . Can you tell me where I can buy some chocolates ?
__label__joy	That's good . I will take it .
__label__joy	Let's go see pandas ! The news said that two pandas arrived at the zoo last week .
__label__noemo	yes , they are . That ’ s very important to us . We like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . Each room has large windows .
__label__noemo	No , thank you . I've given up , you know .
__label__noemo	Yes , I did . Have you lived here long ?
__label__noemo	No , I'm not sure . I think about 65 mph , right ?
__label__noemo	Good , you are welcome .
__label__noemo	My stomach was upset .
__label__noemo	Rita . Nice to meet you .
__label__noemo	I like the plot . It's so full of twists and turns . I also like the main character . She is so humorous and smart .
__label__noemo	What do you mean ?
__label__noemo	What's your favorite sport ?
__label__joy	You are a big fan of him ! He has strong legs .
__label__noemo	this path leads to the cave . Can we look inside the cave ?
__label__joy	You bet . The wrestlers had got sound defences and they simply couldn't make it .
__label__noemo	Which function do you use more , making calls or sending short messages ?
__label__joy	Yes , I am expecting to get the bonus . I hope we will both get the salary and bonus .
__label__noemo	Well , you have to take the bad with the good .
__label__noemo	Speaking .
__label__noemo	What kind of car do you want ?
__label__noemo	Can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a little ?
__label__noemo	But , we just finished eating lunch .
__label__noemo	If we were in the same conference room , I would not work late these days . That conference room has been booked out . This time our boss wants to hold the meeting in our company . So everything has to be rearranged and checked , like tables , chairs , mean tacks , podium , audio and visual equipments and even the lunch menu .
__label__joy	Are you satisfied with the dishes ?
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome .
__label__noemo	All right . See you then .
__label__noemo	Can I ask what the position pays ?
__label__noemo	Now have a look , please . Is it all right ?
__label__noemo	Wait a minute ! Just hold your horses ! What's your hurry , anyway ?
__label__noemo	I believe so .
__label__noemo	There are a couple of reasons why you didn't pass .
__label__noemo	can you train a rabbit to do things ?
__label__joy	A teriyaki bowl sounds nice .
__label__joy	Why not ?
__label__noemo	Ok , we'll wait a while .
__label__noemo	Let me stop my car for check . Oh , my god . I got a flat tyre .
__label__noemo	Oh , no . This is going in the opposite direction .
__label__noemo	How can you tell the difference ? From what I see , they look almost the same .
__label__noemo	Is this your brother-in-law ?
__label__noemo	Thank you very much . I ’ Ve tried to keep it short and clear . If there ’ s any questions please feel free to ask me .
__label__noemo	She's about 5 feet even .
__label__joy	This website offers very convenient air tickets booking service . It is quick and accurate .
__label__noemo	No problem , sir . There's a copy machine in our computer lab .
__label__noemo	Christmas Day is coming . I want to buy several postcards to send to my family and friends . Can you recommend me some ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I ’ m sorry to hear that .
__label__noemo	Of course not . My school record was above average in my class .
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place .
__label__noemo	I can't bear eating less .
__label__noemo	Thanks , I will .
__label__noemo	I would like to have a dishwasher and central air conditioning .
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry , but that ’ s our policy .
__label__noemo	But , my overwork has not done yet . And it is driving me crazy .
__label__surprise	Are you on the level ? You're the one who called me , remember ?
__label__noemo	Not bad at all .
__label__noemo	A 10,000 dollar policy shouldn ’ t be too expensive . Here , call my agent . He will give you a good deal .
__label__noemo	How would you like your coffee ?
__label__noemo	Come on , you can at least try a little , besides your cigarette .
__label__noemo	I'm looking for a pair of shoes .
__label__joy	You won't need it . Stanley , my best man , is going to treat everybody !
__label__noemo	You don't like the performance , do you ?
__label__noemo	I should say , it stunned me . I can't imagine what they will think of next .
__label__noemo	well , if it's not broken , then you need to learn how to vacuum better , because it doesn't look like you've vacuumed for ages !
__label__noemo	She had a very impressive resume , but she seemed to lack the confidence that I think a good manager needs .
__label__noemo	what do you consider your weakness ?
__label__noemo	Tell me something about your Valentine's Day .
__label__noemo	Goodbye , Lucy .
__label__noemo	Keep in touch then , OK ?
__label__noemo	Just make sure to tell me beforehand .
__label__noemo	They don ’ t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
__label__noemo	Until when ?
__label__noemo	Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ’ m sorry I missed it .
__label__joy	OK . Let's make it .
__label__noemo	I'm not finding the work as challenging as I used to . I want to find a job that is stimulating , where I can grow .
__label__noemo	Yes , I find jogging does good to me , so I keep on doing it .
__label__noemo	Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .
__label__sadness	I ’ m sorry , Janet . I left it at home . I ’ ll bring it back in the morning .
__label__noemo	Mom , I just finished my paper . Can you proofread it before I hand it in ?
__label__noemo	She does , doesn ’ t she ! I read she ’ s twenty-nine , but she must be at least forty .
__label__noemo	I must apologize . I ’ ll buy you a new one tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Please come in for a cup of coffee .
__label__noemo	What does he do when it rains ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I was awarded a scholarship from the university every year . In 1995 I participated in the National Contest of Maths Models and I won the prize .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry . I know you feel betrayed .
__label__noemo	Not always , she's rather busy at the end of the year .
__label__noemo	I want to have Mexican food for dinner .
__label__joy	I am very happy to hear that , Karen.It ' s good to know I'm working in such a company .
__label__joy	Congratulations . But have you heard the proverb that if one gets married too hurriedly one may regret it for a long time ?
__label__noemo	Thank you ! Remember that they go to the vet this Saturday .
__label__noemo	Certainly . Does she have your number ?
__label__noemo	So , you ’ ll be at my birthday party on Friday ?
__label__noemo	I have to use the ATM .
__label__surprise	Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time .
__label__noemo	Let me see here ... yes , there's one left .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid I haven't got a larger dress . This is the largest dress in the shop .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t mention it .
__label__noemo	Let me know how it works .
__label__noemo	Laura .
__label__noemo	Your ID card , please .
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__joy	Great . Thank you .
__label__noemo	By ordinary air mail , please .
__label__noemo	What is the temperature today , do you know ?
__label__noemo	That's right .
__label__noemo	Is there anywhere I can reach him ?
__label__noemo	Two yuan , please .
__label__noemo	That ’ s a good deal . Since this is a working trip , I wonder if you have meeting rooms where I can get together with some clients .
__label__noemo	I'm going to PCC .
__label__noemo	Would you like to order anything else ?
__label__noemo	if you study hard , I don't see why you wouldn't . Have you received any other offers ?
__label__noemo	Let's go to aisle 4 to pick up some pasta for tonight .
__label__noemo	We'll be making the decision by the end of this week and we'll contact you as soon as possible .
__label__noemo	Well , I've just arrived in my room , but there are no instructions in English about the facilities available ! Could you help me for a moment ?
__label__noemo	No.The time we have spent apart has been good for us.Absence makes the heart grow fonder .
__label__joy	That's so convenient .
__label__noemo	Yes , as a representative of IBM . I hope to conclude some business with you .
__label__noemo	How would your coworkers evaluate you ?
__label__noemo	Betty , would you please read this letter of application I've just written ? I'd like to have your opinion .
__label__noemo	It ’ s such a large firm . Do we have our own staff restaurant ?
__label__joy	I will sometime . Thanks for the advice .
__label__noemo	Yes , and if I stay with you , we will have to walk back home to New York.Because we will lose all our money and our plane tickets too !
__label__noemo	I really hope it rains today .
__label__noemo	Yes , I want to know about the Normandy Landing .
__label__anger	Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me !
__label__joy	Yes , I haven't seen you for four years.How time flies !
__label__joy	Really ? You've done a good job .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t use office phones for personal matters .
__label__noemo	Mrs . Phoebe , here are your ordered goods . Please inspect the goods now .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot . I ’ Ve got one more question .
__label__noemo	Look , the reason I came into your store is because I was spending the day with Annabell and matt . And I was buying them presents . I ’ m the type of guy who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are his relative . And there ’ s only one place to find a children ’ s book in the neighborhood . That will not always be the case . And it was yours . And it is a charming little bookstore . You probably sell what 350,000 worth of books in a year .
__label__noemo	Will the electricity and water be on , or do we need to do something to get it turned on ?
__label__noemo	Oh ? What ’ s wrong ?
__label__sadness	Very sorry that I have caused you so much trouble .
__label__noemo	Sure . I was fond of those lovely children
__label__noemo	What are you looking for in your next job ?
__label__noemo	Well , today is Monday.Actually , for me Monday at this time would be the best . I am free from now until 11
__label__noemo	Sir , one copy is ten cents .
__label__joy	I ’ m ready and willing to help .
__label__noemo	I'll charge it . Here's my card .
__label__noemo	When will it be available ?
__label__noemo	That's definitely true . I'm going to have to give you a ticket . Please remember to drive more carefully next time .
__label__noemo	Ok then , your room is 502 on the fifth floor . Breakfast is served between 6.30 am and 9am . Enjoy your stay .
__label__noemo	My watch says ten past .
__label__noemo	Thanks a lot . Good-bye .
__label__noemo	Hello , Sir . You're here to discuss the Network Settlement Service , right ?
__label__noemo	I tried to work something out , but I really do have to miss one class .
__label__noemo	Absolutely . Thanks for coming Rebecca . Goodbye .
__label__joy	That's very kind of you .
__label__noemo	Hi , Steven ! What do you like to do during the weekend ?
__label__noemo	Mr . Chen himself has become an authority in this area , and master of butterfly sample making , I should say .
__label__anger	Yes , I think I did . It has to be one of your maids who took it . I want my necklace back .
__label__noemo	Thanks a lot , Mrs . White .
__label__noemo	Although it is easy to ride , the condition of the road surface should also be paid attention to , such as places being put together and full of gullies . If the condition permits , it is better to be equipped with helmet , eye shades , ankle shield , knee shield and elbow shield .
__label__noemo	This is Mr . Stewart . Who ’ s this ?
__label__noemo	Hey , Mark , long time no see .
__label__noemo	Yes . But if I have any more soup , I think I'll die .
__label__noemo	He stood you up .
__label__noemo	Good . So you will have no trouble finding it .
__label__noemo	How did he know that he had bad mouthed him ?
__label__noemo	You came to the right spot . Come on in and join us !
__label__noemo	Yes . I have written for several top newspapers in the country . I ’ m also in the process of writing my first novel .
__label__noemo	I've been on here for like , 15 minutes .
__label__noemo	Ok .
__label__noemo	How useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?
__label__noemo	And he looks like a typical jog .
__label__noemo	Actually I look at all of it and let's not forget class participation .
__label__noemo	What ? You don ’ t love me ? Me , either .
__label__noemo	My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that !
__label__noemo	I have been coming here for the past few years .
__label__noemo	These are from Guatemala , but we're going to start getting mangoes from India .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid so . We found this crack on the bottom when I went back to my hotel .
__label__noemo	Well , the free stuff ! You know the soap , lotion , shampoo , etc .
__label__noemo	We could provide them with better conditions anyway . We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible .
__label__noemo	And after the meeting ?
__label__joy	Sure . Here you are .
__label__disgust	Because you seem to have lost your vigilance . You should be on the watch out .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__noemo	I know it does seem a little daunting , but once you get used to it , it will save you a lot of time and trouble .
__label__noemo	Thanks . I understand what to do now .
__label__noemo	Yes . I am looking for a restaurant with a cheerful atmosphere .
__label__noemo	Looks like you ’ re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that .
__label__noemo	It fits you to a T .
__label__noemo	That's a big order , Jane . I am really swamped .
__label__noemo	ok . There're vacancies . Since the peak season is coming , it's advisable to book soon . Would you like to make a reservation now ?
__label__noemo	yeah , you should first decide what kind of career you really want , plan your career path , and then try your best to achieve your goal .
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry , Mr . Richard . Mr . Johnson is on his way to the office . He had just called and asked you to wait a minute .
__label__noemo	Probably two days . My wife will join me tomorrow . Then we will decide when to leave for Seattle .
__label__noemo	Oh , really ? are there any snakes ?
__label__disgust	What a boring film !
__label__noemo	No trouble at all . May I know your name and room number ?
__label__noemo	What's this for ?
__label__noemo	5,000 dozen is by no means a large order . In that case , the best I can do is to give you a 5 % reduction .
__label__noemo	Certainly , I can can help you with that . What type of account would you like to open ? A chequing or a savings account ?
__label__noemo	You ’ re right . I love going out and making new friends .
__label__noemo	She's alright .
__label__noemo	My computer won't turn on .
__label__noemo	Could you hold my umbrella when I get my keys out , please ?
__label__noemo	Oh , you are too conservative . It's just realistic .
__label__noemo	You don't have to play that record so loud , do you ?
__label__noemo	What are we going to eat for dinner ?
__label__disgust	In your dreams . Now if you don't mind , I've got some work to do .
__label__noemo	Ok , ok . I'll ask my sister to come . That way we'll have fourteen for dinner .
__label__noemo	What's the problem ?
__label__noemo	You know , sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . They may insist they are sick when they are not .
__label__noemo	Sorry , there is no flight available on July 21st .
__label__noemo	But some women do shake hands . And now a lot of children have such good manners , they shake hands too .
__label__noemo	I see . What time do you want to depart from the hotel ?
__label__anger	Oh , yes , I would !
__label__noemo	Oh , spinach , I think .
__label__noemo	We're completely open on Saturday .
__label__noemo	As the city grew , it must have absorbed many village nearby .
__label__noemo	I have been attending an evening course in English writing for 2 years and I often read novels , magazines and newspapers in English .
__label__noemo	The statue has for a century acted as a figurehead for the American Dream .
__label__noemo	Did you get hit ?
__label__noemo	No , by train . I think it's much safer than bus .
__label__noemo	Then , What ’ s the matter with you my child ?
__label__noemo	Don't ask me . I don't wanna be involved in your quarrel .
__label__noemo	I'm from Korea . My parents wanted me to go to an American university , so I came here .
__label__noemo	What was the most important thing you have learned at work ?
__label__noemo	If you need to cancel your appointment , please give me a call !
__label__noemo	What have you been up to ?
__label__noemo	But yesterday you said you would rent it .
__label__noemo	I know I need to learn that myself , but I just don't have the money for it at the moment . Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place .
__label__noemo	I'm gonna go to the bathroom . When the waitress comes back , will you order for me ?
__label__noemo	Well , we come here almost every month .
__label__joy	Thank you for a wonderful meal .
__label__noemo	Ah , I can do it perfectly .
__label__noemo	Maybe I could buy some Cognac for my brother . He always drinks it .
__label__noemo	Does your wife work ?
__label__noemo	Yes , makes you think , doesn't it ?
__label__joy	It ’ s a good idea . But I am afraid it ’ s too cold . It is very windy on the lake .
__label__noemo	About two month ago .
__label__noemo	That's all right .
__label__noemo	Okay . I ’ ll have them brought to your room right away .
__label__joy	Not bad thanks .
__label__noemo	how are you doing ?
__label__noemo	Well , it ’ s like this , during your first year , you will enjoy this salary level , a year later , we ’ ll increase your salary by 20 % .
__label__joy	Good to meet you , Mr Chettri .
__label__sadness	Can you help me ? You know I do need the scholarship .
__label__noemo	oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .
__label__noemo	Whatever you wear , it should perfectly reflect your confidence and vitality
__label__noemo	I feel the same way .
__label__noemo	Have you received any honors ?
__label__noemo	Not anymore . They live with my brother now . and yours ?
__label__noemo	The color is too bright.For my age , I would prefer a lighter color .
__label__noemo	So , did you want to go ?
__label__noemo	Food is less expensive in a cafeteria , because you serve yourself .
__label__noemo	C'mon . Just don't move .
__label__noemo	Yes , I ’ m new .
__label__noemo	Please go to Counter No . 2 , the foreign exchange counter . It's over there .
__label__noemo	oh , that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .
__label__noemo	Single . What's the fare , PLS ?
__label__noemo	Bucharest , Romania .
__label__noemo	Are there many things online ?
__label__noemo	I have all of that with me . I've also banked here for a number of years .
__label__noemo	By how much ?
__label__noemo	Bring me one and besides , I would like to have a chicken cream soup .
__label__noemo	Can you tell me the results of my home inspection ?
__label__joy	Oh , thanks . Please tell him to call my cell-phone number .
__label__noemo	You ’ re home late today , David . How was school ?
__label__noemo	Of course , we have .
__label__noemo	Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong .
__label__joy	Ok . I ’ m pretty happy and I can go abroad .
__label__noemo	Do you need help setting up or anything ? I don't mind . I like to do that kind of thing . It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating .
__label__noemo	Not bad . Okay , now take some meat and potatoes from the fridge .
__label__noemo	Then what happened ?
__label__joy	Caesar salads are good .
__label__noemo	Hello . miss . I am wondering if there is a meal served on this flight .
__label__noemo	Who are those kids walking down the aisle ?
__label__joy	I'd love to , but my mother asks me to go home before 11:00 every night . She will worry if I get home late .
__label__noemo	Aren't you going to have a holiday abroad this year ?
__label__noemo	For buffet ?
__label__noemo	I live in the dorms across the street , so I ’ ll be OK .
__label__noemo	It costs 125 dollars a month .
__label__noemo	How did you get that burn again ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m very sorry to hear about that . So are you all right ?
__label__noemo	Saving money ? How much money can you save by those 1 or 2 dollar discount coupons ?
__label__noemo	OK . Let's take a walk and look for a shop that does .
__label__noemo	You've really turned into a health nut , haven't you ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I have three sons . Actually I also have a grandson .
__label__noemo	I will just be sincere and friendly to others , and I believe they will treat me the same way .
__label__joy	And disco a kind of nightclub .
__label__noemo	Yes , people surely can . He ’ s whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though .
__label__noemo	No , not at all.it ' s about how to keep fit .
__label__joy	No . I'd like a slide , I have a new projector .
__label__noemo	Yes , how much is the teapot ?
__label__joy	I don't feel bored at all . I'm getting along with my colleagues . I will enjoy working with them . People are great in this industry .
__label__noemo	I think it's time for me to meet my admirer and make him face the music .
__label__noemo	Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .
__label__noemo	The damage and compensation item confuses me . Could you give some explanation ?
__label__noemo	Yes , fine .
__label__noemo	He is on the line .
__label__noemo	I know . I could not believe it when I got hit by that storm . It was pouring with rain all afternoon .
__label__noemo	Yes , we do . I don't have any small pads . I only have large ones . Do you want a pad ?
__label__disgust	Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth !
__label__noemo	No , you'll have to get off at the bank , and take a No . 50 .
__label__noemo	According to the report , our Boston crowd is quite different make-up from our Chicago folks . Our Boston consumers are mostly from mid-level to upper-class income levels , university or postgraduates , married no children , white collar ... You know the kind . Chicago on the other hand is mostly mid to low income levels , single parent homes , blue collar ... I think we're talking about two totally different target groups .
__label__noemo	Yes , that sounds like a winner . Would you please call them to reserve a table ?
__label__noemo	it's his 50th birthday .
__label__noemo	so , what do you think about the place ? Are you glad that you moved in ?
__label__noemo	Oh , yes , my daughter bought it yesterday . We call her Lulu .
__label__noemo	Forget it , there is no use crying over the spilled milk .
__label__joy	Thank you . Please make sure that you pay with cash or a cashier ’ s check .
__label__noemo	Fine . You can either park in the student lot or on the street . Do you know what a handicapped space is ?
__label__noemo	We have just arrived from Tokyo only ... looking for a reserve car of your company . All of above , we cannot find it .
__label__noemo	You can always spot the newbies . I can give you a few pointers if you want . Were you trying to use this machine here ?
__label__noemo	8902365 .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid so except we have many no-show passengers .
__label__noemo	Yes , but I got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry .
__label__noemo	Flight 36 to Washington.It ' ll be on the plane for you .
__label__noemo	No . Now would you like to help me look for the book ?
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	I see . Will you bring a lot of money with you ?
__label__noemo	Just a moment , please . I am sorry , sir . There is no ticket available on that day . But we have flights for Hong Kong the next day .
__label__noemo	Are you in love ?
__label__joy	Hi , Shirley . I'm Sophie . It's nice to meet you .
__label__noemo	My husband and I prefer to have no kids , but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids .
__label__noemo	What breakfast foods ?
__label__joy	You really don ’ t need to .
__label__noemo	I'll use ginger , garlic scallion , hot pepper and vinegar .
__label__noemo	We'll have it for two people .
__label__noemo	Hello , my name is Clark . May I speak to Mr . Allen , please ?
__label__sadness	Honey , please forgive me . There is lots of work to do . So , I forget your birthday .
__label__noemo	What about tonight ? Do you have plans tonight ?
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__joy	When the lower branches are removed , you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree .
__label__noemo	I'm falling in love .
__label__noemo	May I know about the office hours ?
__label__noemo	And how well can you speak them ?
__label__noemo	I think a company is a place to get work done . Certainly friendly , open relationships among all company employees is important , and I think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a professional relationship with the boss .
__label__noemo	Maybe it is . But it ’ s out of fashion .
__label__noemo	Have you ever got the goods on her for wrong doings ?
__label__noemo	is that your rabbit ?
__label__joy	No , seriously . I am impressed .
__label__noemo	What reason do you have for missing school ?
__label__noemo	You have to try at least .
__label__noemo	After you ’ Ve chopped the vegetables , could you fry the meat in a little oil ? Just use a very small amount of oil.Fry the meat until it is cooked , then we will add some spices to flavor it .
__label__noemo	Yes , I think So .
__label__joy	I am really pleased with it .
__label__noemo	It is a six-hour flight with an-hour layover in Los Angles .
__label__noemo	I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line was busy . Will he be back soon ?
__label__noemo	Of course not , help yourself .
__label__noemo	Just kidding , M . Why don't you come work out with me ?
__label__noemo	How's your father been ?
__label__noemo	No , madam.May I help you ?
__label__anger	but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?
__label__noemo	We used to be really close , but that all changed once she moved to Shanghai . How about your family ? You didn ’ t mention to your biological father .
__label__joy	Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 .
__label__noemo	true , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time .
__label__joy	Of course ! Let ’ s have a look . Great ! In my frame of mind , I ’ d like to but one today .
__label__noemo	not really . I may have some occasionally for a chance . But I don't indulge myself too much .
__label__noemo	What places of interest did you show them ?
__label__noemo	You ’ re a wonderful person , Kathleen .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry sir . I can't let you pass .
__label__noemo	Do I have any other choices ?
__label__noemo	Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills .
__label__noemo	Alright , sir . You are making a good choice . Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord .
__label__noemo	And there are Cantonese cuisine and Kiangsu cuisine .. Most people like them .
__label__noemo	Sure ! It's txyb@gmail.com .
__label__noemo	That's fine .
__label__noemo	then what ? Your plane was three hours late !
__label__joy	Yeah , that is the holiday is hot , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load .
__label__joy	Oh , that is wonderful . Congratulations !
__label__noemo	Yes . And could I have your name ?
__label__noemo	I know . I really want to go to the beach .
__label__joy	That ’ s right . Plus , I agree with his policies .
__label__noemo	I was thinking of taking off from September first until the thirtieth . Would you be okay with that ?
__label__noemo	Okay . The library's beside the baker's . I'd better take back the videos we borrowed last week . They're overdue .
__label__joy	I believe you are cut out for this position .
__label__noemo	Do you have a reservation , sir ?
__label__noemo	You married Joe , didn't you ?
__label__noemo	The doctors and the nurses will help you . And I will be waiting for you right here , praying for you and our baby .
__label__noemo	Do you have the same in different sizes ? The trousers are too long for me .
__label__joy	You bet .
__label__noemo	No , I'm not very good at it . I play just for the fun of it .
__label__noemo	Have you ever had snow in your city ?
__label__noemo	Oh , cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything .
__label__noemo	Well , perhaps , another time .
__label__noemo	And please send this letter by registered mail .
__label__joy	Why don ’ t we go together ? I can show you around . I think you ’ ll have a better time .
__label__noemo	The next bus will be here in four minutes .
__label__noemo	Yes . Go straight ahead till you come to the traffic lights , turn left there and it's the first turning on the right .
__label__noemo	No , really . Look . It's got a double time zone setting .
__label__joy	Oh , thanks a lot . Then , I will take the two .
__label__noemo	Dad , it's raining outside .
__label__noemo	Well , I trust that your presence will hasten the settlement of payment terms .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	oh , they look nice . May I try that back one on ?
__label__noemo	You sound like you're afraid .
__label__noemo	I was a runner_a long-distance runner .
__label__noemo	Yes , I have worked for four years with a Canadian Company .
__label__noemo	What are you majoring in ?
__label__joy	Thanks honey ! You have such great fashion sense.Now , what am I going to do with my hair ?
__label__noemo	Yes , are advance tickets for ' Nut croakers ' still available ?
__label__noemo	Yes , actually , I did make a little bit of money .
__label__noemo	What time exactly ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I ’ m sorry , Ms . Montgomery . I ’ ll come back later .
__label__noemo	It's Saturday . Could you make the time ?
__label__noemo	Here is the ticket .
__label__noemo	Look at the icon in the bottom corner of your screen . Is it flashing ?
__label__noemo	What are you reading ? You've had your nose buried in that book since last night .
__label__noemo	Can you make it ?
__label__noemo	Where do you want to be in five years ?
__label__noemo	just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset .
__label__noemo	How can we help him ?
__label__joy	Of course . I can't live without it , so I always bring my CD with me no matter where I go .
__label__noemo	It shouldn't be a problem .
__label__noemo	We think the price is too high .
__label__noemo	What makes you say that ?
__label__noemo	Oh . So you think you can just do whatever you want , do you ?
__label__noemo	I have been having a lot of headaches lately .
__label__noemo	Yes . My country is certainly expanding in the service and hi-tech sectors , but contracting in the heavy industry and primary industry sectors . However , our car and aircraft manufacturers are doing very well .
__label__noemo	I ’ d like to , but there ’ s her boyfriend . He ’ s very broad-shouldered .
__label__noemo	I ’ d like to make a collect call to Beijing China , please .
__label__noemo	What's that ?
__label__noemo	My son . He is two years old .
__label__noemo	Dad , you talk well , but can you appreciate that kind of art ?
__label__noemo	OK . You can change it .
__label__noemo	I am a vegetarian . Do you have any vegetarian selections ?
__label__noemo	Be yourself and be honest . Simply answer the questions put to you .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t feel so good . I am feeling sick to my stomach .
__label__joy	Very well , I'll take these two .
__label__noemo	So , I wish to apply for the sole agency of your product in our local market . If you give us the agency , that will be more substantial for our cooperation .
__label__noemo	I like doughnuts .
__label__noemo	Oh , Lord , no . Those are ugly . What else do you have ?
__label__joy	Well , it's good that you're so talented .
__label__noemo	Is there a lot of crime in your city ?
__label__noemo	White , please
__label__noemo	Hello , Mary .
__label__noemo	You can list your education at the top , or choose your job experience to be there if it is more impressive .
__label__noemo	The Employment Development Office will call you for an interview .
__label__noemo	I got rid of that clunker . This is my new one .
__label__noemo	That's why I still have very high hopes for the team . Now that the tournament has proceeded into the knock-out stage , the Germans will probably make it through to the finals .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid you can't smoke here .
__label__noemo	To tell you the truth , I am on the diet .
__label__noemo	No problem . May I see your receipt , please ?
__label__noemo	That happened to my oldest girl . She became really upset when her classmates told her Santa wasn't real .
__label__noemo	Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right .
__label__noemo	What is it about this job that appeals to you ?
__label__noemo	How hard is the climb ?
__label__noemo	I see . All right , then . Thanks .
__label__joy	Well . It ’ s certainly nice . You ’ Ve done a great job .
__label__joy	Of course ! Everything at Helen ’ s is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn ’ t you shop around ?
__label__noemo	I can try , but knowing Margaret she will see through that immediately .
__label__noemo	No , that ’ s it . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Come on . Dating is a part of young people's social life . Besides , you're sixteen already .
__label__disgust	Any body piercing ? Stick out your tongue !
__label__noemo	Don't you like fish then ?
__label__noemo	You mean my favorite movie of all time ? I guess I ’ d have to say “ pretty woman ” .
__label__noemo	Help you in the kitchen , I don ’ t feel like it .
__label__noemo	No problem . I just got paid.It ' s my treat .
__label__noemo	What if old people are in poor health and need to be looked after ?
__label__noemo	Well , I suppose one of the problems is ... will depend on what a person's life style is , and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television , he will then , you know , hmm . be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things .
__label__noemo	What are your salary expectations ?
__label__noemo	I'm afraid so , yes .
__label__noemo	You know that you ’ ll have to pay utilities on top of the rent , right ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I know it is one of the leading industries in the petrochemical field .
__label__joy	I just wanted to say thanks for putting us on the map so fast . I appreciate it .
__label__noemo	Well , the good news is the new industrial cleaning products really took off . Look how the sales have shot up over the last two weeks .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'll take it . Are there any jeans ? Xiaohui's jeans are always dirty . I also need four pairs of slippers .
__label__noemo	Let me know if you do need anything .
__label__noemo	Did you hear ? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business !
__label__surprise	dumplings again ? ! Oh , Amy , let's try something new !
__label__noemo	May I help you , sir ?
__label__noemo	That'll make it impossible for me to use .
__label__noemo	You look tired .
__label__noemo	That would be great .
__label__noemo	That's a great idea . Let's go to a Chinese restaurant .
__label__noemo	Straight , I think , and about average length .
__label__noemo	What happened ?
__label__noemo	Couldn't be better .
__label__noemo	Thank you . Please bring me some paper napkins .
__label__noemo	No , It's only about five minutes ' walk .
__label__noemo	I can't find the price tag .
__label__noemo	How long will it take ?
__label__surprise	What ? Again ? Why do you keep running out of money ?
__label__noemo	How did you like the movie ?
__label__noemo	You should open an account at the online bank first . After that , you can buy anything online .
__label__surprise	Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work .
__label__joy	I've actually never tried . Do you have a surfboard ?
__label__noemo	I received a bachelor's degree .
__label__noemo	What types of medications would be best ?
__label__noemo	Fine , thanks .
__label__noemo	Same here.Have you seen any new films recently ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I do . Do you accept American Express ?
__label__joy	Great . I have long been looking forward to there .
__label__joy	Not at all . You can ask the policeman over there .
__label__noemo	That's only for your theory foundation . I am afraid if you have ever handled large amounts of cash before ?
__label__noemo	I did it .
__label__joy	Really ? that's interesting !
__label__noemo	Julia , I have good news for you .
__label__noemo	Hey , let's go for a spin . You can try it out .
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	I went to Tamshui . You ?
__label__noemo	I am not sure . What are you doing ?
__label__noemo	Walk the sidewalk and please right-hand side .
__label__joy	It all sounds so relaxing . I wish I could get away to the beach like that .
__label__noemo	Don't you know that ? It's panda .
__label__noemo	I'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the IT field .
__label__noemo	Well , it was all a big mistake , actually . He got home on Friday night really late , and apparently he'd been out drinking with some clients , so he was really drunk .
__label__noemo	I heard you got a new roommate . What's he like ?
__label__joy	Have you visited it before ?
__label__joy	I'm glad that you think so . I thought it might be a bit too revealing .
__label__sadness	I know ... I know ... it's all my fault . I feel awful that I didn ’ t study , and I cheated , and I got caught .
__label__noemo	That is what tornadoes sound like . They sound like trains . They're very loud .
__label__noemo	Would you come to spend the weekend with us ?
__label__noemo	What kind of magazine is it ?
__label__noemo	And the streets are covered with ice . Do you know what the temperature is today ?
__label__noemo	Do people get married young ?
__label__noemo	Have you got a headache ?
__label__noemo	Yes , a dish of cream of wheat .
__label__noemo	If you take out the garbage and do the dishes , I'll think about it .
__label__noemo	I can ’ t help you with that .
__label__noemo	Well . Have you got his permission ?
__label__noemo	not really , but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t worry . It ’ ll probably take you about three weeks to get everything organized .
__label__noemo	Well , I remember walking pass the baker shop .
__label__noemo	Take it easy . I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . I hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job .
__label__noemo	That's acceptable . No one wants to miss a train .
__label__noemo	What race is he ?
__label__joy	I just love your hair that way .
__label__noemo	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	That ’ s all right .
__label__noemo	Good morning , madam .
__label__noemo	What do you need me for ?
__label__noemo	Aisle A is where you'll find all the produce .
__label__noemo	What ’ re you doing now ?
__label__noemo	Yes . When is the next train to New York City ?
__label__noemo	No , I don ’ t think so . I know Mary . Once she makes a decision , she won ’ t change her mind .
__label__joy	Yes , it's been marvelous . It really was very kind of you to invite me . I hope it hasn't been too much trouble .
__label__noemo	Right.How are you going to spend your weekend ?
__label__joy	Well , this is my new baby . He ’ s just as much trouble . That ’ s for sure ! But , he ’ s a lot of fun !
__label__noemo	Can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 10 ?
__label__joy	Would you like to have dinner with me at King Hotel at 7pm ?
__label__noemo	Marry ; Mr . Johnson wants these documents to be copied .
__label__noemo	Well , I talk to myself . That is , I play one role first , than the other .
__label__noemo	Well , your job is to compile and analyze financial information to prepare entries to accounts . You ’ re also responsible for preparing profit and loss statements and monthly closing and cost accounting reports .
__label__noemo	It's TH 15699324873 0 .
__label__noemo	Hi , I'm here to look at the one-bedroom apartment you have for rent .
__label__noemo	Mr . : Why don't you sit behind Brad ?
__label__noemo	I always catch this bus .
__label__noemo	May I have your name , please ?
__label__noemo	Tuesday would be good for me .
__label__noemo	Let me check . Yes , we can .
__label__noemo	OK , murder will out !
__label__noemo	0K . Well , I suppose I have no choice . What do you want me to do ?
__label__sadness	The time has come to say goodbye .
__label__noemo	Hope we have good luck .
__label__noemo	I finished Young Primary School in 1998 , and entered Xi ’ an Middle School that same September . I graduated from there in July of 2004 , and that September I entered Wuhan University , where I'm studying now .
__label__noemo	I agree , how much ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I ’ Ve looked everywhere downstairs .
__label__noemo	That ’ s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time
__label__noemo	Are you upset ?
__label__joy	Yes , I'm very pleased . I've just got two tickets to see the Olympic opening ceremony .
__label__noemo	I surely will . How much is this wood carving ?
__label__noemo	Everyone has a one-week waiting period before they can collect .
__label__noemo	You should get plenty of sleep .
__label__noemo	You are so old-fashioned . I have already watched it last week in cinema .
__label__noemo	If it goes beyond the basic deposit , the agreement will be settled at the rate agreement savings which has been determined by the People's Bank of China on the day you wish to settle or withdraw .
__label__noemo	Is it because of the bad weather ? It's been really miserable for the past tew days .
__label__noemo	Mm , let me see . I think there are 2 in the bedroom , and 1 each in the living room and kitchen .
__label__noemo	If I let you go back to sleep , I know that you won't get up in five minutes .
__label__noemo	What kinds of questions did she ask you ?
__label__sadness	I am sorry , you have the wrong number .
__label__noemo	I have a little problem with room 507 .
__label__noemo	Shall we go downtown for a movie this Friday evening ?
__label__noemo	Is this Taiwan 8234342 2 , DS engineering ?
__label__noemo	All right , I see what you mean .
__label__noemo	Let me think . How much did you have in mind ?
__label__joy	You really have bad luck , don't you ?
__label__noemo	I see you sometimes work on weekends , too .
__label__noemo	I'm sure whatever you offer will be a fair amount for a person with my qualifications . Salary is not the most important factor to me . I'm looking for opportunity .
__label__noemo	Yes , It's Henrylee@yahoo.com .
__label__noemo	I see , so it's similar to global warming ?
__label__noemo	If it's within the legal limit , I prefer to keep it .
__label__noemo	That ’ s great . Where did you stay ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s right , and it looks like we ’ re just about ready to start the match . The ref is calling the players for the face-off ... and here we go ! The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! Federal gets checked hard into the boards !
__label__noemo	Bye-bye !
__label__noemo	We might be getting one in the near future . But at the present time , no .
__label__noemo	Maybe it is . But it ’ s out of fashion .
__label__noemo	We actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos .
__label__joy	Have a nice journey , Lily .
__label__noemo	How is your English ability ?
__label__noemo	So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?
__label__noemo	I was regional champion for the 100 and 200 meters . I usually did well in the dong jump competitions , but I couldn ’ t compete with kids from other schools in the javelin . How about you ?
__label__joy	OK . Yeah ! Yeah !
__label__noemo	What does that sign say ?
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	What ? Where does that five come from ?
__label__noemo	Same here . Hey , did you know Susan is going to get married . She invited me to her wedding and she wants you to attend also .
__label__noemo	No thanks . We just need our check . Have you seen the waitress ?
__label__noemo	4434 1234 5678 9902 ?
__label__noemo	Let me see a doctor .
__label__noemo	That was my fault . I'm sorry .
__label__noemo	Dad , you've been driving for three hours . Why don't we have a switch ?
__label__anger	Man ! That car almost hit me !

__label__noemo	Photograph .
__label__joy	I read that story too . They seem to be able to understand men .
__label__noemo	I would really prefer an outside table . Would that be possible ?
__label__noemo	Of course , easy.No sweat .
__label__noemo	RIB .
__label__noemo	It might be . You'd better take a heavy sweater with you.The nights are usually quite cold at this time of year .
__label__noemo	Would you have time to go look at apartments with me ?
__label__noemo	Okay , what package would you like to order ?
__label__joy	Thank you for calling us . We'll be expecting you next Monday .
__label__noemo	The gym is open seven days a week , twenty-four hours a day .
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve a lot of paper work to do right now . I ’ m behind schedule .
__label__noemo	I sent my resume to a computer company and am waiting for their call .
__label__noemo	What do you consider to be your strong points ?
__label__noemo	I want to check out these books .
__label__noemo	Why do you plan to change your job ?
__label__noemo	Right . Stop thinking about it . Where do you think we can save more money ?
__label__noemo	I twisted and turned all night , and couldn ’ t sleep . I was worried about my mother ’ s health .
__label__joy	Pretty good .
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	Sure , just a moment . ... I'm sorry no one answer the phone .
__label__noemo	You can choose classes that you like at the school office .
__label__noemo	But everything has been so easy .
__label__noemo	How did I do ?
__label__noemo	I was just thinking of going to a movie tonight .
__label__noemo	This is a really great place to watch a baseball game .
__label__noemo	Hello ! Do you have a place where I can exercise ?
__label__noemo	First off , I'm going to need a pound of ground beef .
__label__noemo	Yeah , Why ?
__label__noemo	Why not ? There ’ s not much time left . Are you short of cash ?
__label__noemo	Ok .
__label__noemo	Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
__label__noemo	Hello , sir . Have you anything to declare ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry , my watch has stopped .
__label__noemo	Do you live with your parents ?
__label__noemo	We're using worms .
__label__noemo	Yes , I ’ m a singer .
__label__noemo	Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything .
__label__noemo	Mary , you say something about it .
__label__noemo	Three or four days , perhaps longer .
__label__noemo	Fine , but next time try and not have to miss class again .
__label__noemo	Fine . They should be here the day after tomorrow .
__label__joy	That's a good idea . Let's bring our trunks and towels .
__label__joy	It can't be expressed by words .
__label__noemo	Yes , because I love yours .
__label__noemo	What's the difference between an outlet and a regular store ?
__label__noemo	Are you still mad at her now ?
__label__joy	You're right . I love going out and making new friends .
__label__joy	Thank you . See you .
__label__joy	Really , it's so beautiful .
__label__noemo	Paris in the Spring .
__label__noemo	Are you even listening ? I ’ m trying to have a conversation with you .
__label__noemo	That's not my fault .
__label__noemo	Sorry , Sir , but it's 5 working days . This does not include weekends , so your card should be with you later this week .
__label__noemo	I'd like it well done , please .
__label__noemo	The work is rather hard , but it's interesting .
__label__noemo	What position did you play ?
__label__joy	They're also good for your digestion ! Would you like some kiwis , too ?
__label__noemo	Oh , she's nice . How much is she ?
__label__noemo	No , I'm not feeling myself . I just want to check my emails , visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends .
__label__joy	That's fine .
__label__noemo	I am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 PM this Thursday afternoon . Please come on time .
__label__noemo	OK . I'll do that .
__label__joy	It's no trouble at all because your house is on the way to my place .
__label__noemo	Do you mind if I sit down ?
__label__noemo	How are you going all these days ?
__label__noemo	I really feel bad about it . Let me buy you a new one .
__label__noemo	Would you like to call home ?
__label__noemo	Glad to meet you.Would you mind if I ask you some questions ?
__label__noemo	I don't think much of the film .
__label__noemo	I would say it's about 5 degree Celsius .
__label__noemo	So I have , but I has reminded me at least one thing I need to remember .
__label__noemo	I knew we'd find the right pan sooner or later . How would you like to pay ?
__label__anger	Yes , that was probably it ! It isn't fair .
__label__fear	I'm in such a need of the job that I can't afford any mistakes .
__label__noemo	Take some medicine and stay in bed for a day or two .
__label__noemo	According to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation .
__label__noemo	So far we could only deduce this way.If you want further information , would you please call us 1 hour later ?
__label__noemo	So what happened next ?
__label__noemo	That's great ! What comes along with Moutan ?
__label__noemo	You ’ re lucky you start to learn it so easily . I learned English very late , and learned it all by myself . At that time we didn ’ t have a good English studying environment . I have to keep my dictionary on hand .
__label__noemo	how often do you usually cook ?
__label__noemo	You mean the kind of stuff like Nirvana ?
__label__noemo	One way .
__label__noemo	What ’ s on ?
__label__noemo	How ?
__label__noemo	Of course . I stay online for four hours at least every day .
__label__joy	Do you ? Nice to meet you ! And here is the invoice and your change .
__label__noemo	Are you sure ?
__label__noemo	Well , that's okay .
__label__surprise	Wow ! What a hit !
__label__joy	Pretty well , thanks . Still feeling the effects of jet lag a bit , but last night I got at lease six hours of rest .
__label__noemo	I am just waiting for my friends . It won't be long .
__label__noemo	What's happening , officer ?
__label__noemo	I like rumba and tango .
__label__noemo	By the way , do I need a transfer again after No . 50 ?
__label__noemo	Oh , yes !
__label__noemo	Let's order something to eat . What are you in the mood for ?
__label__noemo	We don't .
__label__noemo	It is in front of you .
__label__noemo	I don't think so . It's brand-new .
__label__noemo	Okay , I'm sorry . I believe you .
__label__noemo	What time would be best for you ?
__label__noemo	Did he crash ?
__label__noemo	Unfortunately , you won ’ t be getting a rent check unless these problems are fixed by Friday .
__label__joy	Thanks very much .
__label__noemo	How about overtime work ?
__label__noemo	Her roommate , Malia , might know what her favorite groups are .
__label__noemo	Hello , Walter ?
__label__noemo	Good morning . sir . How may I serve you today ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s normal after a tense work evening . Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either . Once , I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend . That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later .
__label__noemo	Please , call me Ted .
__label__noemo	I've got a suit , a woolen sweater and a white shirt to wash .
__label__joy	She is expecting .
__label__noemo	OK , I see . As far as you think , how many buses should we get for them ?
__label__noemo	Here you go . Can I deposit some into my account and take some in cash ? I need 1,000 RIB for my expenses , you see .
__label__noemo	What are you talking about ?
__label__noemo	I want to find a book called Gone with the Wind.But I can't find it .
__label__noemo	Not always . But they like a good meal . Lots of tourists go to Rome just for the food , you know .
__label__joy	Oh , photography , It ’ s really a good hobby .
__label__anger	I want to file a complaint .
__label__noemo	I've heard that you are going to call for a tender . What kind of goods would you like to buy ?
__label__surprise	It's my new radio earphone .
__label__noemo	I guess it lets people express their individual tastes . But won't some people abuse it ?
__label__noemo	You are very optimistic !
__label__noemo	And how do you like working for IBM ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I probably could .
__label__noemo	Okay , I'll take the roses .
__label__noemo	Yes , but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
__label__noemo	Afraid so . The more the better .
__label__noemo	I ’ m kind of useless in that area , but I ’ ll take a look at it .
__label__noemo	Do you have any carry-on luggage ?
__label__noemo	Do you have any tangerines ? I'd like to have two kilograms .
__label__noemo	I will leave a memo for you , sir .
__label__noemo	I knew there would be a shower , but I didn't realize it would rain cats and dogs today .
__label__noemo	I think I should join a fitness centre . I am getting a little fat and I'm totally out of shape . Even a quick walk of a few hundred metres leaves me out of breath .
__label__joy	It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ?
__label__noemo	Are there other chores for us to do ?
__label__noemo	Bite your tongue ! I ’ m already at the end of my rope . Some nights I don ’ t sleep at all . John manages to sleep like a log even when the babies are screaming at the top of their lungs .
__label__noemo	I like Brisbane . I had my teenage years in Brisbane , growing up in Brisbane , um or maybe Sidney because it is a big city , but Brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine .
__label__noemo	What are your future plans and what kind of expectations do you have of the company ?
__label__joy	Yeah , falling in love is so good .
__label__joy	Really ? Great !
__label__noemo	So what items must be involved in this report ?
__label__noemo	Not bad .
__label__noemo	That ’ s way too much .
__label__joy	I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado ; but I must admit , this sure is a nice spring day .
__label__noemo	That ’ s a really long line . How long do you think it ’ ll take to get through all those people ?
__label__noemo	Mmm ... does it zip closed ?
__label__noemo	There is a new coffee shop opening up down the street .
__label__noemo	Hello , how can I be of service ?
__label__noemo	Two waves ?
__label__noemo	What sports do you like best ?
__label__noemo	I always do . Did you go to school today ?
__label__noemo	Nope . I guess something might have come up .
__label__sadness	I am sorry , there are so many travelers that all our tables have been booked on that day .
__label__noemo	Have you noticed what has changed ?
__label__noemo	The car isn't running smoothly . I'd like to have a look at it .
__label__noemo	any other ideas ?
__label__noemo	Can I help ?
__label__noemo	I have no choice . My mother is always very strict with me .
__label__noemo	I think one of my fillings might be coming loose .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , I bought this sweater yesterday . But when I got home and tried it on , I found it ’ s too small .
__label__noemo	Are there certain things that I should avoid ?
__label__noemo	What time am I supposed to pick you up ?
__label__noemo	I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers .
__label__noemo	I'm reading a novel , The mill on the floss , written by the famous novelist gorge alias .
__label__noemo	I started school somewhere else .
__label__noemo	Nothing exactly . She's grown into a very attractive young lady .
__label__noemo	Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave .
__label__joy	Well done . You got them all . You get 10 points and your next two bowls are added to this frame's score . I'II dry my ball off and try to knock them all down as well .
__label__noemo	We are on the way to the Wall Street .
__label__noemo	Shrimp salad . And what kind of pie do you have ?
__label__noemo	Everything has gone as smooth as clockwork . Just like we planned ! That may be true , but if you were to do it , you would have trouble on the horizon . You always say that .
__label__noemo	I forgot about the potatoes . Oh , I almost forget that we need a microwave oven badly . What kind of tea do you prefer ? Green tea or flower tea ?
__label__noemo	( After trying ) Mm , a perfect fit . How much ?
__label__noemo	Where do mangoes come from ?
__label__joy	It's a good idea .
__label__joy	OK.It ' s delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh .
__label__noemo	What type of tools ?
__label__noemo	Could I speak to Diana Curzon ?
__label__noemo	Here you are , sir . I hope you enjoyed your dinner .
__label__noemo	He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
__label__noemo	Let me check ... what's your voucher number ?
__label__noemo	Mr . Crandall , I ’ m sorry , but I really don ’ t see the value in doing this entire project over from scratch . It would take a lot of work .
__label__noemo	This little wooden stick is called a tee .
__label__noemo	Do you want to go out to eat ?
__label__noemo	I was sitting there giving out nametags and all of a sudden , there she was .
__label__noemo	It is hard to say.But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant.Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy .
__label__noemo	A flea market is an outdoor place where people sell all kinds of used stuff .
__label__joy	Actually , I could use some help . Thank you so much .
__label__noemo	Yes , I am . What's wrong ?
__label__noemo	well , skip over all of that and read me the rest .
__label__noemo	Yeah . I need to get some stuff .
__label__noemo	I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ?
__label__joy	Won't he be surprised !
__label__noemo	Will you be done doing my hair soon ?
__label__joy	Yes . It's really wonderful here The grass is greener and the air is fresher than those in the city .
__label__noemo	Can I answer it in Chinese ?
__label__noemo	Let's just rent one this time . The AC is broken in the truck , remember ?
__label__noemo	Both of them speak excellent French . But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does .
__label__noemo	I think you should definitely apply for the position .
__label__noemo	Isn't there some way you could work your schedule out to be here ?
__label__noemo	Our fruit is very fresh today . Do you want some ?
__label__joy	Hey , Daddy , today I had really a fantastic history class .
__label__noemo	But one must have some basic ideas about nutrition and find the best way for the nutrients to work out for the body .
__label__noemo	Oh , my God ! It ’ s my stomach . It ’ s killing me !
__label__noemo	What about this picture ? I think Benjamin would like it .
__label__noemo	Yes . You sure have come a long way in valuing your hard earned dollars .
__label__noemo	No . We couldn ’ t possibly .
__label__noemo	Oh , is that all ?
__label__noemo	you bet it !
__label__noemo	May I make a reservation ?
__label__joy	Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen .
__label__noemo	Oh , i almost forgot . Today is my mom's birthday .
__label__noemo	Do you think your English is good enough to do office work ?
__label__joy	Oh , that ’ s a nice idea . Well , it ’ s fine if you take our picture .
__label__noemo	There's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around .
__label__joy	Thank you , David .
__label__noemo	What's in the bag ? Would you mind opening the bag ?
__label__joy	I know there is a beautiful farm in the countryside near Taipei . Are you interested in going there ?
__label__noemo	No .
__label__noemo	How long has she lived there ?
__label__noemo	She ’ s my friend ’ s ten-year-old niece . I guess there won ’ t be another wedding in this family for a long time .
__label__noemo	Let's see . Yes . You ' Ve got quite a high temperature .
__label__noemo	I am afraid so . I am terribly sorry !
__label__noemo	I usually do housework in mornings . I go shopping occasionally . I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket . I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center . It takes about 20 minutes to drive there .
__label__joy	Wow . You must be very excited .
__label__noemo	Well , I thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today . That is , if you haven't promised to go with someone else .
__label__noemo	Yes , sir . It is Jane . It was given by my English professor when I was at the university .
__label__noemo	Yes , I have one . When you need it ?
__label__noemo	Oh , about seven years . Time flies , you know !
__label__noemo	Not bad .
__label__surprise	No , it can't be . Really ? Who ?
__label__noemo	Yeah . Oh well , how about a game of cards instead ?
__label__noemo	OK , I'll take it .
__label__noemo	Thanks , it hasn ’ t been easy , but luckily we have life insurance and Wendy left behind a detailed will that will sort out any other legal matters .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t worry , we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed , pressure-free shopping environment . That stone is an amethyst . We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces . Take a look at this bracelet . It ’ s 18K rose-gold , studded with amethyst and blue topaz . It ’ s a great statement piece .
__label__noemo	Now that I think of it , three days is better than seven .
__label__noemo	this way , please . Here they are . They're all handmade .
__label__noemo	Today is Thursday .
__label__noemo	Hi , good morning , Miss ? what can I help you with ?
__label__joy	Nearly everything .
__label__noemo	Let me see . It's a one day tour .
__label__noemo	Nice to meet you . How can I help you ?
__label__joy	This website offers very convenient air tickets booking service . It is quick and accurate .
__label__joy	Thanks very much for your help .
__label__sadness	I know , Janet . I just walked out and forgot it completely . I ’ ll go home and get it at noon , all right ?
__label__noemo	I think this one fits you . It's the new fashion style .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t complain about it . She is concerned about your safety .
__label__noemo	Well , you can ’ t give her granny panties.Have you thought about getting her somesleepwear ? We ’ Ve got these lovely , silky nighties . Or , how about a nice panty-and and-bra set . Look , here ’ s a nice satin push-up bra , and you can choose a few different styles of undies to go with it .
__label__noemo	Sorry . What shall we get for her ?
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	You have to bring me an add sheet to sign . Do you have one ?
__label__noemo	He's very strict with us .

__label__noemo	OK , thank you !
__label__joy	We appreciate your help .
__label__joy	Lisa , I'm so glad to see you . How are you doing ?
__label__noemo	I think that the doctor had better see you . I'll telephone Dr Carter . The doctor says that he will come at once . I'm sure that you need an X-ray , Andy .
__label__noemo	Then we drive west on the M25 . we must be careful to turn in the right direction !
__label__noemo	I'm afraid I lost my ticket . Can I buy one again now ?
__label__noemo	Good morning ! Welcome to our office !
__label__surprise	You're being serious ?
__label__noemo	The information is scanty for me . And can you describe the responsibilities of the position ?
__label__noemo	Yes . This is room 207 . There isn't any hot water in my bath room . Can you send somebody here , and do something about it ?
__label__noemo	I'm going out right now . But that's all right , you can come when I've gone .
__label__noemo	Ah ! You're bleeding all over ! What happened ?
__label__joy	That's good , we can share what we have . Here we are . You go ahead .
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	What were the odds ?
__label__noemo	Take the next right . Drive about one click further , and you ’ ll see the entrance of the highway to the Great Wall .
__label__noemo	That chair over there , but please be careful with it . It was a gift from my mother-in-law .
__label__noemo	I never have seasonal allergies .
__label__noemo	I am not certain , but I think I might ask to be considered for the new job .
__label__noemo	I'd like to buy a tapestry to decorate my new room .
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__noemo	I ’ m not sure now . In any case , let ’ s first make some careful investigations .
__label__surprise	Oh dear , is it really my turn ? In that case , I'll clean tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Sure . But my beard is rough .

__label__joy	I'll go together with you .
__label__noemo	I'm not sure .
__label__noemo	Yes . I'll welcome other opportunities to do business with you .
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__noemo	Can I help you , sir ?
__label__joy	Yes , I am lucky . I was born on Christ ’ s birthday . Maybe that is why I usually go to church on Sundays . When is your birthday ?
__label__joy	Tomorrow's Carl's birthday ?
__label__noemo	Mm-hm . How long were you there ?
__label__noemo	Do you like to drive the bus ?
__label__noemo	For sure ! I mean we ’ Ve learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding , how to check for a pulse , and even how to apply CPR !
__label__noemo	Have you decided whether or not you would like to go ?
__label__noemo	And you want to know what to wear ?
__label__noemo	I am worried about my future . I can't believe that our company is as big as it is . The company can only continue to grow by taking care of its staff .
__label__noemo	NO !
__label__noemo	What face ?
__label__noemo	I am not feeling very well . I've got a bad cold .
__label__noemo	What about the registration procedure ? Is that complicated ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I'd like to move to another room .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . I have just missed the connection plane due to the heavy fog in London . Can I change my ticket now ?
__label__noemo	Under 300,000 RIB , we suppose .
__label__joy	I think it's a brilliant advert ! It really grabs my attention !
__label__noemo	OK . I want it a bit close around the waist .
__label__noemo	I see . What did you tell her ?
__label__noemo	If you aren ’ t there , we will use our master key to get in and check things out .
__label__joy	I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all .
__label__noemo	you ’ re right . By the way , did you hear that tom inherited some money recently ?
__label__surprise	Why ? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live .
__label__noemo	Yes . I ’ d like to make an appointment with Dr . Galas . Could you arrange it for me ?
__label__noemo	Do you want to eat breakfast here ?
__label__joy	that's a good idea .
__label__noemo	No , not much . In fact , nothing ever really happens . That's the trouble .
__label__noemo	How about you see a movie with me and my friend ?
__label__noemo	If I were him , I would give him a good talking-to . I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that .
__label__noemo	I'm a flight attendant and I'm here on vacation .
__label__noemo	Yes . We set up the new alarm system a few months ago .
__label__joy	You spoken English is pretty good . Please tell me your experience in learning English .
__label__noemo	How much again ?
__label__noemo	I'm finished .
__label__noemo	Chicken !
__label__noemo	Yes , I have learned a little French and Japanese as well .
__label__noemo	Susan , I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend .
__label__noemo	That is a perfect reason to like a certain kind of music .
__label__noemo	Hello ! I'd like to get busy on my computer , but I need some broadband .
__label__noemo	Will you be joining Billy and I at the Bar ?
__label__noemo	OK , please be seated . May I have your name , please ?
__label__noemo	Are the expressions of sight draft , time draft , usance draft and letter of credit adequate terms to express the different methods of payment ?
__label__noemo	Be quick , please . Our teacher and classmates will come soon .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__sadness	Mine are the same way . It seems like they've been overcooked .
__label__noemo	Hello , Is that Stefan ?
__label__noemo	Hello , Helen , have you heard the news ? There ’ s been a horrible accident .
__label__noemo	Will it hurt much ?
__label__noemo	even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ?
__label__noemo	What do you think ?
__label__noemo	David , what's new with you ? You are not in the mood . Can you tell me ?
__label__noemo	I see , sir . Can you come back for a fitting on the 10th , that's in a week's time ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I do . I don ’ t like it very much .
__label__noemo	Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ?
__label__noemo	Hello , Westhaven Company .
__label__noemo	I'd like to check in on October 12th and check out the 15th .
__label__noemo	I am glad that that works out ; can you find my office ?
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__joy	We can hold them until one day before the show .
__label__noemo	Thirty for each adult , twenty each kid .
__label__noemo	All photography shops carry them .
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry to disturb you , Mr . Crane .
__label__noemo	If I were you , I'd buy .
__label__noemo	Thank you , sir . Now , do you have a credit card , sir ?
__label__noemo	yes . I'm just waiting until I officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa .
__label__noemo	The bathroom sink is stopped up .
__label__noemo	Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae ?
__label__noemo	Do you have the workers to save me if anything should happen ?
__label__noemo	Of course . First , use eye shadow to heighten your eyes .
__label__noemo	She's far better than my old boss . He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down .
__label__noemo	What bad luck !
__label__noemo	If so , we may live there someday .
__label__noemo	That's fine . Could you give me some more napkins , too ?
__label__noemo	Oh , while we're on the subject , what happened to you and your secretary ?
__label__noemo	Hello , I ’ m Mark . I ’ m just wondering if you are free this weekend
__label__noemo	Ever since I saw computer can do your project , I wanted to have a computer .
__label__noemo	Highway miles are not as bad as local miles . They do not hurt car as much .
__label__noemo	isn't there anything else ?
__label__noemo	Sure , what's the author's name , please .
__label__disgust	Yes . It is one of the most harmful computer viruses in the world . People say it will break out again om Valentines ' Day this year .
__label__noemo	I thought she'd be happy .
__label__noemo	You're looking rather pale , why ?

__label__noemo	Would you like some soup first ?
__label__noemo	Is it near here ?

__label__noemo	"I said , "" Do you want me to help you ? """

__label__noemo	How far do we have to go ?
__label__noemo	Won ’ t you get lonely ?

__label__noemo	I see.What if the person wanted is out ?
__label__noemo	How do you usually part your hair ?
__label__noemo	To the front desk .
__label__noemo	The account is a compound savings account , which is in RIB and Forex .
__label__noemo	I think it is amazing . You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway .
__label__noemo	This refers to the deposit business offered to the level 1 account of group companies .

__label__noemo	Does this title come with an increase in salary ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much . I really had a good time .
__label__noemo	Tariff raises the price at which the goods are sold in the importing country and therefore makes them less competitive with locally produced goods .
__label__noemo	Not at all . I see you and your family twice a week , and I enjoy seeing my own friends . I ’ m too busy to feel lonely !
__label__joy	Let me enjoy it .
__label__noemo	No , Mary went first last time .
__label__joy	Sally ? She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains .

__label__joy	It's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz .

__label__noemo	Around seven .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry , sir , but it isn't . Your MasterCard or VISA will take care of things nicely .
__label__noemo	Thank you , sir .
__label__noemo	The new webpage design is much more effective than before . I feel confident it will rope in a lot more business because of its user-friendly format .
__label__noemo	I've already got a small pan . I need a big one .
__label__noemo	Well , I think you prepare it well and capture good savings , retiring early can give you a lot more time for travel and other activities , you should get out and enjoy the life you still can't , don't you think ?
__label__noemo	No , east is the other direction . To get to the Bakery , you need to turn around and go three blocks to Broadway . When you get to the intersection of Broadway and Elm , you hang a left . Go straight down that street for half a block and then you'll see the building on your left .
__label__noemo	Are there any good seats left ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I started this part-time job just three days ago . And my internship will last 1 week . I'm still a student now .

__label__noemo	Uh-oh ! I can't use Ethernet . My computer is wireless only .
__label__sadness	I ran my car into a tree yesterday and need to miss a few days of school .
__label__noemo	Then get an easier one , even if you earn less money . Which would you rather have , health or wealth ?
__label__noemo	They are a nice middle-aged couple , just like us .
__label__joy	Thanks , Daisy .
__label__noemo	Do you come here often , Laura ?
__label__noemo	Do you have any cheaper ones ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to , but I must run to a meeting .

__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__surprise	My Buddha ! ! It's beautiful ! But I thought you were afraid ?
__label__noemo	I know it is no good for my health if I am staying in the classroom all day . But how about my paper ?

__label__joy	You're right . Thank you for the advice .
__label__noemo	I need some info on car loans . Such as payment periods , interest rates , things like that , please .
__label__noemo	Okay . But our baby has fallen sleep .
__label__noemo	Well , I want to stay under $ 100 .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t know why I married him .
__label__noemo	No , thank you . She has big enough eyes as it is .
__label__noemo	That ’ s reasonable .
__label__noemo	Yes , I've got the address .
__label__noemo	By air or by sea ?
__label__noemo	It starts at 7:00 and lasts 3 hours .
__label__joy	That's perfect . I want to see one .
__label__noemo	Can you vouch for me that I was with you yesterday ?
__label__noemo	And what is it regarding please ?
__label__noemo	Then forgive her mistake .
__label__noemo	Did you see that ?
__label__noemo	Parker .
__label__noemo	Alright , then , with this chequing account you ’ ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book . Will you require overdraft protection ? There is an extra fee for that .
__label__joy	Yes ! Thank goodness you ’ re here.These bugs are driving us crazy !
__label__noemo	Organic ? What ’ s organic ? Do we need organic carrots ... ?
__label__noemo	Well , they don ’ t want to deal with people who look like that . They want people who look more like yourself .
__label__noemo	I like landscapes and still life . You prefer abstract paintings , don ’ t you ?
__label__disgust	Really ?
__label__noemo	Can you tell me the postal code for this building ?
__label__noemo	Must I catch a number 7 bus to get there ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s right . That ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species .
__label__noemo	It's just around the corner
__label__noemo	Yeah , it really is that simple.Every time there's a change in the items we do business on , you let me know . That's all you need to do .
__label__noemo	First I need to get your address . Try to move your arm as little as possible .
__label__noemo	That will be fine with me .
__label__noemo	Hey , wake up . It's done . How do you like it ?
__label__noemo	Duh ... That's the point . The people in the ads are wearing what's in . Plus , there are articles on new trends ...
__label__noemo	No problem . What floor ?
__label__noemo	Ask away .
__label__noemo	I suppose she did . Be quiet . There is a fish on the hook . Here it is . Look , a big one .
__label__noemo	Nine dollars and fifty cents .
__label__noemo	Exactly .
__label__joy	Wow ! That's a fantastic movie !
__label__joy	Why not ?
__label__joy	Sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ?
__label__noemo	Is it Fred's fault ?
__label__noemo	How long do you have to be there ?
__label__noemo	I think I have traits of both , actually . I look more like my mother .
__label__noemo	Please fill out this form , and what's in your package ?
__label__noemo	Why did the boss come down on Joe like a ton of bricks .
__label__noemo	What you need to do is apply for an amendment on your existing L / C .
__label__noemo	They are in the cupboard where you keep the gravy boat and serving dishes . Just be careful because the wine glasses are also there .
__label__noemo	How many people are there in your family ?
__label__noemo	Do we have any choices ?
__label__noemo	I can't open the door .
__label__joy	Thanks for saying so .
__label__noemo	Yes , but I don't like the story .
__label__noemo	I've never seen a machine like this before and need some help .
__label__surprise	That's outrageous ! I just don't understand why they're not on top of this .
__label__noemo	They can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more . that's because they rely on gadgets .
__label__noemo	That's a great attitude to have . I don't think you'll have any problems in the workforce .
__label__noemo	Yes , we do . How can I help ? I can give you a simple introduction , if you'd like ?
__label__noemo	Are you absolutely sure , Mr Zu ? You know , you will lose interest if you do .
__label__noemo	I'm glad we took the train . I don't like to ride in buses .
__label__noemo	It's a lovely day , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	sure , I am a total internet junkie , I can't survive without internet .
__label__noemo	How do you know ? You haven ’ t seen her since high school . I guess your evenings , whatever you do with them , are just too valuable .
__label__noemo	I want a chemise .
__label__noemo	OK . May I see your ID card ? ( B passed his ID card . ) Please wait for a moment . Let me go and check the account . ( A few minutes later . ) We have locked your card . You can come here to renew the account and get a new card a week later . Your money will not be lost .
__label__noemo	The traffic is terrible on Monday morning . It takes us almost 1 hour to get to school .
__label__noemo	What kind of intermediary is it ?
__label__noemo	Okay , here you are . ( She hands the completed form and the money to the clerk . )
__label__noemo	Yeah , this dress is really nice ! How much is it ?
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__noemo	That's not a problem . You can use that service wherever you are , it doesn't matter which country you are in at the time .
__label__noemo	Do they have ice cream bars . frozen yogurt or frozen chocolate mousse ?
__label__joy	She is so beautiful and elegant . And she is famous for her fine acting .
__label__noemo	We're going to give you a credit while the cable is down .
__label__joy	Nah ! It was cheap !
__label__noemo	Here you are , sir . What do I do next ?
__label__noemo	You mustn't touch the wet paint , Bill .
__label__noemo	It certainly is .
__label__noemo	Thanks doc !
__label__noemo	Sure . We can deliver it to your home .
__label__joy	Do you like swimming ?
__label__sadness	No , honey , the balcony is full of boxes and things . I'm sorry .
__label__noemo	Oh , ah , um the Nikon D60 is a nice option .
__label__noemo	Oh yeah ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s only seven miles . We turn left to join the motorway and drive south .
__label__noemo	She's not too tall .
__label__noemo	He ’ s 21 . how old is James ?
__label__noemo	OK , then , hope you feel better soon . Check your e-mail for missed assignments .
__label__noemo	I do agree with you .
__label__noemo	Well , what can I say ? I didn't know . Oh , I meant to tell you earlier , your blouse doesn't really match your skirt . Those colors don't really suit you either .
__label__surprise	Really ? Why not ? She looks great .
__label__noemo	She still loves him . That's why she feels upset . Her love is always hard and confusing ...
__label__joy	It was fun , I tell you .
__label__noemo	She's really tall . Do you know her ?
__label__noemo	You can put on your shades . And remember don't make your skin look like a tomato . Or else after that your skin will begin to flake off . You may even wind up with skin cancer .
__label__noemo	I also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . There was a problem last week .
__label__noemo	Sure , we provide semi-annual bonus , a small bonus at Spring Festival , four weeks paid vacation a year .
__label__noemo	All right , sir . You would receive dinner in about 15 minutes .
__label__noemo	How'd you miss it ?
__label__joy	that sounds great . Do you know if there are any vegetable dishes that are spicy ?
__label__joy	It's so interesting , I like it very much .
__label__noemo	yeah , Jenny and I got married right after graduation . It was tough the first years trying to make ends meet . I was supporting us both while she continued her studies . But now things are getting better
__label__surprise	Yeah ? All right . Thanks , Susan .
__label__noemo	I like classical music . Do you ?
__label__noemo	All right , sir.When are we supposed to be there ?
__label__surprise	You were scared , too ? I dared not tell you my feeling when I heard that . I almost got fainted .
__label__noemo	That stamp you've been looking for is for sale .
__label__noemo	Whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting !
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	yeah , I think so .
__label__noemo	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	Yes , will you keep our bags until 6 p . m . ?
__label__noemo	All right , if that would make you happy .
__label__noemo	So , are you going to quit driving to work then ?
__label__noemo	Definitely . I'm calling to tell you this .
__label__joy	Yes , we are match made in heaven .
__label__joy	Good-bye . See you again sometime .
__label__noemo	Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__noemo	Is it kept in hand now ?
__label__noemo	Yeah . They are emitted directly into urban water supplies .
__label__noemo	Very good . What was your favorite subject in middle school ?
__label__noemo	Didn't you notice all the roses ?
__label__noemo	You need a holiday.That ' s what's the matter .
__label__joy	OK , just ignore him . I've noticed there are lots of exercise facilities in our community . After dinner you can go there for a walk with your family !
__label__noemo	No , I don't have a ride yet .
__label__joy	I hope you will like it .
__label__noemo	It ’ s nearly half past seven .
__label__joy	Yeah . Thanks for the talk .
__label__sadness	Yeah , I'm very nauseous . It's mostly nausea and a fever .
__label__noemo	How about doing shopping this weekend ?
__label__noemo	Where can I take it ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I'm looking for a cap . Size 16 .
__label__noemo	Don't worry about that . I have already calculated the money about things you will buy . Remember to give me the receipt when you come back .
__label__noemo	Yes , that ’ s right . I do speak decent Japanese .
__label__noemo	I hope we don't have any more blackouts .
__label__noemo	Yes , it is . You describe someone we both know .
__label__noemo	She means business , for sure .
__label__noemo	We should particularly pay attention to acknowledgments in the interview .
__label__joy	It was nice to meet you , too . And thanks for coming in today .
__label__noemo	I know , but I'm hungry again .
__label__anger	Who knows ! That might come to later .
__label__noemo	Z3264356 .
__label__noemo	OK . Here you are .
__label__noemo	That's right .
__label__noemo	For 6 months we can offer you 0.59 % .
__label__noemo	Hi ! How are you doing ?
__label__noemo	Would you show me some table-cloths ?
__label__noemo	How long will it take ? Could you repair them while I wait ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I want to make a plane reservation to Shanghai , China .
__label__noemo	How do I log on to the computer ?
__label__noemo	And may I suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ?
__label__noemo	We have this beautiful platinum pendant , or you could also get her a locket . You could also get her a timepiece — it ’ s both glamorous yet functional.If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend , maybe I can help you find something for her .
__label__noemo	It doesn't fit quite right . It feels a little tight in the waist . Do you have this in a larger size ?
__label__noemo	No , he's retired .
__label__joy	It's very nice . I like it very much .
__label__noemo	I major in Chemistry .
__label__noemo	terrorist acts are deliberate and deadly and can affect every walk of life .
__label__noemo	Yep , it should be here by tomorrow night .
__label__noemo	This is awkward , I know . I know you're upset . But in two weeks you'll be thanking me .
__label__noemo	Then what shall we do ?
__label__noemo	Isn't “ frappuccino ” Italian , too ? ... and heat me up a panini .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , can you tell me the name of the book you read ?
__label__noemo	Sure , go ahead .
__label__noemo	That's fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ?
__label__sadness	I'm afraid he is not in at the moment .
__label__noemo	I can do that . And I would like to make dumplings later .
__label__noemo	What colors do you have in foundation ?
__label__noemo	How far is that ?
__label__noemo	I'm from Germany .
__label__noemo	And as for the kitchen things , do you want very high quality ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to order room service to room 202 , please ,
__label__noemo	Are you ready to order ?
__label__noemo	What would the roses cost me ?
__label__noemo	Great ! I ’ ll take it .
__label__noemo	Only 3 % ? That's not much . If you could make some concessions , we would probably buy some of your other products .
__label__noemo	Of course , madam .
__label__noemo	A slow sparrow should make an early start . You know , I am not quick at learning any language .
__label__joy	Let's kick off our shoes to walk on the green flag stoned roads .
__label__noemo	I hope she ’ ll recover soon .
__label__fear	It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .
__label__noemo	It's true . I would never go there again either.Country music is a nightmare . So is it the Latin Club ?
__label__noemo	Maybe . But the car of this space has a broken rearview mirror on the left .
__label__noemo	Anything strange about that ?
__label__noemo	It's mild , but it's not always pleasant.The weather's often cold in the North and windy in the East . It's often wet in the West and sometimes warm in the South .
__label__noemo	It's only $ 20 .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'd like another cup of coffee afterwards . Make it hot , please .
__label__noemo	Yes . That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework .
__label__noemo	How about some Zongzi ?
__label__noemo	Thirty minutes , that will be all right . There are still fifty minutes to go before the library is open . Look , what are they doing on the square ?
__label__noemo	What ’ s the difference between this and other Churches ?
__label__fear	But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ?
__label__noemo	now I see , you must be suffering from discomgoogolation .
__label__noemo	It's good . By the way , what kind of clothes do I have to bring with me ?
__label__joy	Bingo !
__label__noemo	Let's do that .
__label__joy	That sounds like a plan .
__label__noemo	Yes , you are changed 50 cents a piece .
__label__noemo	Not really . I did some research about Chinese table manners . The important rule is to remain silent while eating . Of course , this refers to family meals only . Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health . It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party . The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated . Each dish should be placed in the correct position . When fish is served , the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty . If it is in winter , the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter . Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table . The diners should sit close to the table so food won ’ t drop on their cloths . No noise should be made when chewing . No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn ’ t like it . One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise . All these table manners are very similar to Western habits .
__label__noemo	Nah , it's a place where homelesspeople go to eat .
__label__noemo	Are you kidding ? Don had fun scaring you . He'd probably buy you dinner if we go back .
__label__joy	Hi , Tina , I've got good news . I have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with ABC Company . They informed me to go to the final round next Monday . It looks very promising .
__label__noemo	Your main duty is to answer the phone calls and transfer them to the person wanted .
__label__noemo	Good evening .
__label__noemo	Oh , God . It ’ s late . I ’ m afraid I have to leave .
__label__noemo	Very good ! It pumps blood throughout the body , using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins . Now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive ! Now what about the organs that help us digest food ?
__label__noemo	I want you to vacuum in your room , and don't forget to dust everything .
__label__noemo	What do you think of it ?
__label__noemo	What's your parents ' opinion ?
__label__noemo	yes . Does the checking account come with a debit card ?
__label__noemo	I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know , but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ?
__label__noemo	We have half-hour and one-hour treatments .
__label__noemo	That is a long line .
__label__noemo	Really ? We began to load the goods after we made sure they were qualified .
__label__noemo	Hello ! I'd like to reconfirm my flight reservation .
__label__noemo	In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .
__label__noemo	How much is it ?
__label__noemo	Well , it still hasn ’ t reached its destination . I wonder if you could track it down for us . Mr . Reynolds is a bit concerned .
__label__noemo	I think we should accept his plan .
__label__joy	Wow , what a cool car ! The styling of this car really appeals to me .
__label__noemo	This model is very popular with ladies .
__label__noemo	Hello , is that the Peace Restaurant ?
__label__noemo	You can say that again . The government must open it ’ s eyes to the fact .
__label__noemo	Six and a quarter , I believe , but you'd better measure my hand to make sure .
__label__noemo	I want to save some US dollars into my account .
__label__joy	I'll go take a look . Thanks for your help .
__label__noemo	Sorry , sir . It's not allowed in our hotel .
__label__noemo	Do you want to get a promotion ?
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Could I see that , please ?
__label__joy	That's fine .
__label__noemo	Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it .
__label__noemo	No , sir . Would you rather sit near the dance floor ?
__label__joy	well , yesterday , I decided to face my fear of heights .
__label__noemo	Yes , I will be able to make it then .
__label__joy	That sounds good . Which one do you recommend ?
__label__noemo	How long did the meeting last ?
__label__noemo	that ’ s another quid .
__label__noemo	New York Times is better ?
__label__noemo	No problem . Did you bring any gifts back for your department ?
__label__noemo	All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ?
__label__noemo	What about this ?
__label__joy	Cool ! What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer , free sketch or claborate-style painting ?
__label__noemo	Impossible . My pager is really old . It doesn't display messages .
__label__noemo	well , if you want to live in London , you have to pay the price !
__label__noemo	What kind of room would you like ?
__label__noemo	Ah ! Does she wear glasses ?
__label__noemo	Alright , sir .
__label__noemo	Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .
__label__noemo	Oh , that ’ s alright .
__label__noemo	As a matter of fact , I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts . I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country .
__label__surprise	But I'm going on a business trip in two days !
__label__noemo	I'm working as an export sales staff member for a trade company .
__label__joy	Oh yes , I know which one you mean . I have never been there , but I looked at their menu once and it did look good .
__label__noemo	Welcome ! Welcome to Little Italy . We're the most Italian family here !
__label__joy	Sure , I love curry . Who else is coming ?
__label__noemo	Yes , we do.My parents prepare dinner for me .
__label__noemo	Yes it is , but you ’ ll have to discuss the details with your manager .
__label__noemo	We should take a packed lunch on the journey.The food they sell on the trains is always expensive .
__label__noemo	Oh , he wants to practice his language skills , too .
__label__noemo	Well then , what are your spoils ?
__label__noemo	That's fine too .
__label__sadness	This is a pity !
__label__noemo	Hello ? This is John Smith.Can I speak to Mr.White , please ?
__label__joy	That would be lovely , thanks .
__label__noemo	It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now .
__label__noemo	No . My friend did .
__label__noemo	Oh , the telephone lines were damaged by the storm . They repaired them yesterday .
__label__joy	that sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ?
__label__noemo	What was that ?
__label__noemo	Look ! The iron is still on .
__label__noemo	Five keys and a small foot ornament .
__label__noemo	it's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through
__label__noemo	So , which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
__label__noemo	A tow truck was towing my car and put all those dents in my car .
__label__noemo	Are you serious ? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! It disgusts me .
__label__noemo	Yes , please . My telephone number is 367 - 1314 . You can call me between four and six in the afternoon .
__label__joy	I want to have a foot massage and haircut .
__label__noemo	Just a little steak , uh ... snack ? A bowl of clam chowder ?
__label__noemo	I am fully satisfied with the terms of this contract .
__label__noemo	What ’ s up ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , that was close .
__label__noemo	Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ?
__label__noemo	So you guys should be always busy .
__label__noemo	You ’ re supposed to clean your teeth before you go to bed .
__label__noemo	I understand , Mr . Carmichael . I ’ d be glad to make it some time next week .
__label__joy	You deserve credit , too . I've learned so much from You .
__label__noemo	The only thing you'll have to pay for is the monthly sticker .
__label__noemo	Good-bye .
__label__noemo	Hi , how ’ re you doing ?
__label__noemo	This is Sue from work .
__label__noemo	But , sir , I didn't drink at all .
__label__noemo	Oh , the car is old but still in good condition . I just think we should be thrifty , whether you are rich or not .
__label__noemo	Thank you . Remember to look me up if you ’ re ever in Washington .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__noemo	I don't want to lose all my money .
__label__surprise	Really ? In New Berlin ?
__label__noemo	I do , but I want meat .
__label__noemo	No ! Five minutes I promise !
__label__noemo	Do you have an airsickness ?
__label__joy	That sounds just wonderful to us .
__label__noemo	Do you have ID ?
__label__noemo	Yes , this is Jin Lili . What can I do for you
__label__noemo	I said I am informing you of the interview .
__label__noemo	So ? You can go to the class for me.Just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . Why not ?
__label__noemo	Sure , speak to you later . It isn ’ t urgent . Maybe it is easier if I send you an e-mail .
__label__noemo	They are in aisle 5 .
__label__noemo	Thank you , Mr . Johnson .
__label__noemo	The doctor has an opening at 10:30 tomorrow . I'll put you down for then .
__label__noemo	You'll have to pay 20 RIB , and then you will have your Southern Fund Management company card .
__label__noemo	Type ? I don't know , what do you have ?
__label__joy	Sure , it is 80 yuan in all and you have to give me another coupon .
__label__noemo	I'd be willing to try this hotel again , if you can promise me no more cockroaches .
__label__joy	I ’ m sure he will be .
__label__noemo	Watch your language .
__label__noemo	You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
__label__joy	that's true . She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company .
__label__noemo	The cable should be running again in a couple of days .
__label__noemo	It includes your air fare , your hotel accommodations and the meals .
__label__noemo	What about her facial features ?
__label__noemo	Do you think you can speak English quite fluently ? Tell me about your English education .
__label__noemo	I am afraid we can not do that . Would you be willing to sign an annual contract on the basis we discussed ?
__label__noemo	... Okay , I'm through . Here's the form and my old card .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	I like it . It's a beautiful country .
__label__joy	I think you'll love this pan . Do you want to pay with cash ?
__label__joy	Well , you made a good choice . Coming to us , I mean.We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
__label__noemo	the heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer !
__label__noemo	why ? You have a decent salary , lots of promotion opportunities and a regular life of going to the office at 9 o ' clock and coming back home at 5 in the evening .
__label__noemo	These three hours chatting with you have been very ... interesting . Could you please tell us why we're here ?
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__joy	Yeah , they all received very strict training . A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice .
__label__noemo	Fine , it's the thing for me . I will take it .
__label__joy	I'm glad these batteries are on sale .
__label__sadness	Good heavens , am I really ? I'm so sorry , I didn't notice .
__label__noemo	Business management
__label__joy	This isn't like you ... Well , I hope you will have a nice flight and a successful start in business .
__label__surprise	pardon ?
__label__noemo	Oh , did he ?
__label__noemo	I want to have a trip to Sydney .
__label__noemo	Do you want to pick them up or should we deliver them ?
__label__noemo	A checkup . I think I have a bad cavity . Half the side of my head hurts .
__label__noemo	I realize that .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t agree , but anyways , I think you should start thinking of a new year ’ s resolution yourself .
__label__noemo	It's bulldog 123 .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes , if you like.The large one goes to Washington.The other one I will take with me . All right ?
__label__noemo	Well , I have been in the computer engineering field for 6 years now . I am familiar with both hardware and software and with hands-on experience in system development including system analysis and design .
__label__noemo	Well , the state will benefit a lot , I suppose .
__label__joy	It was a pleasure , Mrs . Robinson .
__label__noemo	Will you need anything special for the presentation ?
__label__noemo	I was wondering if I could collect unemployment benefits .
__label__noemo	Maybe it was Dick .
__label__noemo	Seemingly there is no turning back . I have to face it somehow .
__label__noemo	That's OK . But you'd better take an additional course in some English schools .
__label__noemo	Yeah , but it isn't more expensive than international calls .
__label__noemo	No , I was out . Was it worth watching ?
__label__noemo	Just a moment , I'll look up the rate for air-mail letters to South America .
__label__noemo	You are not being a good sport about this .
__label__noemo	Ok . Anything else ?
__label__joy	It sure is . I'm glad it didn't rain . My name's Mike Gates , by the way .
__label__noemo	Hello , may I help you ?
__label__noemo	We can go to the cinema or say at home watching TV , what's it to be ?
__label__noemo	Yeah ! He is a nice guy . He is very helpful and always bends over backward to help those who are in need of help .
__label__noemo	Yeah , but have you made an appointment ahead ?
__label__noemo	For members , there is a small transaction charge , but it ’ s only 5 dollars per transaction . Any particular denomination ?
__label__noemo	We are checking in . May I have your ticket ? And your health certificate and your luggage , please .
__label__disgust	I really hate this weather .
__label__joy	Oh it ’ s printed the ticket already . Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	They're smoking pot . Don't worry about it .
__label__noemo	What kind of character do you think you have ?
__label__noemo	Not today . Thanks though .
__label__surprise	You are shopping for a pillow online ? That ’ s absurd !
__label__noemo	This historian is famous in the field of Tang Dynasty .
__label__noemo	Stirred or shaken ?
__label__noemo	I really need to get some things before I leave .
__label__noemo	Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .
__label__noemo	I'm a quick leamer , Mr.Jenkins .
__label__noemo	Hi . I ’ m here for flight 514 returning to Beijing but the board shows there is a delay.How long of a delay is expected ?
__label__noemo	I left a suitcase on the train to London the other day .
__label__noemo	I'd hate for you to think I was lazy in returning your money .
__label__noemo	Water is rationed . We can only use a certain amount each month . It means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . They use too much water .
__label__noemo	Let me see . How much should I pay for you ?
__label__noemo	There are two of us , but we only need a one-bedroom apartment .
__label__joy	You are the one I should thank . You've done really great job .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	What do you mean ?
__label__noemo	How long have you had that problem ?
__label__noemo	It's going to be sunny tomorrow .
__label__noemo	I went to Harvard University .
__label__noemo	Take care and give my best to your parents .
__label__joy	It will be ready right away .
__label__noemo	Yes , I see . We will cancel your order .
__label__surprise	When ?
__label__noemo	This visit is over for me . Here's your room key .
__label__noemo	$ 250 . It's Sony made in Japan .
__label__joy	Sure . I ’ Ve never seen a dragon boat race .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	maybe not , but my iron was getting old . In fact , it stopped working the week after jim bought me the new one . It ’ s as if he knew that my old iron would soon stop working !
__label__noemo	During the weekend I often take the family out on short trips .
__label__noemo	Peter , it's time to go home now ! Hurry up !
__label__noemo	we can buy a three-liter bottle . It works out cheaper per liter . We should buy a packet of butter and a few pints of milk too .
__label__noemo	Thanks . OK ... your balance is 320,214 RIB . How much do you require today ?
__label__noemo	Thank you for taking my word over the computer's word .
__label__anger	I got the message . I am quitting .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid so . I don't remember you telling me about it .
__label__noemo	What is your career objective ?
__label__noemo	Mao Tai and Qingdao Beer .
__label__noemo	No , he's still sleeping .
__label__noemo	I'm not sure , you know I'm not familiar with the city , too .
__label__noemo	The paper editorials always stick to the quick .
__label__noemo	My stomach feels so empty .
__label__noemo	Yes , you passed .
__label__noemo	Are you feeling better now ? Do you need some pills ?
__label__noemo	Let me see.En .. it's right now.You can try it .
__label__noemo	That was quick ! I didn't expect it to come through so quickly . Yes , that is good news . The full amount should be 20,000 Euros , is that right ? I'd like to withdraw 5,000 Euros worth of local currency , if that's possible .
__label__noemo	Sure . My number is 545-8897 , and I live at 908 Mulbury Street .
__label__noemo	Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ?
__label__noemo	No .
__label__noemo	It sounds very complicated . How far is it from here ?
__label__surprise	Are you kidding ? The Yen is in worse shape than the Dollar !
__label__noemo	Yes , I will . But can you tell me how to get to the consulting room ?
__label__joy	That ’ s great , because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves . I prefer natural remedies to man-made ones .
__label__sadness	It seems so strange to be here , burying you , but it's not you .
__label__surprise	Are you serious ?
__label__noemo	Would you like a shampoo first ?
__label__noemo	I have a resume here .
__label__joy	Sounds good ! I have always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food .
__label__noemo	That's a problem facing many young families nowadays , and we are sympathetic to the problem . That's why we have just started a new scheme ; a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan .
__label__noemo	Is there anything else ?
__label__noemo	I want my appliances to be delivered as we are moving into the house .
__label__noemo	What are you going to do to it ?
__label__noemo	Do you have any seat preferences , sir ?
__label__noemo	This is Bill Burton from Milford Insurance , I'm calling in regards to our meeting next Tuesday .
__label__noemo	Shave also , s ir ?
__label__joy	Yes , it has been a long time since we have seen you .
__label__joy	With the development of the broad band Internet , you can easily upload your video files to websites or e-mail them to relatives or business partners .
__label__noemo	Hi , Lilly , it ’ s so nice to see you again .
__label__noemo	Definitely .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t think so . I think cats are sweet .
__label__joy	how about this blue sweater ?
__label__noemo	You can ! With a little practice .
__label__noemo	What is the fare ?
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__noemo	Here you are . I'm here on business and this is from my boss , it's for my expenses so I need cash .
__label__noemo	I see . I will try my best to do the job well .
__label__noemo	Yes , but you will need to send us proof of their mistake .
__label__noemo	The more you work , the more you earn .
__label__noemo	Can you see that road side help ?
__label__noemo	Medical department ? Are you sure ?
__label__noemo	What makes you say that ?
__label__noemo	No , we met at university .
__label__noemo	What are the things that are forbidden to take in departure ?
__label__joy	That sounds fairly simple , but how do I cook it ?
__label__joy	Sounds great . Thank you for your hospitality .
__label__noemo	didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .
__label__noemo	How can I tell if they're ripe ?
__label__noemo	Where would you like him to come ?
__label__noemo	Exercise has no benefit unless you sweat like a pig .
__label__noemo	Do you have small bills ?
__label__joy	not bad , any other ideas ?
__label__noemo	Well , look at our aluminum pan . It's much lighter .
__label__joy	Eleven o'clock on Friday morning . See you then .
__label__noemo	I'm looking for the produce section , please .
__label__noemo	Hey , Chillon , I'm just trying to help .
__label__joy	why not ? I would like to buy some candies . Since there are so many people , I think they must have delicious candy .
__label__noemo	Oh , hello , Lucy . What's up ?
__label__noemo	Do you think she'd like a laptop ?
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__noemo	Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
__label__joy	That sounds great . I'll take them .
__label__joy	That's fine .
__label__noemo	Come on in . Let me show you around . Here ’ s the living room .
__label__noemo	Let's line up here . This line seems a little shorter .
__label__noemo	Yes , well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details I ’ d like to clarify .
__label__noemo	I'm here to help . Tell me your questions and I'll do my best to answer them .
__label__noemo	I'm coming back on the 17th .
__label__noemo	That happens in many places . In my city , there is a very good drug rehabilitation programme . The police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes , but I don ’ t know if that ’ s the reason for
__label__noemo	No , I need my books .
__label__noemo	Do you know your credit score ?
__label__noemo	No.If you can't break it , keep the change.But can you give me a receipt ?
__label__noemo	I'm quite active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like to leave things half-done .
__label__noemo	Order tea . Isn't that what you like to drink ?
__label__joy	It's time to go . Bye , Ella . Hope to see you soon
__label__noemo	Look at the swiss roll over there , they look delicious , too , I am thinking about buying one .
__label__noemo	Ok , good luck to you .
__label__noemo	What ?
__label__noemo	Suppose you have to do one of the two , which do you prefer ?
__label__noemo	I'm absolutely lovely , thank you .
__label__noemo	All I want is the same thing on this card .
__label__noemo	What do you mean ?
__label__noemo	There you are . As you can see , the maturity isn't up yet .
__label__noemo	I bought it in a store near my school .
__label__noemo	Hello.this is Susan .
__label__noemo	I don't need to drink every weekend . I could be happy just staying home , you know .
__label__noemo	OK . Here .
__label__joy	Great ! Uh , remember that there's a gift exchange , too . We all have to bring a gift .
__label__noemo	Oh , good . Irene , can you tell me why you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant ? Don't you like your present job ?
__label__noemo	Good afternoon , sir , is there anything I can help you with today ?
__label__noemo	I don't know .
__label__surprise	Do you have hypertension ? I would have thought you were too young .
__label__noemo	I booked a table yesterday .
__label__noemo	Hello . Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	If everyone turned up , it would be a squeeze . But a few people said that they couldn ’ t go . So I think it should be OK ?
__label__noemo	I ’ ll see you then . Good bye .
__label__noemo	Sure , I've had the steak and the lobster before . They're both very good .
__label__noemo	My washing machine broke down .
__label__noemo	Do you think it's a good option for health and relaxation ?
__label__noemo	I had no idea .
__label__noemo	I'm just fishing from the shore . How about you ?
__label__noemo	Is it just a bus ?
__label__noemo	I haven't heard anything about it .
__label__noemo	How about tomorrow night ?
__label__noemo	Do you have a hotel card or something ?
__label__noemo	May I have your name and phone number , please ?
__label__noemo	Her name is Laura , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	Do you get angry easily ?
__label__noemo	Not today , thanks . But I'd like to know any of the vegetarian dishes .
__label__noemo	I don't know how to do it .
__label__noemo	When should I come for work in the morning ?
__label__surprise	You do ?
__label__disgust	That woman is a thorough drag !
__label__noemo	Well , no surprise there .
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve researched the company and think I ’ m perfect for the job but I ’ m not sure how to get it across to them .
__label__noemo	Oh , sorry to hear that . But , don worry ! Taiwan has plenty of great things to eat . First , lets get you to the hotel .
__label__noemo	May I have your room number , sir ?
__label__noemo	Is there any difference ?
__label__noemo	But anyhow there are many worthwhile programs .
__label__noemo	OK . Here you are .
__label__noemo	Yes , I think so .
__label__noemo	The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm .
__label__noemo	Welcome . My name is Johnson .
__label__noemo	How long is it ?
__label__noemo	Wow , like America . It receives a great number of visitors every year .
__label__noemo	Sure , if you would like one of those tables , I could seat you right away .
__label__noemo	You may tell me both , Ma'am .
__label__surprise	You can't be serious .
__label__noemo	Whatever . Just make sure you go vote .
__label__noemo	I guess he gets that from me , I never did well in math when I was a kid . What can I do at home to compliment what he is learning in the classroom .
__label__noemo	I'd like to reconfirm my plane reservation .
__label__noemo	Time sure flies , doesn't it ?
__label__joy	Great ! I went hiking in the mountains on Saturday .
__label__noemo	Hello . Is my laundry ready ? My room number is 210 .
__label__joy	Yes . Why ?
__label__noemo	If I were you , I would take a few days to take care of those things before you move in .
__label__noemo	Hi , Ben . Here are the top ten of this week's top chart .
__label__noemo	OK . How much is it all together ?
__label__noemo	He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ?
__label__joy	You ’ re all set now ?
__label__noemo	En ?
__label__noemo	Which is more interesting to you , flying kites or going roller-skating ?
__label__noemo	Yup.Hey , do you want to see a picture ? See , he's eating lunch .
__label__noemo	That's exactly what happened ! He kept interrupting everyone with his own suggestions and did not want to hear what others had to say . Then he expected everyone to agree with him .
__label__noemo	What is your favorite coffee ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes . There is a big one at the right corner of the street . Perhaps you will get one there .
__label__noemo	I guess so .
__label__noemo	OK . Here you are .
__label__noemo	Yes , we are travelling at rush hours . It could be very crowded in the morning and after 6 o'clock in the afternoon .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I guess I should .
__label__noemo	Too bad I missed it .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll just cancel your account right now .
__label__disgust	You shouldn't let the dirty dishes accumulate in the sink !
__label__joy	Are you doing anything tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
__label__noemo	Oh , you're staying at the downtown Hilton.Then , you go down two blocks this way and turn left.You ' ll find it on the right .
__label__noemo	When she first walked into the room to greet us , she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all . I thought that was a bit unprofessional .
__label__joy	Well , you can't compare a small balcony to this large veranda . This is perfect for having a barbecue in summer .
__label__noemo	Can I stay out all night with my friends ?
__label__noemo	Sorry , sir . Dinners are available 20 minutes , drinks are served throughout the flight .
__label__noemo	Maybe ...
__label__noemo	I can speak French and German .
__label__noemo	Mothers like that .
__label__joy	Great . We can chat while enjoying a cup there .
__label__noemo	Well , I ’ m from Chicago . There few people take the time to get to know their neighbors .
__label__noemo	My stomach hurts , Doctor .
__label__joy	Hand me some globes and paper flowers , I'll put them on these top branches .
__label__noemo	It's where I teach you Chinese , and in exchange you teach me English .
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry , sir . Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage , at twenty kilograms each , plus one piece of carry-on luggage . I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase .
__label__noemo	Ok , that would be very nice ! What do I need to do to transfer ?
__label__noemo	My English isn't very good . I didn't know what to say to them .
__label__noemo	Remember that I will only let you miss one class meeting per semester .
__label__noemo	No , I'm not .
__label__noemo	Have you ever been a student cadre ?
__label__noemo	Really ? What can I do ?
__label__noemo	It's very hot , the temperature is often over 40 ° C .
__label__noemo	three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive !
__label__joy	It's perfect ! It's a Dilbert tie !
__label__noemo	Oh , it ’ s been uh ... fifteen minutes .
__label__noemo	Maybe .
__label__noemo	Are we going all out or just starting with a mini family vacation ?
__label__joy	That's OK with me .
__label__noemo	What ’ s to get ready ?
__label__noemo	Did you eat any ice cream ?
__label__joy	That ’ s good . I ’ d like to see it .
__label__anger	Yes ! Thank goodness you ’ re here.These bugs are driving us crazy !
__label__noemo	Yes . please .
__label__noemo	He is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor .
__label__noemo	Well , I don ’ t mean to boast but all the designs are done by myself and some colleagues are already trying to copy some of them for their new apartments . Look , they are making photos now of my designed kitchen .
__label__noemo	I'm terribly sorry I'm late . I just couldn't help it .
__label__noemo	You are welcome to have a try . Here it is . Ours is of prime quality .
__label__joy	I am really excited for you .
__label__noemo	It works if you keep at it . Come on , let's go !
__label__noemo	Well , I can't find the way to the entrance . Would you tell me where the entrance is ?
__label__noemo	Maybe you ’ re right .
__label__noemo	Via Kiang . I'd like to leave on May 5th .
__label__fear	Oh , how dreadful ! I ’ m ever so sorry .
__label__noemo	I don't really know for sure yet . I'll tell you after the test on Friday .
__label__noemo	While you should not omit your weak points , they need to be described appropriately
__label__joy	It is . I hope you ’ ll have time to come for a visit soon . You really should come during the summer , when the weather is better and there ’ s more happening outdoors .
__label__noemo	Hi , Steven . You have finished a wonderful project recently .
__label__noemo	Yes . I want a first class single ticket .
__label__noemo	Yes , I know . But it can't be helped . It's been a pretty slow month and I just don't have enough cash to refurnish the whole house .
__label__surprise	not a single email until now ? it's already twelve o'clock . I can't believe it !
__label__noemo	Welcome to the International Business Department . How can I help you ?
__label__noemo	We have the orientation this afternoon .
__label__noemo	I want to change my hairstyle . What would you suggest ?
__label__joy	Can I read it when you ’ re done ?
__label__noemo	How long has your daughter been in the States ?
__label__noemo	Mandarin is the language I spoke since I was a child . So I can speak it very fluently .
__label__noemo	Boots
__label__joy	It looks pretty good . I think I'll take it .
__label__noemo	Er ... no , go ahead .
__label__noemo	Not much . Joann . Do you want to hang out ?
__label__noemo	For six months , please .
__label__noemo	What does she look like ?
__label__noemo	Leave the cup in the cubby in the restroom . Just close the cubby door and walk away .
__label__noemo	Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut .
__label__noemo	yes , we are . obviously , we'd like something as cheap as possible . we've heard that there are places for 80 to 100 pounds a month .
__label__joy	People are very kind down your way . You ’ re lucky .
__label__joy	Oh , you're lucky , there are just two tickets left . Do you want to take them ?
__label__joy	Just a club soda for me , please .
__label__noemo	Certainly.here you are .
__label__joy	Sounds good ! Let's go !
__label__noemo	The kitchen god ? What does he do ?
__label__noemo	Sorry , could you tell me your name ?
__label__noemo	No problem , I ’ ll take those . Sir , these coupons expired yesterday .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__noemo	Time is flying . I still remember everything when he was a child .
__label__noemo	And have you taken anything for it ?
__label__joy	thanks . You ’ d be ok on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ?
__label__joy	Sure . What time would you like to come ?
__label__joy	Oh , yes . The ski slopes are well lit . It's really nice to ski at night . Why don't you learn to ski ?
__label__noemo	That's no problem . The amount is 2,000 RIB , is that correct ?
__label__noemo	The antiques market here in Paris is very famous . It's called Le marche aux puces de Saint-Ouen .
__label__noemo	I'm going to do some shopping.Why don't you come with me ?
__label__noemo	Oh , what does it say ? Does it say water could still exist under the surface of Mars ?
__label__noemo	Why do you hate to go outside ?
__label__noemo	that ’ s good advice , but I ’ m not confident that even revised proposals will be accepted .
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? What do you do there exactly ?
__label__noemo	What is a sixties party ?
__label__joy	Yes . That would be nice . When do you want to go ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	That sounds smart ... but kind of boring .
__label__noemo	May I have two tickets for Tiny Times ?
__label__noemo	Will the trousers shrink when washed ?
__label__noemo	not yet .
__label__joy	Well ... How about Friday then ?
__label__noemo	I was born on January 1st , 1988 . I ’ m 20 years old now .
__label__noemo	Will you have time this Saturday evening to go to the cinema with me ?
__label__noemo	Certainly . May I have your name , please ?
__label__noemo	That's what I thought . It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months .
__label__anger	For crying out loud ... How fast are we losing money ?
__label__noemo	It's very kind of you . By the way , when does the pool close ?
__label__noemo	No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
__label__noemo	Then , turn on the lamp , please .
__label__noemo	He is finishing up a special continue education program for executives . He can continue working , taking a few of classes here and there , and in 2 years he will complete his MBA .
__label__noemo	You can see your results and how they compare to the normal range .
__label__noemo	This one suits better . I will take it .
__label__noemo	We should certainly hold a big party for the professors and students . We could have a firework display .
__label__noemo	Well , as you know , on November 11th the allies signed a peace treaty with the Germans , also known as the Armistice Treaty . This marked the end of WWI and many countries around the world commemorate this date under names such as Remembers ’ Day . In Poland it ’ s their independence day ! There ’ s a lot going on around the world on this day .
__label__noemo	To me English is a difficult language .
__label__noemo	I wish I could , but It ’ s already late .
__label__noemo	Now , we're going to draw an apple in your sketch book . What do we use ?
__label__noemo	Medium .
__label__noemo	Jane's mother always wants her to marry a big shot . J
__label__noemo	When can I know whether I am accepted or not ?
__label__noemo	Well . You ’ re here .
__label__sadness	I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday .
__label__surprise	It's very easy . Here it is . Ready ? Excellent ! You are a good singer . You sing the bass so well .
__label__noemo	I believe industry is making us wealthier .
__label__noemo	I was thinking we should just go to the cafeteria .
__label__anger	You can't do that ! You can't charge me for a mistake that you made !
__label__noemo	That ’ s one of the conditions of my policy too . It covers you if you die before you retire and when you retire .
__label__noemo	We offer a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . The application process is pretty straight forward . I trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ?
__label__joy	Yes , I'd appreciate it if you could drive me downtown .
__label__noemo	They give you discounts on some stuff that you want to buy .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , professor . I need to go home now .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__noemo	I want to go to Shanghai , but I also want to visit Hainan .
__label__noemo	No , I haven't .
__label__noemo	How do you do ?
__label__noemo	Pan American Airlines . Flight 282 .
__label__noemo	The price is on the tag . How would you like to pay ?
__label__joy	Sure . Will you be long ?
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__anger	Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant .
__label__noemo	This morning . I mean ...
__label__anger	Yes , but you might have told me before .
__label__noemo	I think money will make me happy .
__label__noemo	What's it like ?
__label__noemo	I'm going to America .
__label__noemo	Ok , I ’ Ve entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen . I guess I just choose which service I want , don ’ t I ?
__label__noemo	Right , let me run through your options . You can go ahead and cash your undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate if you really want to , but I'd recommend a Personal Durable Commodities Loan .
__label__noemo	Hello , is this People's Theater ?
__label__noemo	Are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift ?
__label__noemo	Good evening , miss . Want some socks ?
__label__noemo	Well ... guess how low the bidding starts on the tennis racket ?
__label__noemo	An apartment ? Why ?
__label__noemo	Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO ’ s with low co-pays and good coverage . The deductibles are low , too .
__label__noemo	Yes , the couple that I highlighted at today's show met on Match.com and they're getting married this summer .
__label__noemo	Any rain ?
__label__noemo	That is good of you to say so.When can you start working ?
__label__noemo	Done ! What else should I do ?
__label__noemo	How long do you want to sign a contract for ?
__label__noemo	How much ?
__label__noemo	The final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade ; homework , attendance , and quizzes total 60 percent .
__label__noemo	That sounds like my cat . She likes to scratch the couch with her claws .
__label__noemo	Have you heard about the robbery ?
__label__joy	Thank you.But I will call her later
__label__noemo	I have studied carefully the information about your company on the internet and I have checked your company ’ s homepage . I am impressed by the company . And I like the products a lot . Since you ’ re growing steadily , I would be very eager to help you to improve your accounting system .
__label__noemo	Yes , I do .
__label__noemo	Good evening , sir . What can I do for you ?
__label__joy	OK . Can I have your phone number ?
__label__sadness	Just a moment , sir . Let me check the reservation list . Sorry , I'm afraid we're fully booked tonight . Would you like to make a reservation some other time ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s not high enough .
__label__noemo	She's terribly sorry about that . She had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week . She hopes you understand .
__label__noemo	Do you need anything else ?
__label__noemo	He has a mustache , if I remember correctly , and a light complexion .
__label__noemo	you have to be realistic . Not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion .
__label__noemo	Yes , your wife and your dentist called .
__label__noemo	Yes , there are . They are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
__label__noemo	Sure . Do you want to have the car washed ?
__label__noemo	It ′ s a state-of-the-art piece of equipment , sir . With a gigantic 16.1 USGA TFT screen , 2.8 Ghz mobile processor , generous 512 MB RAM , removable 80 GB hard drive , convenient CD-RW / DVD combo drive , stunning fast graphics board with 64 MB DDR DRAM , dual battery capability , integrated Fast Ethernet card , IEEE 1394 digital interface and eight USB ports , it has all the power of a desktop computer packed into an ultra-slim notebook !
__label__noemo	It's hard to say , I like interesting and significant ones . I don't care whether they're blockbusters or not .
__label__noemo	Ok , tell me .
__label__anger	He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .
__label__noemo	I received my new card this morning , but I'm unable to use it .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Yes . The DS102 series .
__label__anger	oh , no ! I thought it seemed a bit strange .
__label__noemo	Well . Cantonese food is rather light , Beijing food is heavy , and Sichuan food is usually hot and spicy .
__label__noemo	Hi , what brings you to my office today ?
__label__noemo	Thanks . Where shall we put our luggage ?
__label__noemo	Is that right ?
__label__noemo	Sir , may I please see your license and registration ? Do you know how fast you were going ?
__label__noemo	Either can be done , though we usually quote on CIF basis .
__label__noemo	Hi , Mary ! You're here already . Where's Harry ?
__label__noemo	May I know where you are going ?
__label__joy	Me too .
__label__noemo	Hmm . Sounds like she has pretty pricey tastes .
__label__noemo	It's a little eerie . I'm sure the silence will begin to grow on me .
__label__noemo	His father is a prisoner .
__label__noemo	I know , I know . Kill , or die , right ?
__label__noemo	Is IKEA affordable ?
__label__noemo	Don't worry about it .
__label__noemo	Then what should I do ?
__label__noemo	That's right .
__label__noemo	What would you like to do today ?
__label__noemo	Actually , that's what a lot of parents in Taiwan say to their kids .
__label__noemo	I'll have whatever you're having .
__label__noemo	Of course . Your balance is 92,320 RIB in your Securities Account . How much would you like to withdraw ?
__label__noemo	My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight .
__label__noemo	My chief interest is swimming and climbing with my friends .
__label__noemo	Hello . Is there a package tour to Beijing ?
__label__noemo	Hello , I bought a pen in your shop just before .
__label__noemo	It's too biased . I just don't agree with their one-sided reporting .
__label__noemo	I had to move it , so that I can get my bike through .
__label__joy	Yes . I like it very much .
__label__noemo	Yeah . You know what Dave just said ?
__label__noemo	Can we step into the conference room ? This is a more private conversation .
__label__joy	That sounds like a good idea .
__label__noemo	I want to open a savings account .
__label__noemo	Oh , it ’ s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ?
__label__surprise	But , Sharon , that's illegal ! The police could come , and we could go to jail .
__label__noemo	OK . Would you like to live in a studio ?
__label__noemo	I need a phone card for this new cell phone .
__label__noemo	No . I won't let you ride a bicycle late at night .
__label__noemo	Of course . Do you have your passport with you ? How much would you like to purchase ?
__label__noemo	You know , just giving me lots to do . I'm really busy right now .
__label__noemo	sure , but I don't drink much . So I don't know what to order .
__label__disgust	I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me .
__label__joy	It's nice to hear that anyway .
__label__joy	But of course ! Well , it ’ s been great talking to you , but I have to get going .
__label__noemo	Yes . Do you have any direct flight to Tokyo ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me , ma'am . Can you tell me where the nearest postoffice is ?
__label__noemo	Perhaps you didn't know that we have new room rates . Do you find that acceptable , sir ?
__label__noemo	I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter .
__label__noemo	You know , about David and new boss .
__label__joy	Personally I liked the main character . He was true to type .
__label__sadness	Billy ...
__label__noemo	Dreadful . There , the door is open now .
__label__noemo	But as far as I remember , you two caught on like a house on fire when you first met .
__label__noemo	The seven-days trip shall be fine . How much is this tour ?
__label__surprise	You mean installation isn't included ? I'm very surprised .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Thank you for calling . I really appreciate your kindness . But right now , I ’ m very busy preparing for an interview of another company . I don ’ t think I am available for this opportunity .
__label__anger	Gentleman ! Hah ! Fat chance ! Hah ! Eat your heart out , sucker ! Hah !
__label__noemo	I remember my first break up . It was the worst feeling in the world . I was crying everyday for three months . And slowly , it got better . I know you'll feel better too .
__label__noemo	You mean that is my business .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t know . But he must be a big shot .
__label__noemo	Yes , here you are .
__label__noemo	OK . Dad ! I'm coming .
__label__noemo	it costs more than you think to run a car , especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
__label__noemo	May I help you ?
__label__noemo	That's right .
__label__noemo	All right . In my first teaching position I received the Excellent Teaching award the past two years in succession .
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__noemo	Summers is hot and usually lasts a long time . Winters are short , but cold , wet , and windy . I love the summers in my city , but I hate the wintertime .
__label__noemo	Well , if you can wait until tomorrow night , I'll go with you then .
__label__noemo	Let me take a look . Just a second . That ’ s no problem , Susan . See you on Wednesday .
__label__noemo	All right . Please wait for a minute .
__label__noemo	Oh . I see . I would like to have mashed potatoes and chocolate pudding .
__label__joy	Pretty good , thanks . I'm going to see my uncle .
__label__noemo	Yes , hello . Our company used your bank to send some documents to Malaysia last week . Could you check and see if the proceeds have come back yet , please ? It's Sang Hung Enterprises , based in Kula Lump .
__label__noemo	Well , I think I was being a little selfish myself . I know they don't get to see each other very often .
__label__noemo	Don't use a hair spray . I want my hair set and dried .
__label__noemo	Cheer up . You have got me at least .
__label__noemo	This is the rush hour .
__label__joy	Good-bye . See you again sometime .
__label__noemo	Absolutely . The only difference is in the restaurant and bar vouchers .
__label__noemo	Yes , I ’ m 38 years old .
__label__noemo	But I may lose my job , doctor ! It's hard to get a job like mine .
__label__noemo	You have a total of 21 days paid time off which can be used for vacation , personal , or sick leave .
__label__noemo	Let ’ s go to WAngFuJing by bus .
__label__noemo	The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
__label__noemo	What account would you like to transfer the money from ?
__label__noemo	Just a moment , please . Your name ?
__label__noemo	Is there anything you can do for me ? If I don ’ t make it to shanghai in time , my wife is going go kill me .
__label__noemo	Are the swim stations open 24 hours , like the rest of the gym ?
__label__noemo	Good afternoon .
__label__noemo	Yes , people just seem to drift apart .
__label__joy	Thanks you for the encouragement .
__label__noemo	Well , it is hard to say . At least you need to come up with a good reason .
__label__noemo	That's really cheap . What are the fees included ?
__label__noemo	All right , madam . For which dates do you want to book the rooms ?
__label__noemo	Yes , here you go .
__label__noemo	Ok , actually I don ’ t mind eating peas and carrots.But I hate broccoli and cauliflower .
__label__joy	Yeah , that's right . If you find this person is more and more important to you and you can totally trust her , then you can stay in love .
__label__noemo	What did you say to your boss ?
__label__joy	That sounds like a good idea .
__label__joy	sounds good . You have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . I know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms , especially if the stores have special offers .
__label__noemo	What class will you fly ? First class ? Business class ? Or economy class ?
__label__noemo	One dollar and twenty cents . You give me the money and I ’ ll exchange it for a token .
__label__joy	I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops .
__label__noemo	Work is kicking my ass . I'm so stressed . Let's go grab a drink .
__label__joy	Thanks . I'm glad you say so . Oh , the music has stopped .
__label__joy	Yes , I do . It ’ s very interesting . What ’ s your job ?
__label__noemo	Um , ninety-five dollars ?
__label__noemo	I think so . They don't sell shoddy cloth for one thing .
__label__joy	Sure . What is it ?
__label__noemo	I don't know how to say it in English .
__label__joy	Thanks , thanks a lot and thanks a million .
__label__noemo	Mark ? I need that file you took yesterday .
__label__noemo	Just dial 0 , wait for the dial tone , and then dial the phone number you want to call . Or we can place a call for you , if you want .
__label__noemo	What does a mango taste like ?
__label__joy	Fine . See you later .
__label__noemo	That ’ s my only one .
__label__noemo	I'd like two kilos of eggs .
__label__noemo	Yes , I had a look around yesterday . I wish I could have them all . Can you give me a price list with specifications ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s ok . I should have told you earlier . This is a company rule .
__label__noemo	Actually , I don't like history . Lately , these shows are always about the Pyramids .
__label__joy	Very well . We ’ Ve got everything taken care of already .
__label__joy	Yes , very good .
__label__noemo	It ’ s truly exciting to work in newly emerging unified market . Brussels will be center of the new market in the continent .
__label__noemo	Yes , you should be there . Go find the manager and ask . I think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . Don ’ t forget to fill in the leave application form . It will be signed by the manager for approval .
__label__noemo	Yes , my name is Brian and my phone number is 5294870 .
__label__noemo	Is everything to your satisfaction ?
__label__noemo	Is breakfast included ?
__label__joy	Don't be silly .
__label__noemo	Go ahead .
__label__noemo	I don't think you've met my sister , Mary .
__label__noemo	Hi , Becky , what's up ?
__label__noemo	To speak frankly , it doesn't depend on me .
__label__noemo	because it's off-season , we got a really good package deal to Paris , so we went there .
__label__noemo	On Friday morning , Mr . Wang , the director of Shanghai Research Institute , will visit you at the hotel . In the afternoon , you will discuss some problems with Mr . Yang , vice manager of computer corporation .
__label__anger	the air quality in this city is horrendous ! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again !
__label__noemo	I understand you are selling the same products to some other Australian importers . This tends to complicate my business . As you know , I am experienced in the business of slippers and enjoy a good business relationship with all the leading whole - sabers and retailers in that line . I have a mind to expand this business in the years to come . One of the reasons of my visit here is to sign a sole agency agreement with you on these items for a period of 3 years . As it is to our mutual interests and profit , I am sure you'll have no objection to it .
__label__noemo	Are these four pieces all your luggage ?
__label__noemo	There are two more , one is orange and the other is pink . I have bought them all .
__label__noemo	No , you can return it to any branch of our company .
__label__joy	It makes me feel rather shabby . That woman has a good taste in dressing , I would say .
__label__anger	I've created a monster ... you're a better bayer than me !
__label__noemo	Some other time then ?
__label__noemo	That's my cousin Hubert.He likes smiling .
__label__noemo	What happened ?
__label__joy	I ’ Ve been to Qingdao before , so I ’ ll choose Dalian . I've heard that the environment there is very good .
__label__noemo	That's too bad . I wish your mother can recover soon .
__label__noemo	I think you ’ re right . Climate change naturally over time , but I think that human activities are speeding up the change . I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem .
__label__joy	And I've never heard such good sound in a game .
__label__noemo	Mom , I finished .
__label__noemo	Well , you'd better lie down now . You need a good rest .
__label__noemo	Hello , ma'am . Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	A party of 13 .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , are you Mr Williams from America ?
__label__joy	Sounds like a good idea .
__label__noemo	They have two children-one son and one daughter-as well as one daughter-in-law and one son-in-law .
__label__noemo	Can we get any more help at the International Center ?
__label__joy	I love you , happy anniversary .
__label__noemo	I can send that information to you .
__label__noemo	Yes , it's fine . However , I personally think the fairways between the greens are a bit too long , especially for such a hot climate . Don't they have carts ?
__label__noemo	And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ?
__label__noemo	Can you get me a beach umbrella and a deck chair ? I am really tired of lying in thousand .
__label__joy	I'll get them back right away .
__label__noemo	How's it going ?
__label__joy	Great . The bed is exactly what I have been looking for !
__label__noemo	I fell down and hurt my arm .
__label__noemo	He wanted to take it home yesterday .
__label__noemo	Have you already forgotten ? What's the date today ?
__label__sadness	Good morning , doctor . I've been suffering very much from a toothache lately .
__label__joy	Jim , I heard you took a trip to San Diego . Is that right ?
__label__noemo	What What features do they offer ?
__label__noemo	I really like Japanese or Thai food .
__label__noemo	To start with , may I know why you are interested in working for our company ?
__label__noemo	Now what can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Go three blocks and turn right . It's right there .
__label__noemo	Good afternoon , how can I help you ?
__label__noemo	I need a pan .
__label__noemo	Of course . It's just at 19 Lingual Road . You can phone me again if you can't find the right place .
__label__noemo	Yes . If I don ' t make it to Beijing tomorrow morning . my wife would kill me . How much does it cost ?
__label__joy	Oh , congratulations !
__label__noemo	That ’ s not a big problem . There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified .
__label__noemo	Where you can buy lots of paraphernalia ?
__label__noemo	Is it very cold in winter ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I ’ m serious .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , sir.Is there anything I can do for you ?
__label__noemo	In about 2 hours .
__label__noemo	Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ?
__label__noemo	You are very welcome .
__label__noemo	Just two people .
__label__disgust	It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected .
__label__noemo	May I help you ?
__label__noemo	good morning !
__label__disgust	I don ’ t want to post my personal information on the internet . I ’ m not knowing who is reading it .
__label__noemo	It depends on the amount and how fast you want that person to receive the money . A SWIFT transfer is the fastest method but a banker's draft is usually the cheapest . How much do you wanna send ?
__label__noemo	Do I need to pay any extra change for my suitcases ?
__label__noemo	Hello there ! Come on in ! Don ’ t just stand there ! Come and take a seat !
__label__noemo	Do you play table tennis ?
__label__noemo	He must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
__label__noemo	Are you ready , honey ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I needed a large one . Before , I had a separate refrigerator and freezer , but this has both combined into one .
__label__noemo	My name is Jeff .
__label__noemo	Just about half an hour ago .
__label__noemo	Where ’ s Sally , Jack ?
__label__joy	How do you like these dishes ?
__label__noemo	By the way , what kind of stores do we need to go ?
__label__noemo	You're in great shape , Keith . Do you work out at a gym ?
__label__noemo	What do you want ?
__label__noemo	My name is Gavin White . I was born and raised in London . After high school , I went to Edinburgh University . I worked for one year to pay for my tuition and then got my Bachelor ’ s degree there . Now I've come here to get my Master ’ s degree . I am glad to meet all of you and I hope we will become good friends .
__label__noemo	Won't it be dangerous ?
__label__noemo	Yes . Right now I have a studio .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry , ladies . Mr . Smith's viewing is over . It ended an hour ago .
__label__noemo	You know that I care for you . I .. I ’ m proud of you .
__label__joy	I'm sorry . What's your name again ?
__label__noemo	It's a big leather suitcase with my name ' Lily ' on it .
__label__noemo	800 yuan a month .
__label__noemo	Yes , I worked as a doctor at Beijing People's Hospital .
__label__noemo	My name is Jim Jones . Are you coming for the interview ?
__label__noemo	Sure . We just got some . They're upto-date .
__label__joy	Here is a present for you . I hope you like it .
__label__noemo	Our price is worked out according to the costing . A 20 % commission means an increase in our price . So , I'm afraid we have to decline your proposal of acting as our sole agent .
__label__noemo	What is the best place to park ?
__label__noemo	hi . I ’ m feeling very nervous . I just had a test and I ’ m not sure how well or how badly I did .
__label__joy	Let's call it a deal . Hope to see you again soon . Keep in touch then . Byebye .
__label__surprise	What , Hilary ? I ’ m really in a hurry !
__label__fear	I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height !
__label__noemo	Fill this out , please .
__label__noemo	I usually don ’ t have time for a bath in the mornings , so I just take a shower . Sometimes I need a cold shower to wake me up and sometimes I need a hot one , especially if it ’ s winter and I need to warm up .
__label__joy	Dancing . The boys from the Campus Band have promised to play music for us .
__label__noemo	Hi , Cindy . It ’ s Michael Kurt . Is Mr . Johnson in ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I took off 4 kilos . I am glad you notice it .
__label__noemo	I mostly listen to pop music , but I like a lot of different stuff .
__label__noemo	are you looking forward to doing more editing work ?
__label__noemo	Why not ?
__label__noemo	I'm not sure.But if you are only going to stay a year , I don't think Price Club is good to join.They have great deals occasionally.They are very good for people who like to buy new things all
__label__noemo	You ’ re not nervous , are you ?
__label__noemo	Not yet . I'm not finished with my research yet .
__label__noemo	Certainly . See you in the afternoon .
__label__noemo	Yes . They will be ready in a few minutes .
__label__noemo	Jack , I think it's best that I actively ask for the results of interview .
__label__noemo	What are you guys doing ?
__label__noemo	He can just say , I'm Benjamin . I'm new and shy .
__label__noemo	Where's Bill ? The ambassador is already here . The meeting is set to start at 9 am .
__label__noemo	I've never tried traditional Greek yogurt , so I want to try that first .
__label__noemo	No , I am sorry I have no idea . I am a stranger here .
__label__noemo	Not really . Besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . People can't just wear whatever they want .
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . I thought maybe it was just the time of the day , although it isn't usually busy at 2:30 in the afternoon .
__label__joy	OK , how about 12:30 PM ?
__label__noemo	No no , I just changed my eating habits . I eat a balance meal . and I eat less than before .
__label__joy	That's great ! Can you give me the key to the locker ? I can't wait to have a try .
__label__noemo	What are you doing over the weekend , Sara ?
__label__noemo	Is this dine-in or take-out ?
__label__noemo	Not too serious . But he gave me a strict diet to help bring it down .
__label__noemo	I don't know . I feel like going out .
__label__noemo	Thanks , Mrs . Doff . Please tell him to be at the airport at three p . m .
__label__noemo	You were so happy , weren ’ t you ?
__label__noemo	That's very sensible of you . We have many fresh graduates applying for credit cards , getting them and then going on a spending spree and being unable to meet the repayments .
__label__noemo	How many people are there in your family ?
__label__joy	Wow , you're so lucky . I saw it on TV . But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall .
__label__noemo	Don't worry . I'll make you another on the house .
__label__noemo	Icecream , please .
__label__joy	Yes , yes . Everything's fine . Thank you very much , Becky .
__label__joy	Good for you , keep it up .
__label__noemo	Yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll have to get a couple in different colors .
__label__noemo	It doesn't seem to be so easy .
__label__noemo	I am trying to decide what school to apply to ?
__label__noemo	Are you ready to go to the bank ?
__label__noemo	Everything is OK . The commission is 50 yuan .
__label__noemo	I'll beat him .
__label__noemo	That's cheap .
__label__noemo	That would be great ! I hate working with computers !
__label__noemo	What do you like about him ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry . I meant to ask you .
__label__noemo	No , I'm not.you can just drive slowly and carefully .
__label__noemo	Do you think I should ask Bob to help ? Will he come ?
__label__noemo	Yes , that will be easiest .
__label__noemo	Some friends of mine are going to visit me this evening . Would you please buy some fruit for me ?
__label__noemo	Let me see . That one goes for $ 17 .
__label__noemo	Well , we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . The trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid we can't . $ 12.50 is our rock bottom price . If you purchase more than 10,000 units we can reduce it to $ 12.00 .
__label__joy	This one comes with its own folding keyboard . It has a pre-installed handwriting recognition program . I can use the stylus to write on the screen .
__label__noemo	Tina , you should have more nutritious food.Don ' t eat these crisps any more .
__label__noemo	No , it's the number fifty-eight .
__label__noemo	It was entertaining in some ways . But in general I didn't like it .
__label__noemo	I think I will . It's difficult to feel longly when you have a pet around .
__label__noemo	I can help you . How much money do you make per year ?
__label__noemo	What should we take ?
__label__noemo	My friend finally dumped her boyfriend , and she's sworn she's going to abstain until she finds the right man to marry .
__label__noemo	Are you watching the soccer match tonight ? It must be the most exciting one in this season .
__label__noemo	What seems to be the problem ?
__label__noemo	Yeah . I played until I graduated from high school .
__label__noemo	What is it ?
__label__noemo	... Okay , that's it . Here's the form , and here's my old card to use as a model .
__label__noemo	Where are you from , Ms.Baker ?
__label__joy	Sounds great . That's just what I feel like having .
__label__noemo	That's because you did well .
__label__noemo	I want to get a passport .
__label__noemo	Excuse me .
__label__noemo	Sir , your dish will take 5 minutes to prepare . While waiting , would you like anything to drink ?
__label__noemo	No , can I exchange it for a bigger one ?
__label__noemo	We have water coming through . It was raining yesterday and this morning we noticed a wet patch on our ceiling .
__label__noemo	Okay , Rebecca . Now you ’ Ve given me a good idea of your work and academic background , but what about you as a person ? How would you describe your key strengths ?
__label__noemo	Do I have to memorize it ?
__label__joy	Yes , it's a good habit to have a life-long hobby . Those who practise calligraphy and Qigong always live longer .
__label__noemo	What sort of western food do you like best ?
__label__noemo	How do you like other films starring Charlie Chaplin ?
__label__noemo	Still , there are some rules to follow .
__label__joy	It's my pleasure .
__label__noemo	That's a good idea .
__label__noemo	Let's post on the Internet , too . Will get a better response . I'll post the ads . I know some good sites .
__label__noemo	I never did either , but it pays the bills .
__label__noemo	What are the roses going for ?
__label__noemo	Till the end of the week .
__label__noemo	Hi Linda , this is Todd .
__label__noemo	I understand .
__label__noemo	Oh , that ’ s easy . Go to yahoo.com . Now , click on the link with the picture of an envelope .
__label__noemo	A $ 100,000 policy shouldn ’ t be too expensive . Here , call my agent . He ’ ll give you a good deal .
__label__noemo	Did you even bother to go to school today ?
__label__noemo	You'll soon get accustomed to it . It's not difficult . Well , here's the bus.Fortunately , it's not full .
__label__noemo	Go ahead , please .
__label__noemo	I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat !
__label__noemo	I haven ’ t seen you for several days .
__label__joy	Thank you . I have an appointment with an important client at 10
__label__joy	It's fantastic .
__label__noemo	I'm right outside my room .
__label__noemo	Well , how many tax-free things can I bring with me ?
__label__noemo	I am not sure .
__label__noemo	Will you need a wake up call , sir ?
__label__noemo	I stayed with my friends .
__label__noemo	How about this one ?
__label__joy	Oh , that ’ s very kind of you . I am going to the Garden Hotel .
__label__noemo	What's the most popular sport in your country ?
__label__noemo	OK . Which day do you want to book ?
__label__noemo	I am sorry , I have broken my wine glass , and would you please bring me another ?
__label__noemo	You can easily download it from their website .
__label__joy	Everything appears to be in order . Thank you for your time .
__label__noemo	They didn ’ t accept me .
__label__joy	No , thanks . I'm full .
__label__noemo	I got it .
__label__noemo	Is there anything else I can do for you ?
__label__noemo	I want to send this letter to the US by airmail .
__label__noemo	that makes sense . Who interviewed you ?
__label__noemo	It's the same as usual . The only difference lies in that you need to paste the book as an attachment .
__label__noemo	Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows .
__label__noemo	Where are you heading , sir ?
__label__noemo	Well . To be honest , I usually sucked up to teachers because I wanted them to give me good grades . However , Miss Baymler didn ’ t treat me any differently . She really didn ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets .
__label__noemo	Not a problem . Anything else ?
__label__noemo	All I did so far was make a bid on the Buddha . It was easy !
__label__noemo	What if I want to use CD-ROMs or floppies ?
__label__noemo	let ’ s get back to you . How was your day ?
__label__noemo	Is there anything else you'd like to get ?
__label__joy	Come on , don ’ t flatter me anymore . I took the job because I love being challenged . But I can ’ t get this turned around without the support from you people .
__label__noemo	Lodge , You must come around sometime , You have to check out my mew stereo .
__label__noemo	Well , I don ’ t like it , but I guess I don ’ t have any choice .
__label__surprise	Really ? In New Berlin ?
__label__joy	Thanks for calling , Blanca . I'll see you tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Haven't the Olympics been stopped for a long time ?
__label__noemo	What question ?
__label__noemo	You got that right ... and my mom's still mad about what we did with the dishes .
__label__noemo	It's really a good book . You will like it too .
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__anger	What ! I resent that !
__label__noemo	Well , I would prefer you to call me up tomorrow at 6:30
__label__joy	You're welcome , honey . I hope we will celebrate our golden wedding anniversary in future .
__label__noemo	Have you thought about what your needs are in terms of size ?
__label__disgust	All I know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me !
__label__noemo	Good morning , I ’ m Daniel . I ’ m applying for the positon of manager .
__label__noemo	So , Lauren , I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative , Jason Huntley .
__label__noemo	I am confused . How could a golfer need so many clubs ? Seems to me , 14 altogether , right
__label__noemo	Are there many idioms in English ?
__label__noemo	Well , with the ticket , you can get a free drink . What would you like ? Orange juice ?
__label__noemo	All right , can I have your passbook ?
__label__noemo	What happens then ?
__label__noemo	Did you already wash your clothes today ?
__label__joy	That sounds attractive , all right , how about that we sign a one year contract ?
__label__noemo	I'll be here to pick you up at 6:30 .
__label__joy	no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week .
__label__joy	Wow ! Bali Islands have some of the best beaches in the world , don't they ?
__label__noemo	We can take the train , that will be faster . I'II book the tickets tomorrow morning .
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry , sir . Smoking is not permitted in this area .
__label__noemo	Do I need to do anything else after I turn in the application ?
__label__noemo	Like what ? I think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction .
__label__noemo	No .
__label__noemo	Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know . Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more .
__label__sadness	I ’ m not in the mood .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , Mr . Macmillan ?
__label__noemo	I think you should give it a shot . What do you have to lose ? You can always change your mind .
__label__joy	I like the sound of that .
__label__noemo	Don't worry . I ’ Ve got some acid here . It will help dissolve the hair down there .
__label__noemo	Excellent . Well , what other questions do you have Rebecca ?
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve got a new boss .
__label__noemo	No , we just don ’ t usually admit it !
__label__noemo	I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ?
__label__noemo	That's good to hear . You've had an ideal recovery from your operation . We're going to send you home tomorrow .
__label__noemo	part of the motor is loose . I can put it back in place quite easily .
__label__noemo	The wire in your phone might have gotten rusty . Could you bring your phone into our office ? We'll clean it for you .
__label__noemo	What's he like ?
__label__joy	Oh , it's my pleasure . After all , you are very qualified for the position .
__label__noemo	But what if something happened to them ? What would happen to my money ?
__label__noemo	Greetings should never be ignored in the interview .
__label__noemo	I have no idea .
__label__noemo	Why are you feeling depressed ?
__label__joy	Well , I have them in my bag . I'Il put them on right away !
__label__joy	Bottoms up .
__label__joy	You must be Wily . It's nice to meet you .
__label__joy	Very glad to know something about you , then what are you going to do when you finish .
__label__noemo	I suppose the additional premium for the special coverage is for the buyer's account .
__label__noemo	Please be at the airport two hours before your departure to check in . You also need to reconfirm your reservation with the airline at least 7 days prior to your departure .
__label__noemo	What's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t agree , but anyways , I think you should start thinking of a new year ’ s resolution yourself .
__label__noemo	I love it . It's so festive ! And where did you get that cup ? It's got the same logo .
__label__noemo	good morning ! I'd like to make a reservation , please . Do you have any rooms available for the next week ?
__label__noemo	No . I was here last semester , but I didn ’ t find out about this class in time . So I ’ m taking it this semester .
__label__noemo	Overseas operator , may I help you ?
__label__noemo	Have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ?
__label__noemo	Until next weekend , if that's OK .
__label__noemo	About ten years so far . I started learning when I was in middle school .
__label__noemo	Yes , speaking . What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	You have lots of friends . They will be there , too !
__label__anger	Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true .
__label__noemo	It's a question of quality , Ma'am . At that price , you would not get good equipment . I've been in this business for almost twenty years . I know what happens.If you don't get quality air conditioning now , you will just have to replace the system after two years .
__label__noemo	The survey said that the low , income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis .
__label__noemo	I have passed the five courses required by the Chinese CPA Association , but the certificate won't come to hand until next month . How about that ?
__label__noemo	The vegetables seem to not be very fresh .
__label__noemo	Next week , it ’ s going to be quite a shock for him !
__label__noemo	Fred , we're gonna have a meeting after half an hour . Have you got it ?
__label__noemo	We would like to start you off at 1,500 yuan a month , not including bonus and overtime pay . We don ’ t give bonus every month , but we offer a semi-annual bonus . And you will receive two weeks paid vacation a year , as well . Does it suit you ?
__label__noemo	Hold on , let me put it on the scale . It weighs up to 10kg and that will be 30 Yuan , please .
__label__noemo	Yes . Twice .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll remember that for next time . You ’ ll get extra peas and carrots , buy no broccoli or cauliflower . OK ?
__label__joy	OK , take care ! Hey , nice running into you !
__label__noemo	Actually , I study a lot less here than I did in Taiwan ! My classes are great , though . Sociology is the perfect major for me .
__label__noemo	Thank you , sir .
__label__noemo	The ad says $ 325 plus deposit .
__label__noemo	What about tomorrow evening ?
__label__noemo	About more three days , I think .
__label__noemo	A 9:12 flight in the morning and a 14:00 flight in the afternoon .
__label__noemo	Well , this desktop over here is our latest model . It has a four gigahertz processor with sixteen gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte . Of course , it includes a mouse , keyboard and desk speakers .
__label__noemo	Do you play basketball well ?
__label__joy	Okay , I ’ ll take four , please . You saved me a lot .
__label__noemo	Actually , the woman playing Ophelia is a past classmate of mine .
__label__noemo	What's the departure time ?
__label__noemo	well , there ’ s a wildlife documentary on tv in a few minutes . Shall we ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry . She ’ s in a meeting right now .
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	Okay .
__label__noemo	I don't know yet . What's your idea , Dad ?
__label__noemo	Here you go .
__label__surprise	What ! For being a couple of hours late ? You have to be kidding !
__label__noemo	I would like to have shelled shrimps with cashew nuts .
__label__noemo	Yeah .
__label__noemo	Sure.How about the brown one ?
__label__noemo	Don't worry . I won't .
__label__noemo	But newspapers do get some extra income by offering space for ads .
__label__noemo	Yes , I think she will .
__label__noemo	The new year is coming . Is the final examination approaching .
__label__noemo	Yes , he has . He sold it last week .
__label__noemo	Ok , sir , it sounds like you might have a virus .
__label__noemo	All right !
__label__noemo	I don't know what you mean .
__label__anger	Dad ! I ’ m gonna catch a cold !
__label__noemo	I am glad you let me know that you will be missing class . Get well !
__label__noemo	I would like to buy two exquisite watches for me and my girlfriend .
__label__noemo	Sauvignon Blanc ? What's that ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong .
__label__noemo	Oh , come on ! A tour of Australia would be relaxing because you ’ d be doing something different and not working .
__label__noemo	Yes , you like them very much . right ?
__label__noemo	Alright , sir . I will get the paperwork ready for you . Just a moment .
__label__noemo	Martin ? Did you remember to bring back that software I lent you ?
__label__noemo	He ’ s fine , but he had a fever last week . He probably just had a cold .
__label__joy	Thanks for your help .
__label__noemo	Yes , what can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Time flies !
__label__noemo	Did you take a photo with her ?
__label__noemo	May I speak to Mrs . Liu , please ?
__label__noemo	Look on the bright side . At least you have a job .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry , but can you give me a three-day turnaround ?
__label__noemo	What else are you interested in ?
__label__noemo	We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams .
__label__noemo	Would you like a window or an aisle seat , Mr . Smith ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s as easy as pie . I always follow recipes .
__label__noemo	I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse effect .
__label__joy	It ’ s a wonderful party , Joan , The food , the drink , the atmosphere ... Everyone is enjoying himself .
__label__noemo	There are a few stories about natural disasters . There is a massive forest fire in Australia . It covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers .
__label__noemo	I hate to do this , but I've got to cancel a reservation I made earlier this week .
__label__noemo	Did you find anything ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s not really an occasion , it ’ s more like I ’ m sorry .
__label__joy	That sounds absolutely fantastic .
__label__joy	Good idea .
__label__noemo	Do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing ?
__label__noemo	My paper is on the influence of television on children .
__label__noemo	I'm going to my parents ' house for my father's birthday .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , I didn't know that . But I wanna help .
__label__noemo	I don't think so . You look full of energy every day . Time has stood still with you .
__label__noemo	no , I don't have anything to declare .
__label__noemo	Which airport , ma'am ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry , but it's a bad movie . The plot is stupid , and the script is poorly written .
__label__noemo	Well , that ’ s not possible . The computer ’ s official student account has already been sent to the state . And that ’ s what our budget is based on . Who told you that anyway ?
__label__noemo	A little bit , but I know that the elevator isn't enclosed . at least I wouldn't be smothered there .
__label__joy	Hey , great set of wheels .
__label__noemo	Good morning !
__label__noemo	I'm afraid he's having an important meeting now . Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	For now , I would like to run a few more tests to look into some of the problems that you mentioned .
__label__noemo	Just some soft drinks and only a bottle of beer .
__label__noemo	Give them a buzz ? What can I say to them ? Say that you want a loan ?
__label__noemo	Here ’ s 30 yuan .
__label__noemo	Do you know how to turn them on ?
__label__noemo	Mr . : I'm Mr . Rogers , your homeroom teacher .
__label__noemo	Good . I think it's a good idea . Our department should require meetings like this .
__label__noemo	No more than three .
__label__joy	Fine , just get it ! We have been shopping for furniture for five hours ! I ’ m so tired !
__label__noemo	Well , ou can't hear music until takeoff .
__label__noemo	Salesman ?
__label__joy	I'm glad you're so happy .
__label__joy	I think that would be nice .
__label__noemo	Would you like me to type it for you ?
__label__noemo	How do you know ?
__label__noemo	I want to immigrate to the States because my daughter works and lives there .
__label__noemo	We both may be snakes , Dave , but I'm just better at it . Among the snakes , I'm the sneakiest .
__label__noemo	Well , you really didn't do all that well .
__label__noemo	Very well , I'll try the banana flavor .
__label__noemo	I need 8 hundreds and the rest in 10s please ?
__label__noemo	Maybe a vanilla ice cream milkshake would be good . What's your favorite flavor ?
__label__noemo	Is she acting up in class ?
__label__noemo	I saw garlic ice cream on the menu once .
__label__noemo	Sure ?
__label__noemo	What ?
__label__noemo	exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment .
__label__noemo	Hello , Mr . Liang . I've done with the work . My report is here so please give me new instructions .
__label__noemo	By the way , could you give me a manicure ? Use a light nail-polish , please .
__label__noemo	It's a luminous watch with a time-reminder function .
__label__noemo	Master of Marketing Management .
__label__noemo	There's no problem here , everything's in order . I can transact that for you now .
__label__surprise	Really ? It looks so nice .
__label__noemo	Is it really going to take that long ? Will you rush the order ?
__label__noemo	How about this one ?
__label__noemo	I Couldn't care less .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes . My husband also has some laundry . This is his suit and here is his pajamas .
__label__noemo	That's all right . What can I do ?
__label__noemo	What ?
__label__joy	Great ! Many thanks !
__label__joy	I know he has brought great trouble to you . A million thanks .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , can you show me the cloisonn bracelet in the counter ?
__label__noemo	Yes , sir . You're booked on Flight 201 , leaving in one hour .
__label__noemo	No , not yet . I'd like to buy a teapot .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid this flight is all booked up .
__label__noemo	Take it easy . It's not serious . You should keep the wound very clean .
__label__joy	What special effects ?
__label__noemo	What do you think of AC milan and the team of Argentine ?
__label__noemo	I'm afraid not , we're very short-staffed at the moment . Can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime ? Perhaps Tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement .
__label__noemo	I can give you quarters , if that'll help .
__label__noemo	It's a little green post-it note , stuck right in the middle of my computer screen .
__label__joy	That's Cathy . She is pretty , isn't she ? She likes dancing . Ask her to dance .
__label__noemo	Hello , madam . Would you like to take a look at our products ? They are high-tech items .
__label__noemo	Please to meet you Mrs Chen . My name is Joy . Welcome to the hotel . Here is the keys , registration slips and breakfast description . Breakfast will be served from seven tomorrow morning . Is there any change of your schedule ?
__label__noemo	No upgrade of any kind . And where might you be going ?
__label__noemo	Yes , is there something wrong ?
__label__noemo	What are you studying all day long for ? It ’ s summer vacation !
__label__joy	I'm glad I could help .
__label__noemo	Yes . May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Oh , please ! Don't be so old-fashioned ! It's totally safe .
__label__noemo	Don't you spend a lot of money then ?
__label__sadness	That's too bad.They ' re such good company .
__label__noemo	Yes , of course.Will you come with the receipt ?
__label__noemo	Hey ! Where are you going ... ?
__label__joy	No problem . We have a nice apartment located near the Oriental Square . It's perfect for people busy with office work . It is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .
__label__noemo	Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry . I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter .
__label__joy	So I know . Thanks .
__label__noemo	I have never shopped there , but I think Price Club is a kind of membership store .
__label__surprise	Look who you get to sit next to--Tim from purchasing !
__label__noemo	Sorry ? What does VOC stand for ?
__label__noemo	One economy , please .
__label__noemo	Don't always joke like that ! You don't have a gun .
__label__noemo	By credit card , please . And what kind of credit cards do you honor ?
__label__joy	It's a beautiful drive .
__label__noemo	Hi , Martin . I ’ Ve been looking for you all morning .
__label__noemo	Yes , it's Yao Lan . Room 406 .
__label__noemo	You look like a cooking show host--only messier .
__label__noemo	Well , they consider some distinct but related problems , such as seeking for a target market or locating the promising customer . An exporter needs to know about the social characteristics of people he is dealing with .
__label__noemo	I decided to take Kenny to the park and get some fresh air .
__label__noemo	What else do I have to do ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m terribly sorry , sir , but I ’ m afraid it is true . That flight has been canceled . Would you like to try to book tomorrow ’ s flight ?
__label__noemo	That's fine . What about operating the fax and duplicator ?
__label__noemo	It is my first time coming to China . I want to buy something unique of China to my friends as gifts .
__label__noemo	I wonder how all the businesses in the area feel about that .

__label__noemo	Mary ? Are you still there ?
__label__noemo	Welcome to ABC Company . We have been expecting you , please have a seat . I will call him .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for ocean transportation .
__label__noemo	Sir , we never want a guest to stay here mad or unhappy .
__label__noemo	What kinds of sports do you like ?
__label__noemo	Would you prefer to take similar medicine of other brands ?
__label__noemo	I'd really like to help you out , but I am broke myself .
__label__joy	Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it .
__label__joy	You are kidding .
__label__noemo	Have they set a date for the wedding ?
__label__noemo	For a year and a half .
__label__noemo	Look . Two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . That's why that car stops .
__label__noemo	Do they pay you a lot ?
__label__noemo	So how's everything going for Christmas ?
__label__joy	No problem . I'd be happy to .
__label__joy	I certainly can.If I can get some from the butchers , I ’ ll cook them for you .
__label__noemo	That's right .
__label__noemo	Eh ?
__label__noemo	It's okay . It's a really big campus .
__label__noemo	What kind of person do you consider yourself to be ?
__label__noemo	Ms . Lee , could you tell me what number 7 is again ? I didn't catch you .

__label__noemo	Yeah . He's the most experienced athlete in the field .
__label__joy	Thank you for your inition . I'm free tonight .
__label__noemo	I'm really not sure .
__label__noemo	Ok , here is $ 50 . Oh , can you make out an invoice for me ?
__label__noemo	For here or to go ?
__label__noemo	He ’ s really good looking . he ’ s quite tall , around 61 , he ’ s in his early thirties , and he ’ s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes ...
__label__noemo	Voting is simple .
__label__noemo	All right . Let me have a check . Can you tell me how can you inspect your exported goods ?
__label__noemo	I would've come to see you sooner , but I've been busy too .
__label__noemo	No , not really .
__label__noemo	Yes , she needs something to help her at school .
__label__noemo	You ’ re right .
__label__joy	Www , I don ’ t know how you can eat your eggs like that ! Ever since I was small , I ’ Ve had eggs and soldiers .
__label__noemo	and can you dance tango ?
__label__surprise	Are you sure ? Then , I will have more beer , please .
__label__noemo	That's how it works .
__label__noemo	what about a factory tour ?
__label__noemo	Okay , this afternoon you have a meeting with your accountant at 5 pm .
__label__noemo	Why not ?
__label__noemo	Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ’ ll look at something in a shop , but lat
__label__noemo	More or less . How well do you understand Mr . Wang , your Chinese teacher ?
__label__noemo	Sure , no problem . Asking for leave again ? You have been absent from class five times this semester .
__label__noemo	My name's John Sandals .
__label__noemo	I think I would like the former one .
__label__noemo	Here is 4 dollars , keep the change .
__label__noemo	Ok , sir , it sounds like you might have a virus .
__label__noemo	Yes , I would like to look at some of your products . I think what I am using now does not fit me well .
__label__noemo	From my own experience as a career woman , I would have to say that while things are getting better now than they used to be , it is still a widespread problem . Society is changing , but there is still a glass ceiling for women in many career tracks .
__label__noemo	Yeah . Here .
__label__noemo	Where were you ?
__label__noemo	Thanks . I had learned so much from you and our colleagues .
__label__noemo	I need to move some furniture . Could you help me to lift it ?
__label__joy	I'd love to .
__label__noemo	Oh , I think she wants to do this thing in memory of her father .
__label__joy	Because it is convenient and good for environmental protection .
__label__noemo	I'm glad we live in a small town .
__label__noemo	Yes , what a nice dinner that was !
__label__noemo	Ok . On the top , Mr . Thomas , the managing director , is responsible for running the company .
__label__noemo	Do I need to buy them ripe , or will they ripen at home ?
__label__noemo	You're absolutely right . I think the acting could be better .
__label__noemo	Can't you stay for a little bit longer , it's only 8 .
__label__noemo	Her father is dying .
__label__noemo	Would you like your hair washed as well ?
__label__noemo	No , I haven ’ t had a cold . I just have a heavy feeling in my chest when I try to breathe .
__label__noemo	What about Next Monday ?
__label__noemo	Bring those upstairs and put them in the bedroom .
__label__noemo	I'll hold you to that .
__label__noemo	Today more and more people advocate lifelong learning . But people have different views about lifelong learning . How do you understand lifelong learning ?
__label__joy	You're welcome , have a safe trip .
__label__noemo	OK !
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__joy	Yes , they are .
__label__noemo	All superstitious nonsense ! I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks .
__label__noemo	Twice a week . How about you ?
__label__noemo	Well , Mr . Cui , could you tell me why you are interested in working with this company ?
__label__noemo	For two days .
__label__noemo	Football of course !
__label__noemo	And how well can you speak them ?
__label__surprise	What ? Beg your pardon .
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__noemo	Anyway , I'm still happy I left . I'm working as a freelancer now .
__label__noemo	If I couldn ’ t wait , could the prescription be mailed to me ?
__label__noemo	Oh , good morning , Mrs . Liu . I'm calling to see if you have received my resume that I sent to you by Email .
__label__noemo	Yes , that's possible .
__label__noemo	Sure , but you must have access to the Internet .
__label__noemo	I'd like two twin beds , please .
__label__noemo	Yes , we do . we also eat mutton .
__label__joy	Hey John . I have some great news .
__label__noemo	What kind of benefits does this job have ?
__label__noemo	What shall I call him ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend . Nobody sticks around in the summer .
__label__noemo	Mike promised to help us .
__label__noemo	Poor Ben , your wife is too mean to you . She gives you so little money every time when you are out .
__label__noemo	What do you think are the capacities for a success as a translator ?
__label__noemo	Yes . When you have decided exactly what you want and have a purchase price we can begin to process the loan . As long as you provide the proper documentation , of course .
__label__noemo	I won't be too long , I suppose . Just let me ring them , will you ?
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__noemo	I must be off now . I'm pressed for time .
__label__noemo	Hi , Christine . How ’ s it going ?
__label__joy	Do you know that I fell in love with you at the first sight .
__label__joy	That sounds pretty good to me , but I am not sure what to do .
__label__joy	This looks like a nice restaurant .
__label__noemo	What an idiot !
__label__noemo	why not ?
__label__noemo	As you know , we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion , so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product , L-series .
__label__noemo	By the way , can I renew the borrowing ?
__label__noemo	My wife is sick , so I have to cancel a reservation I made .
__label__noemo	Oh , it's rice rolls with fried shrimp inside .
__label__noemo	You are smart . The city is really charming at night .
__label__noemo	I hope so , Dana . My instructions are to negotiate hard on this deal , but I'm trying very hard to reach some middle ground .
__label__noemo	She's glowing . It must be the pregnancy .
__label__joy	Oh , my God . It ’ s beautiful . But it looks expensive .
__label__noemo	How many times did you stab the victim ?
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Give it to me . I need to use it .
__label__joy	Ok , thank you .
__label__noemo	Anything is worth a try . But right now I really just want to find a quiet place to take a nap .
__label__noemo	No , sir . The sign says No Turn on Red .
__label__noemo	My grandmother swears by hot chicken soup for a cold .
__label__noemo	He's out of his office .
__label__noemo	I will see you tomorrow .
__label__surprise	You're not going to make anything to eat ?
__label__noemo	The second one sounds rather difficult to answer . What did you tell her ?
__label__noemo	The only thing I can do now is waiting for another chance .
__label__joy	Yeah , it is a good idea . You can stay in my house for the night if you would like to .
__label__joy	I agree . I ’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo . I don ’ t like animals experiments though . I believe that we can do tests in other ways .
__label__noemo	Could you teach me how to drive ?
__label__noemo	We have a beautiful selection of eye shadows this fall . Look at the colors . Aren't they beautiful ?
__label__noemo	I may just go to the DMV today , so I can pay the fine .
__label__noemo	Judy , have you ever made out how much money shall we spend ?
__label__noemo	There ’ s no catch ! You just choose a plan , sign a three-year contract and , that ’ s it ! Actually , we ’ re running a special promotion right now , and we ’ regiving away a Blackberry Curve with our special Mega Value forty dollar plan .
__label__noemo	No later than tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Yes , unlikely my flight will be 2 hours due to the fog . Would you please keep my reservation ?
__label__noemo	How will I know what the results mean on the website ?
__label__noemo	How can you help me ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	I'm going to do it , but you have to be sure you really want me to .
__label__noemo	he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
__label__noemo	I had my first cigarette when I was seventeen .
__label__joy	OK , thank you .
__label__noemo	Come on ! We have been here for almost an hour ! I thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish !
__label__noemo	What were you thinking ?
__label__noemo	How about afternoon ?
__label__noemo	First class or coach ?
__label__noemo	See you .
__label__noemo	It's inevitable . Their love wasbuilt on the sand , and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks .
__label__noemo	Having a good diet is probably the most important thing .
__label__noemo	Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?
__label__noemo	Come on . You know , you can never really win . The salesperson never loses . They make their living out of it .
__label__noemo	I'd like a pillow as Well .
__label__noemo	What ?
__label__noemo	Would you like to order now or wait for a while ?
__label__noemo	You are so right , sir . The clock just struck nine .
__label__noemo	No . It's all Greek to me .
__label__noemo	Why aren't you doing your homework ?
__label__fear	Really , it's so beautiful .
__label__noemo	They have anything you want .
__label__noemo	That makes sense . I will do it .
__label__noemo	Hi , I need broadband for my computer .
__label__noemo	We have a nice garden-view room .
__label__noemo	don ’ t worry . Sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the clearing or take care of the children .
__label__noemo	I'm having a party this Friday .
__label__noemo	For what time , sir ?
__label__noemo	I wanted to attend this school originally , but my grades out of high school weren ’ t good enough .
__label__joy	Me too , they're such a nice couple .
__label__noemo	Of course . This product moisturizes at the same time .
__label__noemo	I know . But she said she had an important thing to tell you .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I'm expecting to come back on Tuesday .
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . Let me guess ... something sexy for the new bride on her first night of marriage ?
__label__noemo	I will .
__label__noemo	That would be 346 Euro .
__label__noemo	You should very qualified .
__label__noemo	First of all , as far as I know , your company has had impressive records in business . Second , I want to enter the foreign trade field .
__label__noemo	Yes , I did . I had a fine time .
__label__noemo	Hackers are smart , and they want people to know about it .
__label__noemo	Yes , of course . It's so much easier than cash , to be honest ; nowadays I hardly ever use cash . I just put it on the card and pay off the balance every month .
__label__noemo	You will need to send the tripod as luggage because it is too long to fit in our gauge box for carry-on items .
__label__noemo	Let ’ s go to Wangfujing by bus .
__label__noemo	I'd love to , but I don't care for skating very much .
__label__noemo	I ’ d be glad to help .
__label__noemo	Christmas doesn't come until the end of the year , does it ?
__label__noemo	Hello . I have a reservation , under the name Lee , Leo Lee .
__label__noemo	I have prepared name cards to be put on the conference table for everyone to sit by . What time would you like to provide the refreshment ?
__label__noemo	Maybe we should try a thai massage too .
__label__joy	We can take the MET and get off at the Zoo Station .
__label__joy	Well , thank you very much .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t worry . You can take night classes . I did that when I had kids . And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . Then you could find a job and work .
__label__noemo	They say we can't . They don't look after customers ' stuff .
__label__noemo	Yes , the house was in a terrible mess . It was almost turned upside down by the burglar .
__label__noemo	That should be no problem . May I have your full name , please ?
__label__joy	You are doing the waltz wonderfully well .
__label__noemo	According to what you did last time , I have my doubts .
__label__noemo	Hectic . It's always hectic . But how was your windsurfing ?
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__noemo	Ninety dollars is pretty steep . I'll take it for sixty bucks .
__label__joy	Yes . It should be the fragrance of plum blossoms .
__label__noemo	He sounds more like an artist than a businessman .
__label__noemo	How should I take this medicine ?
__label__noemo	I have something important to do , can you fast the speed ?
__label__noemo	It's kind of cool that they are still using the same Star Wars theme song for this movie .
__label__noemo	Good afternoon . How can I help ?
__label__noemo	Yes , please .
__label__noemo	For more than five years .
__label__noemo	I see .
__label__noemo	Forget it ! We seemingly need to gather money little by little .
__label__joy	Yes , of course . I love the picnic party . It ’ s really family fun time .
__label__noemo	I heard that Kevin got divorced . Is that true ?
__label__noemo	Paris in the spring , eh ?
__label__noemo	But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses .
__label__noemo	did you get the position you wanted ?
__label__joy	This means digital camcorders can be connected with the digital equipments you have at home , like your digital TV or your computer .
__label__noemo	Here is my driver's license . Will that work ?
__label__noemo	do you have experience in the IT field ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s called Counter Strike . It ’ s a first person shooter game . It ’ s awesome . It ’ s a multi player game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world .
__label__noemo	Well , that depends on the rate . How much is the RIB trading at today ?
__label__joy	OK .
__label__noemo	Tomb Sweeping Day is a traditional festival in China , on which many Chinese mourn the dead .
__label__noemo	Yeah , he did . But he only won it by a hair's breadth .
__label__noemo	I think that they should pay more tax . Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people ’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes .
__label__noemo	Hi there ! I am looking for a new car . I have this old Ford Pinto that I would like to trade in .
__label__joy	Ok , I ’ ll try my best .
__label__noemo	Is this the foreign exchange department ?
__label__noemo	But two players of the team have been booked and one is out .
__label__noemo	Well , I ’ d better get back to work . I ’ Ve got a ton of stuff on my desk !
__label__noemo	I want to buy some cloth to make a curtain . Which one is better ?
__label__noemo	What are the purposes of contract ?
__label__noemo	Gosh , it's 7:30 , I'll miss the first class .
__label__noemo	alright . I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
__label__noemo	Our room rates recently went up . Is that okay with you , Mr . Sandals ?
__label__noemo	My telephone number is 4837625 .
__label__noemo	12,000 yuan a year , but you can't have visitors live in it .
__label__joy	Cool ! Is it safe for us to eat there though ?
__label__noemo	Her dress looks funny .
__label__noemo	All right . But so help me it better work .
__label__noemo	Would you be able to reserve it for me ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s all right . Where are you going ?
__label__noemo	That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me .
__label__noemo	It's about time .
__label__noemo	If it was sunning all year round there would be drought.you probably would not like it either .
__label__noemo	I am looking for some information about home stay .
__label__noemo	What can I do for you today ?
__label__noemo	Let's see.How do you feel about playing bridge ?
__label__noemo	Very much.What time ?
__label__joy	Jane , I appreciate it very much . I expect to see you get nominated pretty soon , too . You've been doing some great work !
__label__joy	Of course , what can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Hello , Beijing Hotel .
__label__noemo	Step into my office for a moment . What is your concern ?
__label__noemo	Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll open the window .
__label__joy	Well , my particular interest is collecting stamps , especially the rare ones . What about you ?
__label__noemo	I've got no kite . Do you have one ?
__label__noemo	Are they filed alphabetically ?
__label__noemo	It's like $ 130 each ticket .
__label__noemo	I was wondering if you could help me use the Student Job Center .
__label__noemo	Yes , It is the right one .
__label__surprise	You gossip ! What's the basis of your opinion ?
__label__noemo	Yes , we checked out just now .
__label__joy	Nice ! Let ' s go !
__label__noemo	You ’ re leaving so soon . When are you off ?
__label__noemo	My children can never be obedient even if I criticized them severely .
__label__noemo	Please tell him to call Mr.Baker at the Grand Restaurant . It's urgent .
__label__noemo	Tingling is on TV .
__label__joy	It's nice talking to you . But I have to go .
__label__noemo	Hi , Mary , you have been a secretary for several years in this company . Could you tell me what a secretary should do for a meeting or a conference ?
__label__noemo	I guess so . But the music is too loud . I don ’ t mind getting out and meeting people , but next time I ’ ll do it in a park .
__label__noemo	See you then .
__label__joy	I'm so glad that the Spring Festival is near at hand .
__label__joy	Sure , I'd love to meet the cast ! Have you ever been in a play ?
__label__noemo	Hello , Pratt . How was your interview yesterday ?
__label__noemo	yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district .
__label__noemo	I think that they will move in the day after tomorrow .
__label__joy	Yes , that would be perfect .
__label__noemo	It moved slowly up the stairs , step by step , and I could hear its approaching footsteps . When it finally got to the top of the stairs , I realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . He had gone to get a late night snack .
__label__noemo	Do you want to insure it ?
__label__noemo	Do you mind if we talk about your schedule tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	Would you ask him to tell us more about the country ?
__label__noemo	Do you have an appointment ?
__label__noemo	¥ 200 a day or ¥ 1200 a week , unlimited mileage .
__label__noemo	Hey Sarah , I'm having some trouble finding an apartment . Can you help me look at some listings online ?
__label__noemo	May I introduce myself ? I am steven smith .
__label__noemo	How much are the roses ?
__label__noemo	I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ?
__label__noemo	He ’ ll get used to it . They always do . I still remember when my daughter started . Are you going with him on his first day ?
__label__noemo	That's all ?
__label__noemo	So , Jimmy , how does it feel to have your own money ?
__label__noemo	Yes , very . They make the trip in about an hour .
__label__noemo	I think I will get my food from Panda Express , too .
__label__noemo	Nothing came in the mail telling me my polling place .
__label__joy	You missed the film.That ' s a shame .
__label__noemo	You come back here with me tomorrow , and it's my treat !
__label__noemo	I'm sorry . I forgot to show it to you . Here it is . It comes with the pan .
__label__noemo	If the weather's fine .
__label__surprise	That ’ s my brother !
__label__noemo	I'm older than you ! I'll be ten on April 14th .
__label__noemo	Yeah , look at all those new buildings going up ! Mr . Zhang , the traffic is pretty smooth . But we were told the roads from the airport to downtown were quite crowded and traffic jams could be as long as half an hour .
__label__noemo	I sure did ! What about you ?
__label__noemo	What were you planning on seeing ?
__label__noemo	Thank you.That ' s the result of exercise.By the way , do you work out ?
__label__noemo	Well , I've never downloaded music before . How does it work ?
__label__noemo	Speaking of The X-files , it's on right now !
__label__noemo	"Actually , you can take advantage of our "" New Millennium Woman "" promotion ."
__label__joy	Yes , the service really added to the experience .
__label__noemo	We appreciate your intention , but the amount of your orders last year was moderate .
__label__joy	I had fun also and was wondering if you would like to go hiking with me in the mountains on Saturday .
__label__noemo	No problem.madam.But I think the red sweater is not colorfast.Would you like to have it dry cleaned ?
__label__noemo	part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ?
__label__noemo	Have you found anything nice yet ?
__label__noemo	I'm Lui , I'd like to Speak to Mr . Smiths .
__label__noemo	I really have no excuse , madam .
__label__noemo	Oh , you didn ’ t know that apartments here are considered valuable , even if they are small and crowded ?
__label__noemo	What are you talking about ? I have salads some times .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll be paying with cash .
__label__noemo	Actually , I'd like a booth by the window if that's possible .
__label__noemo	I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .
__label__noemo	Wrong . lt's not a place name , but a passionate act .
__label__noemo	You actually need to catch two buses .
__label__noemo	That's a real achievement . How did you do that ?
__label__noemo	Do you have a reservation ?
__label__noemo	Not really . I could take it or leave it .
__label__joy	Hi , Julie . I was in your neighborhood and I'd like to drop by .
__label__noemo	Are you in favor of having a trip during the spring break ?
__label__noemo	We've heard so much about Chinese film stars divorcing foreigners .
__label__noemo	Would you like a lift home ?
__label__anger	I want justice .
__label__noemo	How much loan capital can we safely raise then ?
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	There's an airsickness bag behind the seat that's in front of you .
__label__noemo	Yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received a pay rise . It's unfair .
__label__noemo	Now you know you have to clean your bathtub every time when you use it .
__label__noemo	It looks fine . Is this an inclusive tour ?
__label__noemo	Um , I ’ m just having a look around . It ’ s my girlfriend ’ s birthday tomorrow . I'm trying to find her something .
__label__noemo	I want to study Mandarin and international relations .
__label__noemo	Ok . I ’ ll take it .
__label__noemo	Go to window number eleven .
__label__noemo	Yep . I just can't decide what two cities to choose ...
__label__noemo	Well , apparently , he was just getting into his car-he'd parked it in one of those underground multi-story things-he was just getting in and suddenly three guys with guns opened the back doors of the car and got in .
__label__joy	Much better than the last one , huh ?
__label__joy	No trouble at all . I think maybe you will meet some of my friends here as well .
__label__noemo	She promised that we'd be ready to start tracking the Stars.com web site by the end of next week .
__label__noemo	So are we . Our counter-offer is in line with the world market .
__label__joy	I would like that . Thank you .
__label__noemo	Do you have any publications ?
__label__joy	Well , you really do have a talent for this , Alice . Thanks for the suggestions .
__label__noemo	not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life .
__label__noemo	No , not at all . Go ahead .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I just got them . I started playing ice hockey in a community league . So , I finally got myself new skates .
__label__noemo	That sounds like a hot job , right ? But in my opinion , you ought not to choose one career from that so-called list , and you need to take your interests , values , and skills into account .
__label__noemo	Good morning.May I help you ?
__label__joy	Wow , that's my favorite . It's like a superman shooting right up into the sky .
__label__joy	Okay . I understand . I ’ ll call the Customer Service Office of the manufacturer . Thank you .
__label__noemo	Around 200 RIB for a truck .
__label__joy	I used to go hunting with my uncle , that's how .
__label__noemo	Do you need to be located in a particular school district ?
__label__noemo	Show me the black one , my size .
__label__noemo	Oh , honey , I'm so sorry , we don't have enough space for you to have your own room .
__label__joy	It ’ s my pleasure .
__label__noemo	I hope so .
__label__noemo	You should have seen the T . V . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights .
__label__noemo	Hello , this is Helen speaking .
__label__noemo	Yes , that's what I am doing .
__label__joy	Yes that might be a better idea .
__label__noemo	Welcome to IBA . Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Do I have to buy extra ticket if I want to visit the main spots ?
__label__noemo	Suit yourself . Don ’ t forget to set the alarm clock .
__label__noemo	Because he is often in trouble .
__label__noemo	I already voted .
__label__noemo	How so ?
__label__noemo	No problem . I am used to it .
__label__joy	Got it . Thanks for reminding me . And , are there any intensive training courses ?
__label__noemo	It's not that serious .
__label__noemo	Ok .
__label__noemo	Well , I was a diligent student when I stayed in my college . I dislike meeting the deadline , when I am working on a project . I am always willing to complete it well ahead of the schedule .
__label__noemo	I thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong !
__label__noemo	Then open that window.Yeah , that one .
__label__noemo	Mind your own business .
__label__noemo	If you damage the video , you will be fined .
__label__noemo	I'd like to check out .
__label__noemo	My vote is my own private business .
__label__noemo	I'd like to buy a bottle of Centrum , a tooth brushes .
__label__noemo	Well , I will do it better .
__label__noemo	Let me try it on . I think it really suits me . Can you give me some discount on it ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s no problem .
__label__noemo	They're all here .
__label__noemo	I don't know , but I feel terrible .
__label__noemo	Pyramid scheme ? What is that ?
__label__noemo	Hello . I want to buy some RIB , is it OK to use US dollars ?
__label__noemo	Are you having any luck ?
__label__noemo	I'll make a report for you and please claim this to the insurance company with this report .
__label__noemo	Oh , I'm sorry , Nigel . I'm rushing to a meet right now .
__label__noemo	How much are these apples ?
__label__noemo	Any special colors ?
__label__noemo	Did you bring your ID ?
__label__noemo	Can you pay cash , then ?
__label__noemo	Ah I see , yes you do sound rather croaky.Well let ’ s have a look , shall we ? Could you please open your mouth and say ah .
__label__noemo	It was about a married couple . They had to live with the wife's mother , because they didn't have enough money to buy a house of their own .
__label__joy	It is . I love it .
__label__noemo	But then what would I do every weekend ?
__label__noemo	I ’ ll need to check . Sorry , we don ’ t have any in stock . But I can order some and send through the order today . How many do you need ?
__label__noemo	Let's sing it together , shall we ?
__label__joy	Goodbye , Alice .
__label__noemo	OK . I'll pick you up here tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Hello , Tom , are you free next Sunday ?
__label__joy	Do you know how happy I am ? The Ant Kingdom is a perfect world with colorful fairy tales . It seems like the air is fresh here .
__label__joy	That would be a good idea .
__label__noemo	I trust your judgement . Thank you , Quinn . I'll be back tomorrow with a new set . Bye for now .
__label__noemo	Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school ?
__label__noemo	I think the slight pay decrease might be worth it . The benefits are much better .
__label__joy	Yes , we did , we did have problems , but we shared a lot of happiness too . We countered the problems , and had a lot of happiness too .
__label__noemo	I have it right here .
__label__noemo	That was a great shot ! A three pointer , yeah !
__label__noemo	In five years , I ’ d like to be a senior manager of this corporation .
__label__noemo	Our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . Can you serve them in English ?
__label__noemo	Is it all right for me to come in now , Mr Sun ?
__label__noemo	He's out of John's hands . Nothing he can do about such a black sheep .
__label__noemo	I have a meeting this afternoon .
__label__noemo	Well sir , our sales have dropped , no plunged , fifty percent in the past month alone . We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory , or getting rid of our staff . If we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ’ s a real mess .
__label__noemo	It was bought on November 12th at 3
__label__noemo	It ’ s up on the second floor . You have to use the stairs . The elevator isn ’ t working .
__label__noemo	what do you have in mind ?
__label__noemo	Rudy Randolph , 818-555-1234 , April 9 through 15 .
__label__joy	Hi , Mary , long time no see .
__label__noemo	Here comes Jordan , though .
__label__noemo	Wow . What fillings do you recommend ?
__label__noemo	What exactly do you want ?
__label__noemo	Exactly what ?
__label__noemo	I am really excited to be taking this workshop so that I can get ready for my interview next week .
__label__noemo	Besides that , many people took to gambling and got in over their heads , and gradually ruined themselves .
__label__joy	Thank you very much . See you then .
__label__noemo	I thought you had grown out of such child practices .
__label__noemo	You'll have to attend a three-week course . If you do well , the job is yours .
__label__noemo	Debit card .
__label__noemo	so what are you going to do about it ?
__label__noemo	I agree . But I think although it has some negative effects , on the whole Internet does more good to us than harm .
__label__noemo	I would rather buy them somewhere else .
__label__noemo	How's her skin ?
__label__noemo	The delicatessen department is on the second floor .
__label__noemo	Yes , I like it , because it's convenient .
__label__joy	Ha , ha ! Those days are long gone .
__label__noemo	May I show you gold ones or jade ones ?
__label__noemo	The movie starts at eight o ’ clock , so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
__label__noemo	Definitely .
__label__noemo	Yes ? Why not ?
__label__noemo	It's your blood pressure , I'm afraid . It's far too high .
__label__noemo	what do you hope to do when you finish university ?
__label__noemo	I have some cold tablets if you would like one .
__label__noemo	Well , Miss Liu , I've enjoyed talking with you . Thank you for your interest in this job .
__label__surprise	Are you kidding me ?
__label__noemo	No , there isn't , but there are some vegetables .
__label__noemo	But I find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same . So I doubt its authority .
__label__noemo	You can apply for one right now , if you ’ d like .
__label__noemo	We have darker ones . Do you like the style ?
__label__noemo	Straight on , and turn right . Is it far ?
__label__noemo	definitely ! I would include one or two on each page if possible . Remember that you should make the report as eye-catching as possible .
__label__noemo	Hi , Alex . Would you come with me to supply ? I ’ Ve got to pick up a load of stuff and I ’ m afraid I can ’ t carry it all .
__label__noemo	that's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark .
__label__noemo	That's great !
__label__noemo	Bell Computers Limited , can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I know . I must get my traveler ’ s check and some foreign currency .
__label__noemo	What kind of games do you like ?
__label__noemo	Well , his wife is Japanese . He said she makes really good sushi .
__label__noemo	That shouldn't be a problem . What is the exact address , again ?
__label__noemo	Yes , where do you want to go ?
__label__noemo	I've got a headache .
__label__noemo	Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__noemo	There's a car waiting for you just outside the door . Right this way , please .
__label__noemo	What about the divided skirt ?
__label__noemo	Yes . Players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball . This is called ” tackling ” , as in football .
__label__noemo	I'm very sorry . When was this purchase made ?
__label__joy	That sounds all right to us .
__label__joy	Yes , it looks interesting .
__label__noemo	No , the other three girls major in a computer science , and they can help me a lot with the computer operating .
__label__noemo	It's okay .
__label__noemo	all right .
__label__noemo	OK class , so today we are going to continue with our anatomy class , today we will review everything we have learned . Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is ?
__label__joy	Thank you for coming , Ms.baker .
__label__noemo	Sorry .
__label__joy	Sounds like fun ! When we go he always just likes to play in the sandbox .
__label__noemo	let's go !
__label__noemo	We would like a smaller cozy cottage with 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom .
__label__joy	That is a long way to go . It is so kind of you to help me . Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	That's because I went to school for each class when I was at school . So now I am much more clever than you .
__label__joy	Yes , I hope so . Thank you for telling me this .
__label__noemo	About what ?
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Um .
__label__noemo	What's wrong ? You don't like ancient Egypt ?
__label__joy	Maybe we ’ ll meet some of the artists too .
__label__noemo	The total will be $ 32.42 . Will that be cash ?
__label__noemo	What time did you say the train is leaving ?
__label__noemo	Could you cancel a check for me ?
__label__noemo	I am calling to tell you the items you are supposed to bring for the interview the day after tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Mr . McKenna , do you have a second ? I need to talk to you about something .
__label__noemo	In this period , you can only get the basic salary , 2,500 yuan per month .
__label__noemo	first , you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
__label__noemo	Yes . I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology .
__label__noemo	Ok , would you like some soup as well ?
__label__noemo	Sunny side up , please .
__label__noemo	It'll be close , but we'll make it .
__label__noemo	Why don't you run outside ?
__label__noemo	our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes .
__label__noemo	Never underestimate a woman when it comes to bargaining !
__label__noemo	I really want to obtain a permanent job . I won't leave as long as I have opportunity to apply my knowledge and get on well with my superiors and colleagues .
__label__noemo	Yes . If they think you are a fit , maybe they will contact you .
__label__joy	Thanks for letting me know .
__label__surprise	Accountancy ? Really ? She must be very good at figures .
__label__noemo	Let ’ s call it a day .
__label__noemo	I'll have the baked salmon .
__label__noemo	Well Mr . Black , I appreciate your interest in our company , but I doubt you can do this job properly .
__label__noemo	So , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . Where do you exercise ?
__label__noemo	"I agree . But even though I like comedies , I usually prefer more serious films . My favorite movie is "" Titanic . """
__label__noemo	I agree with you , sir , but all I do is work here .
__label__noemo	Do I have to travel a lot ?
__label__noemo	RIB deposit .
__label__noemo	French , please .
__label__noemo	Why do you say that ?
__label__noemo	Oh . Current account don ’ t pay our interest .
__label__noemo	Since the May holiday is the high season , you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . Here ’ s the phone number .
__label__noemo	It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld .
__label__noemo	Hi . I ’ m interested in renting a one-bedroom apartment .
__label__noemo	Deposit it into my checking account .
__label__noemo	That would be our Savers Plus account . You must pay 10 000 yuan into your deposit account . In this way you can get 5 % dividend at the end of the year .
__label__anger	That ’ s exactly what they did .
__label__noemo	All right . I'll take it .
__label__noemo	You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
__label__joy	Thank you . Nice to meet you , too .
__label__noemo	Really ? Why ?
__label__noemo	yes , it was a very evenly matched game .
__label__noemo	Nine would be perfect . I'll see you then !
__label__noemo	That sounds very good . Which website should I visit to download it ?
__label__joy	That ’ s okay . I ’ ll call back later .
__label__noemo	When do you usually go to the movies ?
__label__noemo	A Korean film called Friends , starring Sang Dong-gun .
__label__noemo	It's OK . I'll leave the pamphlet here . If you need more information , you can call me any time .
__label__noemo	Oh , yeah , It ’ s quite of variety . Regular , cold perm , straight perm , pink curl and form .
__label__joy	Julie ! It's good to see you again . How have you been ?
__label__noemo	sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ?
__label__noemo	Let's make it the first item of business in our next meeting .
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__noemo	I will prepare your desserts and have someone bring you your drinks right away .
__label__noemo	I saw your car outside , so I stooped by .
__label__noemo	I need to order new business cards .
__label__noemo	Over here , Betty !
__label__noemo	Don't forget it's Friday nighty . If Frankfurt's anything like London , everybody will be leaving for the weekend . It will be a rush hour and traffic might be moving very slowly .
__label__noemo	I see .
__label__noemo	Is there anything I can do ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s a typical of them to do so .
__label__noemo	For me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ?
__label__noemo	That's unbelievable . Why did this happen ?
__label__joy	Now , we are out of the town , you can drive freely !
__label__noemo	I can't think the same .
__label__noemo	These machines aren ’ t very difficult to use . In fact , I quite like them . They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk .
__label__noemo	Right now I ’ m working on a product launch project to open up our Asian market . We have several upcoming events to take place for the Japanese cities . We ’ ll be heading to Tokyo next month to get things started . What I would like to talk to you about is joining our team to help bring this project to completion .
__label__noemo	What will I earn per year in this job ?
__label__noemo	When can I come and see you ?
__label__noemo	That is exactly what we're looking for .
__label__surprise	Oh , did you ? Thanks a lot .
__label__noemo	That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs .
__label__noemo	I would like to sign up for some classes .
__label__noemo	that Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ?
__label__noemo	I think I know who you're talking about .
__label__noemo	That ’ s okay . I ’ ll call back later .
__label__surprise	Really ? They ’ Ve been together for a long time . When are they getting married ?
__label__noemo	OK , done . When will it show in my account ? Not for withdrawal , I mean just registered .
__label__noemo	You're so right ! Today's movies are just too commercial !
__label__noemo	Fine .
__label__noemo	I'm looking for a pan I can use in my kitchen .
__label__noemo	We need to work is because we need money to live . We need money for food and clothes and to pay for house . We need money for many different things , and only when we work , we can earn money . And work can also help us feel that we are useful .
__label__noemo	no . let me take a look ... it ’ s longer than my car .
__label__noemo	I'd like to purchase a pan .
__label__noemo	Well , there are several kinds of steaks . For example , you can have your steaks medium-rare , medium-well or well-done .
__label__joy	And the bank will offer you loans for twenty years !
__label__noemo	Sorry to hear that ! But I would definitely recommend this place !
__label__noemo	I will poke your eyes out .
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__joy	You are welcome . Good luck .
__label__noemo	was it very old house ?
__label__surprise	Really ? Where ?
__label__sadness	Oh . I just can ’ t forget it .
__label__noemo	What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	What did he say ?
__label__noemo	We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution laws have been introduced .
__label__noemo	I just think it will be a little difficult for her to be away from home for so long right off the bat .
__label__noemo	I do , but if I don't have any credit in my phone , it won't let me call or send messages .
__label__surprise	Sure ! Look , it suits you well .
__label__joy	Oh , hey , Keri ! You cook , right ! You're a pretty good cook .
__label__joy	So it has attracted more and more customers these days .
__label__joy	You are right . Let ’ s stop idling around and do something .
__label__noemo	Nothing earlier ? I prefer flight at nine thirty .
__label__noemo	I think it ’ s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to London , so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway .
__label__noemo	You see , that ’ s what I ’ m talking about , I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
__label__joy	I ’ m ready looking forward to it . This party is going to be a blast !
__label__noemo	That apartment never had any problems before . Are you sure the problem isn ’ t you ?
__label__noemo	What is the reason for extension ?
__label__surprise	Splendid ! When is it gonna be finished ?
__label__noemo	We have beef soup and tomato soup .
__label__noemo	The ad says the rent would be 840 dollars per month . Is it true ?
__label__noemo	Can I have a look at your letter of acceptance ?
__label__anger	Yes , but you might have told me before .
__label__noemo	Open your suitcase please .
__label__noemo	Here we are . How does it fit ?
__label__sadness	The post office.Sorry . I ’ m not sure .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll take three light blue ones , please .
__label__noemo	I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market .
__label__noemo	Never .
__label__noemo	Mr . Smith often talked about you .
__label__joy	Sounds pretty fun . I'll come out and join you next time .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I got home around two .
__label__noemo	Just get online and send your application through email to the employer .
__label__noemo	Good evening .
__label__noemo	Thank you for a lovely day . I really enjoyed it .
__label__noemo	No . Well , in America , 21 is the age when you're allowed to drink . So , many guys celebrate it in bars .
__label__noemo	He has worked five years in that bank .
__label__noemo	Yes please . Do you have any teas ?
__label__noemo	There are many amazing dishes to choose from . We can have some chicken tikka masala which is an amazing curry . It ' s a bit spicy , but I think you can handle it .
__label__noemo	By the way , I'm Robin .
__label__noemo	I would like to open an account please .
__label__joy	Good afternoon !
__label__noemo	How much will I have to pay ?
__label__noemo	You know , on a date . They're going to dinner .
__label__noemo	December 1st .
__label__anger	He sounds like a sick cow !
__label__noemo	Don't worry . I will help you soon . Please fill in this form first . And write down your name , your account number and the amount in your card please .
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve started an investment banking firm with some of my old colleagues from Goldman Sachs .
__label__noemo	How long does it usually take you to make delivery ?
__label__noemo	Where is some fresh produce that's on sale ?
__label__joy	Yeah , I heard it's going to be a lot of fun .
__label__noemo	What do I do after I get on the 268 ?
__label__noemo	If you try to adapt yourself to your destination's local time , you'll feel more comfortable . So please try to sleep , and have meals according to Los Angeles's time .
__label__sadness	Sorry , things on sale are not allowed to be refunded or exchanged .
__label__noemo	Yes , I would like to book a table for six for the next Monday .
__label__noemo	By credit .
__label__noemo	Sorry , sir . The only tickets of the same performance available are on 21st .
__label__noemo	I will be withholding my rent check this Friday unless these problems are addressed immediately .
__label__noemo	OK . I want to make an omelet , so actually this is really silly , I've never made one before . How do you make an omelet ?
__label__noemo	Uh-oh . We don't have a flashlight .
__label__noemo	Our jackets are over here next to coats and accessories .
__label__joy	No problem , sir .
__label__noemo	Could you please tell me the international prefix and the country code for Australia ?
__label__joy	Oh , thanks , professor Donald . This is really very nice of you .
__label__noemo	Did you buy anything ?
__label__noemo	We do have a storage space for your bags . There's a small charge , plus a deposit .
__label__noemo	Well , depends . You see , there are eight famous Chinese food cuisines , for instance , sichuan cuisine and HUNAN cuisine .
__label__noemo	I'd like to buy some Chinese-style cakes . Could you recommend me some ?
__label__noemo	I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her .
__label__noemo	You're under arrest for concealing illegal drugs .
__label__noemo	In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls .
__label__noemo	And this is your company's head office ?
__label__noemo	His name is Bingo .
__label__noemo	That's right . I drove it into a lamp post . Can your mechanics repair it ?
__label__noemo	I think one needs common knowledge , specific knowledge , and professional codes to be a successful translator .
__label__noemo	Would you like to mail it by air or sea ?
__label__noemo	German .
__label__noemo	Until this investigation is finished , will I have to pay for the charge ?
__label__sadness	I keep on meeting with difficulties in the experiment . I can hardly go on .
__label__noemo	Did he actually say that ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me . I'd like to cash the traveler's check .
__label__joy	I'm so glad I bought this watch !
__label__noemo	The right side . ICCC should be on the first floor .
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve received some special training in typing , shorthand and operating a fax machine , etc .. I ’ m experienced in IBM-PC . I can operate familiarly a word-processor , a fax machine , a photo and other office equipment .
__label__noemo	Yes , because I love yours .
__label__noemo	Certainly . We provide quality analysis training as part of the training for all new workers , plus a week of further training every year .
__label__joy	That sounds fine . I'll be there around seven .
__label__noemo	Certainly . Would you like your coffee with your dinner or later ?
__label__noemo	That sounds perfect . Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me Mr . Parsons .
__label__noemo	Yes , I see . Go home to bed and take one of these pills every three hours .
__label__noemo	I liked it . I didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring , in my opinion .
__label__noemo	Ladies and gentlemen , dear Mr . Simpson . Following the increasing communication between Unity Company and Pineapple Computer Company , we established steady cooperation . And today we all here feel very proud and honored to have Mr . Simpson with us . Mr . Simpson is well-known for his success and his career . So first of all , let me , on the behalf of all present here , extend our warm welcome and cordial greetings to our distinguished guest . Now let's invite Mr . Simpson to give us his speech .
__label__noemo	No , I can't make it today .
__label__noemo	All right , we'll take it .
__label__joy	That sounds great ! Have you eaten ?
__label__joy	Of course ! Where are the things ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s good news . The good thing is that most people treat their pets well .
__label__noemo	Yes , I've just come back from Scotland .
__label__noemo	No , there is an updated virgin , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes .
__label__noemo	I put it in the dressing room .
__label__noemo	Did you vote for him ?
__label__joy	OK . Bye .
__label__noemo	Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response for any click .
__label__noemo	We'll have to make sure to come back here again real soon .
__label__surprise	Really ? My name is Gretchen Hammer . What is your name ?
__label__noemo	Hugh Young ? Didn ’ t he use to wear a funny yellow jacket all the time ?
__label__noemo	After you've thought it over , get back to me and we can go ahead .
__label__joy	That's a great idea ; thanks for your help .
__label__noemo	Yes , my name is Ms Jane Reeve , R-E-E-V-E .
__label__noemo	Stay away from fried foods . Fried foods are fried in oil or fat .
__label__noemo	Of course , he was our monitor in college . How is him now ?
__label__noemo	Really ? What about your opinion , Daniel ?
__label__noemo	I ’ d love to but I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . I ’ Ve already got a lunch engagement .
__label__noemo	So what ? Things have changed .
__label__noemo	Oh , hi Melissa . Are you going to the conference too ? I was planning to pick up Mr . Campbell .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry I scratched your car .
__label__noemo	All right .
__label__noemo	I've got this important letter to send to Hainan . Can I send it by registered mail ?
__label__noemo	That's my style when I'm not in the office .
__label__noemo	Yes . The light in this room is too dim . Please get me a brighter one .
__label__noemo	Any serial , sir ?
__label__noemo	Never ever come to work drunk , also smoking in the office is not allowed .
__label__noemo	It sounds great . How much is the rent ?
__label__noemo	Ok , someone will be there by 12:15 .
__label__noemo	I ’ m very sorry , Miss Parks , but the 9:05 flight is completely booked . I can put you on a waiting list if you would like .
__label__noemo	Really ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I am looking for an apartment . I prefer living off campus . I can study better .
__label__noemo	Hi , I have a doctor ’ s appointment scheduled with Dr . Smith , and I need to change it .
__label__noemo	Not very much .
__label__noemo	Why do you worry about your future ? You're very young , and you'll make great contribution to the world . I hope you take my advice .
__label__noemo	Do you like the weather in Seattle ?
__label__disgust	I can't afford to move right now .
__label__noemo	Straight ahead to the traffic lights , left and then right .
__label__noemo	Do you want to type that letter ?
__label__noemo	Oh , yes , Miss Chen informed that the monthly management meeting has been changed to July 11 and I've marked your diary accordingly .
__label__noemo	Three every night .
__label__noemo	Are you still working ?
__label__anger	Stop it . Teacher doesn't treat me any different than she does everyone else .
__label__noemo	We are arriving at Wangfujing . Please get ready .
__label__noemo	You'll be able to take the test again in a couple weeks .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t think we can give you that much as the starting salary .
__label__noemo	Wait until you see what happens next ! The bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . Let's go over and watch .
__label__noemo	Can I do anything else to help with the itching ?
__label__noemo	How about the subway ?
__label__noemo	And it's best to ask about the second interview if necessary .
__label__noemo	Welcome to China , Mr . Smith .
__label__noemo	It will be fun . And besides , you'll be in the best company .
__label__noemo	hi . Could you give me a hand with this report ?
__label__noemo	What made you think that ?
__label__noemo	Do a lot of people ride that bus ?
__label__noemo	You ’ ll notice that the window treatments , carpeting , and drapes are all new .
__label__joy	Look , if you don ’ t love me , it ’ s not a thing , alright , we ’ Ve had our laughs , but I don ’ t appreciate ... maybe it ’ s just time we ...
__label__noemo	Poor John ! He is bettering bother sides of this bread .
__label__noemo	Because this is a public place , and I want to spend my time here without having to look at your garbage .
__label__noemo	If you give me cash , do you care if I don't fix the car ?
__label__noemo	Count me out . I can do without shills and snipers and turbo-bidders .
__label__noemo	Yes we checked on just now .
__label__noemo	I would get Fuji 200 film for taking photos of natural beauty .
__label__noemo	Hi , Li Ming . You look upset . What's the matter ?
__label__noemo	Go right ahead .
__label__noemo	they're related to one another , yes .
__label__noemo	Then do I have the chance to get this job ?
__label__noemo	How long have you had this pain ?
__label__noemo	What's the exact information ?
__label__noemo	Very good . How much does that cost ?
__label__noemo	I work for a large multinational company called DAK Group . We have five main area of business - construction , heavy industry , shipbuilding , motor vehicles and telecommunications .
__label__noemo	Is this a furry hat ?
__label__noemo	Well , for one , we have an excuse to stay home .
__label__noemo	Did you have to blow right next to the phone ?
__label__surprise	Oh , a bouquet of flowers . It's very kind of you .
__label__noemo	it's very light . That would be good . How is the battery life ?
__label__noemo	I just want to have a coffee , I think .
__label__noemo	Yes , please .
__label__noemo	It's my pleasure .
__label__noemo	I would prefer next Thursday .
__label__noemo	But sometimes they offer some useless proposals , it's awfully useless .
__label__noemo	So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?
__label__noemo	The final and mid-term are twenty percent each ; homework , attendance , and quizzes are the rest .
__label__noemo	What time does the museum open ?
__label__noemo	I have to go to work .
__label__noemo	Sir but what exactly is making everyone so angry ?
__label__noemo	I can tell you where I got mine .
__label__noemo	You can search for jobs on the computers at the EDD offices .
__label__noemo	That is good . He can leave you alone this time .
__label__noemo	OK . I need to think about that for a while .
__label__noemo	Have you taken Accounting for Decision-Making and Control ?
__label__joy	Do you want to visit any tourist spots in the city ?
__label__noemo	Oh , yes . Hi , how are you ?
__label__noemo	I hope you'll give a second thought to it .
__label__joy	Glad to meet you .
__label__noemo	Not much . I've go enough city life in Beijing .
__label__noemo	Don't look a gift horse in the mouth ! That was the best they had .
__label__noemo	I'm making a shopping budget , so that I don't spend too much money .
__label__noemo	Sixty cents a piece .
__label__noemo	30 % of the people are attracted by the style . Buyers always pay great attention to packing . In my opinion , these goods didn't sell well merely because of the poor packing .
__label__surprise	I have no idea what you ’ re talking about . The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl .
__label__noemo	And Roman really loves life . He knows how to enjoy himself .
__label__anger	Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make .
__label__noemo	He grew up poor in Kentucky and barely had a year of schooling , but he went on to become the President of United States .
__label__noemo	That's why I came to your office today . We think for your model WE - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 .
__label__noemo	My family is not big , there are only 3 of us-my parents and I .
__label__noemo	Yes , I am . I'd like to be able to get around a little more .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , is there a swimming pool in your hotel ?
__label__joy	Oh , that ’ s interesting , and but what kind of things ?
__label__joy	My god , it's such a lovely lake ! The lake has a water surface of 56 square kilometers .
__label__noemo	Thank you , Mr . Smith .
__label__surprise	Linda ? Is that you ? I haven't seen you in ages !
__label__noemo	By the way , we also have some good red wine and white wine , such as Great Wall White Wine .
__label__noemo	I see . So our current policies are encouraging sick people to come to work , resulting in more sick employees .
__label__noemo	He died of lung cancer , right ?
__label__noemo	About the same . But I'm looking for a job , so I have to answer the phone often .
__label__noemo	That's right . All my guests , attention please . We will have half an hour to visit the spring and take photos . And next spot will be the Moon Reflected in Three Pools .
__label__noemo	Hum ... I say 5 500 yuan . That's as cheap as it can get .
__label__anger	It's really frustrating , isn't it ? I have the same problem . I would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable . With the way the dollar plummeting lately , my securities have gone up in smoke .
__label__noemo	Right , I see . It all sounds pretty complicated to me . I think I'm going to need some more time to think about this and make a decision as to what I want to do .
__label__noemo	Would you care for a cup of tea before your meal ?
__label__noemo	Have you ever tried shopping online ?
__label__joy	It's the truth . I am really happy .
__label__noemo	Thanks . I'm sorry to say that you need to get this stamped . There is no stamp on this slip and it is essential before I can process it for you .
__label__noemo	Alright . Have you been to see a doctor ?
__label__noemo	Is it really worth paying for ?
__label__noemo	Yes , at your company , I think . I'm Frank .
__label__noemo	I'm like that too . I like to invite friends over sometimes , but I don't want to have lots of crazy parties at the apartment .
__label__joy	You are welcome .
__label__noemo	I don't know . There ’ s plenty of fish out there in the sea !
__label__disgust	That ’ s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather .
__label__noemo	Yes . May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Do you have a lot of clothes that need to be washed ?
__label__noemo	that'd be great . What kind of camera do you have ?
__label__noemo	Nice to meet you .
__label__noemo	Very good . Ok , Mr . Brown , I'm now totally satisfied with your packing . You can execute our first order now , and I will open the L / C immediately after I return to Taipei .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . This bus goes downtown , doesn't it ?
__label__noemo	Yes , the pain comes more intense when the weather is bad . And the pain comes intense when I walk too much .
__label__noemo	Yeah . we never do that in a public office .
__label__joy	Yeah , we would have been lost without the help of the locals .
__label__noemo	Then I guess you get to have a pet . Do you know what you want ?
__label__noemo	How do you do , Mr . Johnson ? I'm Thomas .
__label__joy	Yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams !
__label__noemo	Good morning .
__label__noemo	Sure . 7,000 yuan per month .
__label__noemo	How about this floor lamp ?
__label__noemo	We have a few different wholesale vendors , so our cost varies a bit over the fiscal year . But the difference is miniscule , a fluctuation of about 0.2 % .
__label__noemo	Are you sure of that ?
__label__noemo	Mm . All my children hope to go to college . Right ?
__label__noemo	Give me some time to think about it .
__label__noemo	No , can you tell me about it ?
__label__noemo	Fine , I ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday .
__label__joy	Maria sings like a lark , doesn't she ?
__label__surprise	Oh , there Isn't ? Oh , no .
__label__noemo	Do you know that Mary an Ben have already separated ?
__label__noemo	How much are the late fees ?
__label__noemo	You will be busier , right ?
__label__noemo	The memo went out three days ago . It should have made it to your in-box , but maybe it got lost in all the clutter on your desk .
__label__noemo	Today is June 18 , isn ’ t it ?
__label__noemo	She might like a laptop computer .
__label__noemo	Before we draft the contract , let's examine the details .
__label__noemo	I'm a little nervous !
__label__noemo	Would you like anything else ?
__label__joy	Have a nice flight back , and take care . Thanks for your call .
__label__noemo	That's coincidence 。
__label__noemo	I mean you couldn't give it up !
__label__noemo	I wish the same . As such , I hope you will seriously consider a pay increase .
__label__noemo	Good answer , B - good answer ! Seriously , though , are you interested in staying in a staff-level position , or would you hope to move into management someday ?
__label__noemo	Anything else ?
__label__noemo	How come ?
__label__noemo	But I heard the north of China are experiencing severe sandstorms !
__label__joy	Don't be so frightened . It's just a skill .
__label__noemo	Well , I ’ m a college student.How about you ?
__label__noemo	It certainly is .
__label__noemo	Are they genuine ?
__label__noemo	Well , I don't know .
__label__joy	Sure . It's on you right ?
__label__noemo	Shall we sign this contract now ?
__label__noemo	Well , this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . I suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . That way you can play games online without any lag . This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free !
__label__noemo	Hey ! How was your first day of class ? I ’ m in level two and I ’ m loving my class this semester ! It ’ s great being in a class of international students !
__label__noemo	Well , I guess on Friday , then you can eat .
__label__noemo	ok . I should have it finished by Friday afternoon . Then I can check those account over the weekend . We need to have them finished by Monday , right ?
__label__noemo	Really ? I am surprised . He doesn't look like a guy who'd ever cheat on his wife , does he ?
__label__noemo	I wish it would cool off one day .
__label__noemo	Three twenty-five cent stamps , please .
__label__noemo	Can she call you back ? She is about to start a meeting .
__label__noemo	anyway , how was your such , Catherine ?
__label__noemo	Hello . Yes , I'm here to redeem a Treasury Note . It's not at the maturity date yet , but it is an emergency .
__label__joy	Ok . I like fishing very much .
__label__noemo	It's always warm in September and October . It's often cold in November and it rains sometimes .
__label__surprise	This Olympic park is so big !
__label__noemo	Yes , it did . The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
__label__noemo	No , mom . Piano is for girls .
__label__noemo	Yes , I am , thank you . I'll have three scrambled eggs with country ham , toast and jam , please .
__label__joy	Wow . That's wonderful .
__label__joy	Thank you . I've got just 50 minutes to go . Can we manage ?
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__noemo	But it's a waste of money . You won't really run in them ! You don't need such a shoe to use exercise machines . It's just a waste of money .
__label__noemo	Eighteen.Some friends are having a birthday party for me tonight.Do you want to come ?
__label__noemo	You can be assured of it .
__label__noemo	Where is Stanley ? It was his idea to have the bachelor's party at a ETV , wasn't it ?
__label__noemo	Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ?
__label__noemo	Now you don't have the butterflies in your stomach , do you ?
__label__noemo	Yes , two of us .
__label__noemo	Is there anything else ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I did .
__label__noemo	OK , Mr . Wang , here is your bill . The total amount is US $ 120 .
__label__noemo	How does this afternoon at 2:30 sound to you ?
__label__noemo	So , you're going to use Sarah's car to go cruising for chicks ?
__label__noemo	Perrier , Jim Beam , apples , and grape juice . It will all be there shortly , sir .
__label__noemo	How much is it a pound ?
__label__joy	I know a good place to hire bikes if you want .
__label__joy	So , what do you want to do ?
__label__noemo	and what if it doesn't work out , right ?
__label__noemo	Are you sure this is the right restaurant ?
__label__noemo	morning , Mr . Emory . I was hoping to set up an appointment with you for sometime this week .
__label__noemo	Go right ahead .
__label__noemo	What kind of toothbrush do you use ?
__label__noemo	I am sorry but I ordered sole not the same as the others . Will you change it ?
__label__noemo	Thank you , sir ... Here is your change . Could you check it , please ? Thank you for choosing our hotel . I hope you enjoyed your stay .
__label__noemo	James is going to be packed off there .
__label__joy	Great ! Do you know someone else who is also looking for an apartment ?
__label__noemo	That's reasonable . Will you take care of meals for the day ?
__label__noemo	You can buy things at post office that were never sold there before . You can buy sweets and chocolates , newspapers , birthday and Christmas cards ...
__label__noemo	About what ?
__label__noemo	Don't worry . I'm also sitting next to you .
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__noemo	My birthplace is Yentai .
__label__noemo	This is Kevin .
__label__noemo	At the Beijing Olympics , all four table tennis events were all-Chinese finals . A clean sweep again !
__label__noemo	I'm Mary Kell . May I ask your name ?
__label__noemo	Did you go to the concert last weekend ?
__label__noemo	That's trail mix !
__label__noemo	You don't have to do that ...
__label__noemo	everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	I think the cloisonn bracelet is more beautiful .
__label__noemo	Call me Mr . Smith .
__label__noemo	Oh , you see , we are on the 8th floor , and moving into the 6th floor in another building . It is about 15 kilometers to get there .
__label__noemo	Ok , the total would be $ 367 and 65 cents.How would you pay ?
__label__noemo	I have the same question . I can ’ t send out mails . We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately .
__label__noemo	Certainly , sir .
__label__noemo	What kind of flowers do you want ?
__label__noemo	That's right .
__label__joy	Thanks . I'm flattered .
__label__noemo	I got married not long ago and we are expecting our first child . I'd like to buy a car for the family .
__label__noemo	Well , it's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . So , unfortunately you'll lose this 50 RIB . We'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .
__label__noemo	I'll do with the cake .
__label__noemo	Do you enjoy working in this office ?
__label__noemo	Well , I see .
__label__anger	It's terrible how things have changed.You remember there used to be trees on all these hills .
__label__noemo	Only ten percent of taxes included in the bill .
__label__noemo	The shoulder .
__label__noemo	Thanks .
__label__noemo	I hope you haven ’ t invited any vegetarians .
__label__noemo	I am , too !
__label__noemo	Is there anything valuable in it ?
__label__surprise	Gosh !
__label__noemo	Good afternoon Sir , may I please see your passport and reservation ?
__label__noemo	From 7 to 9 o'clock .
__label__noemo	Everybody is buying them .
__label__noemo	Really ? I'm in a hurry . All right .
__label__noemo	What kind of magazines would you like , fashion or sports ?
__label__noemo	What's the room rate ? It's little expensive for me.Do you have any other room ?
__label__noemo	No , mom , I can manage it by myself . His help just causes more trouble .
__label__noemo	Well , California ’ s changed over the last little while.You should come back out sometime .
__label__noemo	Oh , that ’ s such a relief . I didn ’ t want the payment to be overdue . Thank you so much .
__label__noemo	The classes have him out of the office , so that is stressful for him . But as far as homework goes , it is a breeze for him .
__label__noemo	Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we can accept . When I suggested we meet each other half way , I meant it literally .
__label__joy	sure , but you really did great and outperformed the others . You deserved it !
__label__noemo	What's wrong with you ?
__label__joy	Wow , you are going to be busy this semester ! Okay , here you go . You are registered now . you ’ ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start .
__label__noemo	Yes , certainly . I'll be back in a minute . Here you are
__label__noemo	Don ’ t you know they have had little affection for each other ?
__label__joy	Sure . The main courses are roast Beijing duck and fried eel slices .
__label__joy	Good , I like it .
__label__noemo	Let's have a look . What is this ? Where are all the grades ?
__label__noemo	Your BAC exceeds the legal limit .
__label__noemo	Thank you , Miss Kelly .
__label__noemo	Do you want a taxi ?
__label__noemo	What is it like living in on-campus housing ?
__label__joy	Sounds OK to me . I like movies . Hey , Joanna , look - there are a lot of decent-looking guys here . And the club jackets - they're really hot ! I think we made the right choice !
__label__noemo	Yes , that's true . Still , it's hard to believe . Yesterday our high was only 50 degrees Fahrenheit .
__label__surprise	I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan ?
__label__noemo	Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .
__label__noemo	I think you need to get brain surgery . I honestly don ’ t think you need cosmetic surgery.You look amazing .
__label__noemo	Do you have any ketchup ?
__label__noemo	I know that Frenchmen installed the Bungee cord between two tall buildings .
__label__noemo	I have no idea where to get it from .
__label__joy	Sure , which beach are we going to ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I ’ m looking for a winter jacket .
__label__noemo	I think so ; hurry up and get off .
__label__noemo	Thank you for telling me that .
__label__noemo	I heard about a software program called turbid . It automatically submits a bid with just a few seconds to go in an auction .
__label__joy	There , ... we're about done .
__label__fear	It always hurts . I hate going .
__label__noemo	My daughter . She is missing . I don ’ t know where she is .
__label__noemo	Say , how would you like to be a dress designer ?
__label__noemo	I met her about one year ago .
__label__noemo	You don't have to explain . Suit yourself .
__label__noemo	Yes . Are you traveling here ?
__label__noemo	I'm quite upset ! I want a new room and a refund for tonight .
__label__noemo	There was something wrong with the plane last Thursday .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes.What do you recommend today ?
__label__noemo	I like taking photos out of door .
__label__noemo	There are shills . A shill is someone who bids up the price of their own sale .
__label__joy	Thank you so much .
__label__noemo	Here they are .
__label__noemo	Yes , but now we are fresh out of staff quarters .
__label__noemo	Thank you . Now I know how to travel by air .
__label__noemo	OK , It's here , one of the best makes in China .
__label__noemo	Do you want large ones or small ones ?
__label__noemo	He is more nice than wise .
__label__noemo	A new film is on.Have you ever seen it ?
__label__noemo	Hi , Alice.How are you ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me . would you lend me some wreckers
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . I think 90 days is more than enough time .
__label__noemo	I think these patterns are quite good . Can you give me a price indication of these ?
__label__anger	It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !
__label__noemo	How much did it cost you ?
__label__noemo	All right . No problem . What ’ s your extension ?
__label__noemo	Does a warranty come with this music box ?
__label__noemo	OK . Please fill in these forms and take them back when you are done .
__label__joy	I will help to prepare food , feed animals and clean up . I ’ m very excited about it now .
__label__noemo	She is a young man !
__label__noemo	I want games that are all luck .
__label__noemo	I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time .
__label__noemo	You better do some exercise every morning .
__label__noemo	No , I'm from the north . I was born in Beijing , actually .
__label__noemo	We could contact alumni who work for large , well-know companies . They might be able to arrange cheap advertising in exchange for some free tickets .
__label__noemo	You ’ re welcome .
__label__noemo	Okay , here are the graphs and figures for this month's sales . Let's review them all together .
__label__noemo	I was told about it already . I'm just waiting for my invitation .
__label__noemo	Business couldn't be better .
__label__noemo	Yes , we don ’ t want everyone to burn their mouths and have a drink gallons.of water.Ok , I ’ m really to do the meat.Should I cook it over a low flame ?
__label__noemo	Well , it would give me a chance to grow , but I am wondering if I would like the job .
__label__noemo	Oh , no . It's already February 5th .
__label__noemo	Yes , I have . I tried once when I visited your country last year . I think they were very tasty . Can you cook them ?
__label__noemo	Tell me what happened .
__label__noemo	no , I prefer to play with people I know .
__label__noemo	That's correct , Sir . The bank will issue receipt to you and also take care of all the pledged securities .
__label__noemo	Just the necessities
__label__noemo	John Anderson .
__label__noemo	And that ?
__label__surprise	Really ? I'll have a try . Maybe I will get high marks next time .
__label__noemo	Here's your key , sir . Room number 1405.The bellboy will take your luggage to your room . Have a pleasant stay !
__label__noemo	Yeah , they have all the machines , a pool , and a steam room and sauna .
__label__noemo	Well , what about $ 70 with a scarf ?
__label__noemo	That's Ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much .
__label__noemo	Moreover , it's easy to clean , right ? You are really lazy .
__label__noemo	they're not actually that bad . They could be worse . What do you think about it ?
__label__noemo	Yes , but you will have to confirm this reservation at least two hours before departure time .
__label__noemo	I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions .
__label__noemo	Can you ship this batch of cotton within five or six weeks ?
__label__noemo	Hi , Peter ! How are you ?
__label__noemo	Why did you select your college ?
__label__noemo	One slight problem , sir . I need to charge you $ 2 to remove this error from your file .
__label__noemo	We really believe that you are a highly qualified person . But the other candidate has several years of related experiences .
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . By the way , is tender-opening done publicly ?
__label__noemo	Hello , Is this room service ?
__label__noemo	Mmmm ... 2 years does seem like a long time . How about the interest if I save for 6 months ?
__label__noemo	I left it two months ago . I didn't think I could learn much there , and there were not many opportunities for self-development .
__label__noemo	That's how I feel , I want winter to come soon .
__label__noemo	Maybe I've got a higher EQ . I'm not sure .
__label__noemo	shouldn't we make an appointment first ?
__label__noemo	You are right , I guess.The world keeps changing , and so do families . But I like a small-sized or medium-sized family where everybody is equal to everybody else . That's what I want .
__label__noemo	We are very glad to hear that . We are sure that there will be a bigger market for our products in this country .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , where is the nearest bank ?
__label__noemo	What is your salary at present ?
__label__noemo	Thanks . Then may I suggest that you put down in the contract ' shipment on September 15 or earlier ' ?
__label__anger	Hey . Why did you take that money ? You are such a cheater ! I should send you to jail !
__label__noemo	You must have a wonderful time .
__label__joy	Anything for you .
__label__noemo	I think I'll have a glass of wine .
__label__noemo	Our Investment Financing Service will help you choose where to put your funds and look at both the pros and cons of each .
__label__joy	Yes , Florida had great weather while we were there . You look tan , too . Did you go somewhere ?
__label__noemo	Well , I know you do the right thing .
__label__noemo	How long will it take for our order to be delivered ?
__label__noemo	Look at that cylindrical office building . I ’ Ve never been seen one that shape before .
__label__noemo	Where do they come from ?
__label__noemo	Poor Kevin , we should do something for him . He is a nice guy and does his job well .
__label__noemo	Do you have a moment ?
__label__noemo	I don ’ t mind , but I like girls with long hair .
__label__noemo	Not bad , thanks ! Our company has sent me to pick you up here .
__label__joy	My children would like that ; they like dancing very much .
__label__noemo	I just can't bear it that Emily made me feel like a baby who always pigs out on junk food .
__label__noemo	They must have just come back from tomb sweeping because today is Tomb Sweeping Day .
__label__noemo	Next week , so I thought it was better to get this all sorted out as soon as possible .
__label__noemo	That ’ s fine . You shouldn ’ t make a hasty decision when choosing a pet .
__label__noemo	Don't worry . We'll just get a doggie bag .
__label__noemo	I ’ m a new student in the school . My name ’ s John .
__label__noemo	This is Sun , and I interviewed with you yesterday .
__label__noemo	How did you get that job ?
__label__noemo	I'll have the potatoes . What are you having ?
__label__noemo	The van will be driven by Mary and me .
__label__noemo	I've never taken this bus , but I think it's the right one .
__label__joy	The situation differs in person .
__label__joy	Thank you !
__label__noemo	Good morning , sir . Are you Mr . Wang , the personnel manager ?
__label__noemo	I ’ ll show you where to find your article .
__label__noemo	Hello , Janet .
__label__joy	That's interesting . So why did you become a hairdresser ?
__label__noemo	Oh you ’ re so kind !
__label__noemo	Table tennis .
__label__anger	He treats everyone pretty badly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake !
__label__noemo	Hopefully !
__label__noemo	Hello , BCD Company , can I help you ?
__label__noemo	They do . Once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . It's only a two-seater , you know !
__label__joy	Ok , thank you for your time and patience .
__label__noemo	Yeah , they are my wife's heaven , but not mine . I always get lost in the supermarket .
__label__noemo	Did you come late ?
__label__noemo	Would you please mail these letters , Lucy ?
__label__joy	We are all very proud of you .
__label__noemo	All right , do you want to sign a nine-month or a one-year lease ?
__label__noemo	Yeah but , how did this holiday come to be ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I am . When is the wedding ?
__label__noemo	Mom ?
__label__joy	Great , thanks a lot .
__label__noemo	Ah ! Not on me ! Ow !
__label__noemo	Frankly , he is more well-behaved than you .
__label__joy	There ’ s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ’ t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your
__label__noemo	Would you like another bigger one ?
__label__noemo	How do you find studying a language on the internet ?
__label__noemo	Yes , but whom to ?
__label__noemo	Yeah . If we share the cab , it'll be cheaper . Besides that your Chinese is better than mine . The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully .
__label__noemo	No problem , Rod . I won't play too hard .
__label__joy	That may be true , but I'm sure you enjoyed your sandwich .
__label__noemo	It's very convenient and it has become popular recently .
__label__noemo	Yes . I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on .
__label__noemo	What's the problem with Sons ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m not sure .
__label__noemo	That's true .
__label__noemo	So how have you been lately ?
__label__noemo	Pretty good , thank you . And you ?
__label__noemo	Jimmy , I ’ d like to wear this robe for tonight cocktail party . What do you think of it ?
__label__noemo	yes . Should we go there by bus so we aren't late ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s fabulous . Thank you .
__label__noemo	Where ’ s yours at ?
__label__noemo	DENY ? That's very expensive in America . It costs nearly $ 70 for only 50ml .
__label__noemo	I want this letter registered . There is something valuable inside .
__label__noemo	That might not be ideal because there would be some drawbacks to an annual contract situation that might make it difficult to sell to our buyers . What about free delivery ? If we make a large enough order , could you waive the deliver fee ?
__label__noemo	Well , yes . I don't mind admitting that I am . I enjoyed school , but I did object to having to go in every day once we've done all our exams .
__label__noemo	That would be great .
__label__noemo	Where are you going ?
__label__noemo	Of course . That's what we deserve .
__label__noemo	yeah . we never do that in a public office .
__label__joy	No problem . See you !
__label__noemo	She is a beautiful bride .
__label__noemo	It ’ s not that bad , besides it really looks nice in that corner . It gives the room a good atmosphere .
__label__noemo	No , I will stay another day.my boss will get over it . Would you like to meet me for lunch tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	One isn ’ t necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers .
__label__noemo	I think I might have a dahl .
__label__noemo	I am sorry , ma ’ am . Our general manager is not in town . But I ’ d be more than glad to get you our assistant manager , if you like . But I am afraid that he will say the same thing . We have very clear instructions about valuables and we must follow them . And now if you will excuse me , I'll go and find our assistant manager for you .
__label__noemo	I was taught in high school how to draw and paint .
__label__sadness	My uncle passed away last night .
__label__noemo	I ’ m interested in teaching at your school .
__label__disgust	Well , I hope you can find something else to be passionate about .
__label__noemo	What's your favorite movie ?
__label__noemo	I see . How long does it take you to reach the office every day ?
__label__noemo	No . As far as I can remember he was supposed to be on a business trip to Lisbon .
__label__noemo	I really just have two problems with this .
__label__surprise	You can ’ t be serious !
__label__noemo	yes . Which one is the brake again ?
__label__noemo	I think I'll have a beer .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll take this one .
__label__joy	oath ... that makes so much more sense ! Ha-ha . Well , great , I don't like German food anyway !
__label__noemo	That leak is going to raise my water bill .
__label__noemo	Should I do anything else ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s all for today .
__label__noemo	excuse me while I go and get that .
__label__noemo	what did you do over the weekend ?
__label__surprise	20 to 1 , in favour of the Cougars !
__label__noemo	Well , it is different in different countries.But it's because of the high tax that buying liquor duty-free is such a good deal .
__label__noemo	You are interested in other people ’ s business , aren ’ t you ?
__label__joy	It was fantastic ! We had such a good time . The only problem was that because it was their high season , we spent hours queuing .
__label__noemo	This is good to go . If she wants accessories , just visit us again .
__label__noemo	Yes , we are just looking for one . What's the charge per day ?
__label__joy	I like Chinese food , too . I like dumplings best .
__label__noemo	Look , we need to have the Stars.com account , right ?
__label__noemo	What is your policy on returns ?
__label__noemo	Yes , they were . But it has already past . The traffic from the airport to downtown has been relieved after the completion of Yan'an Aerial Road .
__label__noemo	I must have slept right through it .
__label__noemo	What does that mean ?
__label__noemo	Fever and a bad cough .
__label__noemo	Fine .
__label__joy	I'm sure it is wonderful , but I need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
__label__noemo	Where do you work , Andrea ?
__label__noemo	All right . But you have to clean up everything it messes up .
__label__noemo	So , you know how to drive , right ?
__label__noemo	Well , would you please send someone to 502 ? I have some clothes to wash .
__label__noemo	it ’ s a very quiet neighbourhood . There ’ s some traffic , but not much . It ’ s not very difficult to get to the city centre , but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or yo
__label__noemo	Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
__label__noemo	Just fine , and you ?
__label__noemo	Are you in a hurry ?
__label__noemo	Not really . To be honest , it's very cheap . I only spent $ 100 .
__label__noemo	Oh no , thank you . We aren't all that thirsty .
__label__noemo	I'm not sure when it started . But I know it's older than me . As a young boy , I used to eat here a lot .
__label__noemo	I need to check these books out .
__label__noemo	Turn right outside the school ; go along until you come to the main road ; turn left ; go straight ahead , straight on at the roundabout , down the hill , and turn left at the bottom .
__label__noemo	Don't worry about it .
__label__joy	Yes . I miss you very much .
__label__noemo	The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here !
__label__noemo	Yes , I ’ m off to the department store . I must buy some furniture for my new flat .
__label__noemo	Hi . I ’ m calling from Room 209 . I couldn ’ t find the TV Guide . Can you send me one , please ?
__label__noemo	We should take a packed lunch on the journey . The food they sell on the trains is always expensive .
__label__joy	A pleasure meeting you as well , the flowers are for you .
__label__noemo	no way . I will be scared out of my wits .
__label__joy	Um , that ’ s good .
__label__noemo	I want to go there , too . Can I ?
__label__noemo	Do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation ?
__label__noemo	Are you aware that you drove through a red light ?
__label__noemo	You can't go down on the price .
__label__joy	What a beautiful view , my sweetheart !
__label__noemo	Do you have a fever ?
__label__noemo	Really , John . I still think you should go to a doctor . You've been sneezing ever since you entered the office this morning . Why don't you take this afternoon off ? If you don't want to see a doctor , at least you can go home and have a good rest .
__label__joy	Very nice . Thank you for your time .
__label__noemo	I'm sure he was off-side .
__label__joy	Well , shall we go to the cinema ?
__label__joy	It's a romantic meeting . I can say that a hero saves a beauty .
__label__noemo	Yeah , yeah , it was really interesting . You know , I'm in a bit of a hurry , but here ’ s my card . We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion .
__label__sadness	it ’ s too bad I did all that shopping yesterday !
__label__noemo	Sure . Let me look over them and I ’ ll bring them back this afternoon .
__label__surprise	Are you kidding ? I always get up late . Oh , my God . Can't believe that . That is terrible .
__label__noemo	That ’ s still more than I wanted to spend . What if I take both dresses ?
__label__noemo	No , but this is an emergency ! Please !
__label__noemo	In Taichung , I think .
__label__noemo	Good morning , everyone . Let me introduce myself to you ...
__label__noemo	It ’ ll take about 20 minutes .
__label__noemo	They are not feeling satisfied ?
__label__noemo	Where do we submit the tender ?
__label__noemo	I'd like a hamburger with lettuce and tomato .
__label__noemo	Who's it for ?
__label__noemo	A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ?
__label__noemo	The crab soup is quite delicious.It ' s always a favorite with our customers .
__label__noemo	That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .
__label__surprise	Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ?
__label__noemo	It's very kind of you to say so . How about changing another one for you ?
__label__noemo	Sure , did you receive the sample we sent last week ?
__label__noemo	Only three days on business so I won't have a long time .
__label__noemo	Yes , he married my sister ten years ago .
__label__noemo	Miss !
__label__noemo	He just has his secretary do his homework for him .
__label__noemo	Lots . Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years .
__label__noemo	You'll find our prices very favorable .
__label__noemo	But let me tell you , you're doing just fine . I couldn't do half as well as you do when I was learning German . By the way , how long have you been learning English ?
__label__noemo	But I don't know how to work the Microsoft Words . Could you please give me a hand ?
__label__noemo	That is a good idea to start with . I also think the mass media is also a good approach for advertising .
__label__noemo	Yes , but to the heath , this break has long enough .
__label__joy	Thank you , dear . I feel better now .
__label__noemo	We are short of staff today .
__label__noemo	The Grand Hotel ?
__label__noemo	We would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse .
__label__noemo	Who will be your supporter during your stay in the States ?
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__joy	Ok . I'll call you Saturday morning .
__label__noemo	How old is the house then ?
__label__noemo	Are you all right ?
__label__joy	No , thanks .
__label__noemo	Could you please look over these resumes ? They ’ Ve just come in .
__label__noemo	I may have something on that day , but thanks for inviting me .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I do . I guess I'm a real fitness freak .
__label__noemo	All right . How about this one ?
__label__noemo	Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry that I'm late . I couldn't find the room .
__label__noemo	I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .
__label__noemo	Please wait a moment . I'll make out the duty memo . Here you are . Take this and pay the people over there .
__label__noemo	Mmm , I like it . How much is it ?
__label__noemo	Not at all . She's actually very athletic .
__label__noemo	So does my father . I'm already used to it .
__label__noemo	Does it bother you when you eat something really cold ?
__label__noemo	Model of computers aren't compatible ?
__label__noemo	Sure . Our special wine today is a 1989 Chardonnay .
__label__noemo	No . you ’ re going the wrong way . You wanna 103 from the Beijing zoo .
__label__noemo	Sure . I'm really sorry for the trouble I've made .
__label__noemo	Will it take long ?
__label__noemo	You'd get plenty of sleep for you work so hard .
__label__joy	Let me see . Yes , that's it . Where did you find it ?
__label__noemo	Good day . Welcome to IBA , what can I assist you with today ?
__label__noemo	do you think you studied enough for the exam ?
__label__noemo	So , I don ’ t have to pay any of it ?
__label__joy	Thank you so much .
__label__joy	I haven't read a book like that for as long as I can remember .
__label__noemo	Your office called and said that the owners had made a counter-offer to my offer to purchase their house .
__label__noemo	Er , may I know how much I will be paid monthly ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it ’ s right .
__label__noemo	So tell me about it !
__label__joy	Thanks , I appreciate that !
__label__sadness	I'm sorry . These batteries are not on sale .
__label__noemo	Who's playing ?
__label__noemo	good afternoon , madam . How can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Don't worry about that . He said I can do that at spare time . Anyway , it's just a part-time job .
__label__noemo	Sure . The fitting room is over there .
__label__noemo	It ’ s challenging , I feel I have learned a lot .
__label__joy	It looks good . OK . I'll take it .
__label__noemo	What a jerk . He doesn't deserve you .
__label__joy	I will . Thank you , Mummy .
__label__noemo	I ’ m afraid I ’ m a poor talker . I ’ m not comfortable talking with the people whom I have just met for the first time . That is not very good for business , so I have been studying public speaking .
__label__noemo	Let's go then .
__label__noemo	David , I am going for an interview tomorrow . It's an American company . Can you give me an idea of what the interviewer will ask ?
__label__noemo	Yes . We charge 50 cents for iced water .
__label__noemo	Do you have any experience using weights ?
__label__noemo	They are beautiful , but I can't understand the connotation in them . Let me see the handkerchiefs .
__label__noemo	Of course , I am sure .
__label__noemo	It is already 10:25 .
__label__noemo	Oh don ’ t worry , sweetie , I didn ’ t know when you were going to propose . It was still a nice surprise ! As I was saying , I ’ Ve got it all planned out . There ’ s almost nothing left to do ! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending .
__label__noemo	I ’ m afraid I never go for a holiday . It ’ s always business .
__label__noemo	Just walk down the road for a few minutes , and you'll find it on your right .
__label__noemo	That could explain all his stomachaches . He's trying to hide it from us .
__label__noemo	Where are you staying ?
__label__noemo	Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ?
__label__noemo	Do you also believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy ?
__label__noemo	Well , to come straight to the point , could you tell us something about your new price ?
__label__joy	Yes , thank you very much .
__label__noemo	For the past 3 years , I have been working in China East Airlines Corporation Limited . I'm very tolerant of people and have been told that this is one of my strengths . I feel I have a lot to offer as a team member .
__label__joy	You made a good choice , then ?
__label__joy	Thank you . Please have a cup of tea .
__label__noemo	You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous .
__label__surprise	Fine . Give me the ticket .
__label__noemo	If I were a manager , I would have a private talk with this employ to figure out the reasons . It is very important to have this one-to-one discussion in an unthreatening situation without any distraction .
__label__joy	Sure , when ?
__label__noemo	Problems are inevitable .
__label__noemo	I've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . I wonder how you managed to achieve such success ?
__label__noemo	How much ?
__label__noemo	Ok . You're right . She's a psycho .
__label__noemo	Well , I just came in . I worked overtime yesterday . Some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate . So I stayed to double check them . The boss was aware of my very late work of last night . So before he left office , he told me I could come one hour later this morning .
__label__noemo	Just make sure children don ’ t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers .
__label__noemo	Hmm . It's very cold today.But I brought my jacket . Maybe it will be alright to wait .
__label__noemo	When will your vacation end ?
__label__noemo	Yes , that's exactly it . How much tip shall we give the waiter ?
__label__noemo	Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard .
__label__noemo	Really , Mr . Brown ? Did you find anything interesting ?
__label__joy	That's a good suggestion . It's fine today . Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . It must be fantastic .
__label__noemo	Can you see a Post Office somewhere around here ?
__label__noemo	You're getting that hot stuff in my mild broth !
__label__noemo	I'm not sure where they sell bus passes at .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__joy	Wow , so you'll be out thirty dollars on your first week at work !
__label__noemo	Me , too . I want to be a volunteer for 2008 Beijing Olympics .
__label__noemo	Well , I ’ Ve looked over your resume , Mr . Peepers .
__label__noemo	What are spring and autumn like ?
__label__noemo	Oh , thank you .
__label__noemo	OK . Thank you very much for telling me all these things .
__label__surprise	Really ? You are so kind .
__label__noemo	Betty and I will throw a dinner party this weekend , we ’ d like you to come .
__label__noemo	How long have you been washing clothes here ?
__label__noemo	Perhaps people should stop eating animals . We could grow more crops .
__label__noemo	Certainly , sir .
__label__noemo	Hello , this is Catherine . I am calling about the appointment with Mr . Liu for this afternoon . Something has just come up . I am afraid the appointment will have to be rescheduled . I am very sorry about the change .
__label__noemo	I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films .
__label__noemo	That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus .
__label__noemo	Does it say how much they are asking for this house ?
__label__noemo	Shall we have some soup first ?
__label__noemo	Won't you watch TV ?
__label__noemo	What's the matter ?
__label__noemo	Yes , but did you remember ? You need good notes to help you remember .
__label__joy	Yeah , it will be fun ! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . I also have a revolver that ’ s really fun too ! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you
__label__noemo	Why are you asking me about my boyfriend ?
__label__noemo	Have you thought of moving at all , Sarah ?
__label__noemo	Ice cream , fresh fruit or chocolate cake .
__label__noemo	Dark brown , if you have it .
__label__noemo	Yes . There are selected itineraries for rich and high-tasted people , common routine for people who are on trade observation tour , and excursion routine for people who have limited time for sightseeing .
__label__noemo	Hi , Zina . I had a feeling you'd be stopping by .
__label__noemo	You're not looking happy.What ' s the matter ?
__label__noemo	But the sale number is close to the predicted amount .
__label__joy	Oh , I love you too !
__label__noemo	Yes . We usually send technicians abroad to offer after-sales service to our customers .
__label__joy	Oh , Amy . I am the luckiest guy in the world .
__label__noemo	And hopefully they are going to confirm the deal on Wednesday , fingers crossed .
__label__noemo	Many people like the dancing figures . Two of our boxes have the figures .
__label__noemo	Hi , Sara , what are you reading ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to reserve a table for two , my wife and I .
__label__noemo	This one here .
__label__noemo	What can I do for you today ?
__label__surprise	You didn ’ t ?
__label__noemo	Okay , it'll be ready in two minutes .
__label__anger	What did I do ? I haven't done anything .
__label__noemo	Thank you . Good evening , Mr.Dean .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , but I'm not feeling too well . I think I'm going to throw up .
__label__noemo	B , what's in your hand ?
__label__noemo	It was Professor Johnson .
__label__noemo	If you get on before 4 p . m . or after 6 p . m . there is saver return which is $ 9.45 , an ordinary return is $ 16.45 .
__label__sadness	I ’ m sorry . We don't haven any .
__label__noemo	Yes indeed . It has a very strict inspection so it takes a pretty long Be for everyone .
__label__noemo	Let me have a look at your boarding pass . It's E - 6 , the sixth seat by the aisle .
__label__noemo	Don't be so nervous ! Relax ! First , sleep early at night . Second , study two hours a day after school . Third , don't tire yourself out , but don't be lazy . Will that help ?
__label__noemo	One Yuan .
__label__noemo	I'll take the Citroen C2 . What is the rate for the car per day ?
__label__joy	I really like the Jacuzzi bathtub in the bathroom .
__label__noemo	Swimming in summer and skating in winter.What ' s your favorite sport ?
__label__noemo	The fitting rooms are over there .
__label__noemo	I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class .
__label__noemo	Good morning , Miss White . You are half an hour early .
__label__noemo	No , if you take some care when you use them .
__label__noemo	Yes ?
__label__noemo	I ’ d like to a glass of tomato juice please .
__label__noemo	Do you like tea ?
__label__noemo	no , that's OK . You know what they say when in Rome ...
__label__noemo	What was that like ?
__label__noemo	An ordinary one will do.Would you put me under a hot dryer after that ? I'm in a hurry .
__label__joy	Happy birthday , Peter , and many happy returns of the day . Here's a present for you .
__label__noemo	A visitor .
__label__joy	I'm sure your wife will love them .
__label__joy	Ok . See you soon .
__label__noemo	That's not very easy to say .
__label__noemo	These books are due back in two weeks .
__label__joy	I had a good time . You seem to be in a hurry . Don't let me hold you up .
__label__noemo	And that'll be 10:15 p . m . Taipei time .
__label__noemo	Good morning . This is Dr . Mustn ’ s Office . Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	A B plus .
__label__noemo	Yes , madam . There's one in the seat pocket . Here you are .
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry . I ’ m not interested in it .
__label__noemo	I have three years of teaching ESL and four years of teaching per-school children .
__label__noemo	How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ?
__label__noemo	It says a storm may come tomorrow .
__label__noemo	160 yuan .
__label__noemo	He's a captain .
__label__noemo	How often do you play tennis ?
__label__noemo	250 Yuan .
__label__joy	Merry Christmas to you !
__label__noemo	The next beginning class starts on October 25th .
__label__noemo	Why are you feeling depressed ?
__label__noemo	What style ?
__label__noemo	Hello ?
__label__noemo	Good morning . I would like to make a reservation to Hong Kong for August 2 .
__label__noemo	Could you tell me about your work experience ?
__label__noemo	On your account there is no limit to over the counter withdrawals , it won't cause a problem . Here's your money , 10,000 RIB . Please count it before you leave .
__label__noemo	Even though the traffic is bumper-to-bumper out there , I don't think it's heavy traffic that makes Bill late . He takes the train , remember ?
__label__noemo	No , you do not have to . The handbag can be taken with you . There is the cart at the entrance .
__label__noemo	oh , we had to break up because she didn't want to float around in Beijing . She insisted on working in her hometown and having a stable life .
__label__noemo	The chicken breasts cost $ 4.05 per pound .
__label__noemo	I know , and we've been on the bus forever .
__label__noemo	You get off at the next stop , cross the street , and you'll find the stop not far on the right hand side .
__label__noemo	I love them all . But if I had to name one as the best , I would say it's the ending .
__label__noemo	I think she is in her room putting a little something together for you to take to school with you .
__label__noemo	Yes , I went to the Than He Sports Center for the football match last Sunday .
__label__noemo	Yes and no ... We can't ask for a show of hands on who thinks he should be fired , but we can introduce a vote of no confidence at the next board meeting .
__label__joy	I want to invite you to enjoy the food I cook .
__label__noemo	You can always transfer money from that account into your new one .
__label__noemo	Yes , we have an excellent retirement plan and medical insurance as well .
__label__noemo	It may have been random , but have you ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I don't know.It depends .
__label__noemo	It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things .
__label__noemo	I wish to buy a diamond ring .
__label__noemo	Ah , Oh ! Are you hurt ?
__label__noemo	Is it this one ?
__label__noemo	People go to the cemetery to pay their respects to the dead .
__label__noemo	I didn't realize you felt so strongly about it .
__label__noemo	Everyone has his own habits , but these habits are not very good . The noise often spoils other people ’ s appetite .
__label__noemo	Our room number is eleven-seven and my name is Terry Chen .
__label__noemo	I can read the subtitles.My set is a huge-screen one .
__label__joy	Sure . Take your time .
__label__noemo	I want that .
__label__noemo	I don't know.It ' s still up in tha air .
__label__joy	Enjoy your food ! Bye !
__label__noemo	Yes , I think we might be free . What did you have in mind ?
__label__noemo	I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter .
__label__noemo	Sure . 878 Fennel South .
__label__noemo	Oh , I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet .
__label__noemo	You've got it ! But are we coming back for the music , or for the fruit ?
__label__noemo	I fell on the way to school , and your bike got scratched . I'm really sorry .
__label__noemo	Every so often . It is very convenient and the price is lower than in stores .
__label__noemo	Where is the parking structure at ?
__label__noemo	Which school is your children in ?
__label__joy	I know , fresh fruit flavored is the best ever .
__label__noemo	Yes , I can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . But nowadays you just don't see the birds that you used to see around here .
__label__noemo	Well , can you be more specific ? There are a lot of websites about that .
__label__noemo	One study said that low-income groups have a higher percentage of over-weight people than higher income families .
__label__anger	Your inspector needs spectacles . The fact is that cockroaches are running rampant .
__label__noemo	The check was written for $ 150 .
__label__joy	I ’ m going there for a tour , too . Is this your first trip to China ?
__label__noemo	that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stir-fried on its own until its cooked through .
__label__noemo	Ok , then we can sign up for it together .
__label__noemo	Now , why do you want to exchange it ?
__label__noemo	Mmmm ... that does sound interesting . Is there anyone available I can talk with about this in more detail ?
__label__noemo	I want to buy some flowers for my wife's birthday .
__label__joy	Sure , whatever you need .
__label__noemo	Those people are quarrelling .
__label__joy	Thank you very much , David . It's an excellent birthday gift .
__label__joy	That ’ s right.They taste so good.We eat them with mint sauce.Have you ever tried them ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m going to need you to show me how to use the machine .
__label__noemo	On the 14th Street side . Oh , we are already at the 16th Street . You are fast . Can you make a left at the next corner ?
__label__noemo	Well , I've found out a lot about this type of work and my research suggests that I would be quite capable of doing the work involved . I also think that I would be able to handle any training course reasonably well .
__label__noemo	Do you think that I could have a different paint color in my apartment ?
__label__noemo	I got it . Thank you so much .
__label__noemo	Hopefully , we ’ ll both have relaxing weekends .
__label__joy	Yeah , well , that was some good advice . You made some really good points .
__label__noemo	Let me take a look . This is for a 486 computer with modem . Who ’ s it going to ?
__label__noemo	Well , for many international students , coming to the United States and living here and studying can be quite a daunting experience , especially when finding a house on campus or off campus .
__label__noemo	Do you know if there's a restroom around here ?
__label__noemo	We also will have to check your department budget . Do you know how much money you have for office supplies ?
__label__joy	I requested it . What do you say ? Do you have your dancing shoes on ?
__label__noemo	Anything else you'll be needing today , Sir ?
__label__noemo	My first job's salary will be a bit low . So the cheaper the better . Just one I can afford .
__label__noemo	Well , how about 4th ?
__label__noemo	I need to get some business cards printed up .
__label__noemo	I saw him last week . It seems he was a bit queer in the head .
__label__noemo	Um . . . let me double check . . . unfortunately , she ’ s booked solid on Thursday , how does next Monday work for you ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s only seven o ’ clock . Your watch is fast .
__label__noemo	May I see your ticket and passport , PLS ?
__label__noemo	Very much . The room is cozy and the service is jolly good . By the way , could you deliver my luggage to the airport in advance ?
__label__noemo	All right , Mr . Cook . I'll have Mr . Baker call you back as soon as he gets here .
__label__joy	Kata ! You've got a beautiful singing voice . You hit the high notes perfectly .
__label__noemo	And this kitchen is so clean . Did you help Johnny with that ?
__label__noemo	You should also state that you are his class president , so you are qualified to write this recommendation letter
__label__noemo	You can leave your baggage in our storage space , with a deposit .
__label__noemo	906 Ottawa street . My name is David Yang . My phone number is 713-786-0234 .
__label__noemo	Do you reimburse for education that relates to my job ?
__label__noemo	27th day of the fourth month .
__label__noemo	Have you received any other honors ?
__label__joy	Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it .
__label__noemo	But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ?
__label__noemo	I am thinking about resigning from my current job .
__label__noemo	Our country is a free trade nation . She was mainly agriculture and rather a backward country and mow has developed into a modern highly industrialized state with an expanding economy . Parallel to this , her dependence upon foreign trade has increased . Increased output generates a greater need for raw materials , semi-finished products and capital goods . Thus . in many fields , our country is an important and growing market for exporters from other countries . But this doesn't mean that our country is an easy market , because of a liberal import policy and the high standard in our market is keen .
__label__joy	Sounds pretty good . How much do you charge ?
__label__noemo	Why do you want to leave the company ?
__label__noemo	There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers , but they aren't . They break into computers and break the phone system . Real hackers call these people crackers , and want nothing to do with them .
__label__noemo	I am good at tennis and skiing . What about you ?
__label__surprise	What ? Are you sure about that ?
__label__noemo	All right . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drugstore .
__label__noemo	When did it begin to be called Harvard University ?
__label__noemo	Enough ! If we don't finish the game , there won't be time for any movies tonight !
__label__noemo	It's free , but the monthly sticker is $ 24 .
__label__noemo	Good morning . I want to apply for a library card .
__label__noemo	A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered .
__label__noemo	This room has two double beds.It ' s number 56 at the rear of the motel.It ' s quite a comfortable room .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid there's nothing available before noon .
__label__noemo	And this ?
__label__joy	But you did it and did it well !
__label__noemo	I am a student engineer who mainly took charge of understanding of the mechanical strength and corrosion resistance of various materials .
__label__noemo	no , by that time , I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces !
__label__anger	Stupid girl , making me spend so much money , now I have to get it from the ATM ...
__label__noemo	Yes , I have .
__label__noemo	What is this ? I didn't order that .
__label__noemo	Six hundred euro .
__label__noemo	And have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
__label__noemo	Wow , this is drop-dead gorgeous .
__label__joy	He's after your own heart , it is important .
__label__noemo	What ’ s happening ?
__label__noemo	You know that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ?
__label__noemo	Welcome to Hong Kong . I'll go and get the car . Could you please wait a few minutes ?
__label__noemo	I will have my assistant check my calendar and get back to you with the exact time . Can you bring me an outline of the project when you come ?
__label__noemo	There ’ s an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions . I enjoyed reading her thought . The which ? section is very interesting this month . They tested facial cleaners . T
__label__noemo	OK . But which size should I use ?
__label__joy	Here you are . Thanks for your wonderful service .
__label__noemo	Maybe her uncle will .
__label__noemo	I'd like to say goodbye to you .
__label__noemo	He said he would celebrate his girlfriend's birthday .
__label__noemo	Just coke will be fine .
__label__anger	Absolutely unbelievable ! You people should be ashamed of yourselves .
__label__noemo	I'm going to clean it .
__label__noemo	OK . All the registered airmail packages can be received in 5 working days .
__label__noemo	She's 42 .
__label__noemo	i have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding .
__label__joy	Would you like to have rice with your chicken ?
__label__noemo	What we will do is to strengthen it .
__label__joy	That's really kind of you .
__label__joy	Much better now . Thanks again .
__label__noemo	To have a combination of technical and business knowledge and to be very results-oriented . My past record shows that I have those qualities and more . Because of my business acumen and technical know-how , the teams I have managed accomplished outstanding results , including booking more than $ 50 million in online revenue .
__label__surprise	Really ? Do I look happy all the time ?
__label__noemo	Good afternoon , sir . May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I did . I send most of them a week ago . I ’ Ve brought some with me to the party to give to people in person .
__label__noemo	Well , good morning , Tom . I haven't seen you for a long time .
__label__noemo	Yes , usually it takes a short time , but you have to await the choice of the units for a while .
__label__noemo	Who knows ! That might come to later .
__label__joy	Ok , I'll have it for a change .
__label__noemo	I am afraid I can't agree with you there . I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies .
__label__noemo	I'd love to , but I have a night class on Thursdays .
__label__noemo	Yes , sir , I'll be there in just a moment .
__label__noemo	that's thoughtful of you .
__label__noemo	So maybe we shouldn't go out after all .
__label__noemo	Well , what's the matter with you ?
__label__noemo	Hey , I ’ m a pretty cool guy ; I ’ ll make friends . And I ’ ll have a lot of extra-curricular activities too . You know , like fencing or theater or something .
__label__noemo	Yes . I ’ ll have a room free next week .
__label__noemo	But I have a prescription . I just need more of it .
__label__noemo	But why ? Why don't people like to buy shirts duty-free ? Or shoes ? I just don't understand why it's always liquor .
__label__noemo	Right ! So how do I do that ? What will make you happy ?
__label__noemo	And not expensive either .
__label__noemo	Mary , I'd like you to meet Richard , Our new executive in the marketing .
__label__noemo	don't you think it ’ s a bit bright ?
__label__noemo	Do you think it's easy for a Chinese to get accustomed to the western culture ?
__label__noemo	Here it is .
__label__noemo	How is the project going ?
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__joy	Sure . She is the ideal girl , the one I had dreamed of .
__label__noemo	Good . Can you please also list all the documents in those old files ?
__label__noemo	Daniel , hold on for a minute . What are you trying to pull there ?
__label__noemo	And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ?
__label__noemo	What are you buying ?
__label__fear	Gosh ! I can see the flames !
__label__noemo	That old thing ! Why don't you just buy a new one ?
__label__joy	All right . See you then .
__label__noemo	Are you interested in the natural landscape or the human landscape ?
__label__noemo	It won't be long . No more than ten minutes . Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park ?
__label__noemo	Hello , Xu Hua . I'm Paula . I'm American .
__label__noemo	You are quite right .
__label__noemo	Yes , speaking.May I help you ?
__label__noemo	I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table .
__label__noemo	Are you a visitor or a resident ?
__label__noemo	How many books am I allowed to check out at a time ?
__label__noemo	ok . What do you think about our living room ?
__label__noemo	Do I have to deposit my handbag at the checkroom ?
__label__noemo	She's another antique .
__label__noemo	What are you shopping for ?
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__noemo	Hello . Excuse me . Do you know if there's a Commercial Bank around here ?
__label__noemo	How about tomorrow morning at 9 ?
__label__noemo	The heroin may not be attractive . I like the story , though .
__label__noemo	Not at all .
__label__joy	That ’ s useful to know . Thanks . I ’ ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .
__label__noemo	Hi Julie . Yeah . I've been on a diet for a couple of months now .
__label__anger	Ah ! No ! Damn it !
__label__noemo	It ’ s at the park up the street .
__label__noemo	Oh , listen , you'll soon learn , and I am sure they will explain to you how they like to get prepared .
__label__noemo	Your resume says you have had one years experience working in a foreign representative office in Shanghai , may I ask why you quit ?
__label__noemo	I will help to prepare food , feed animals and clean up . I ’ m very excited about it now .
__label__noemo	What is the scale of the company ?
__label__noemo	Well , I guess no one can help me but myself . For the moment , I just need someone to talk to so that I can relieve my stress .
__label__noemo	Yeah , you ’ re a pretty big guy . I play goalie , myself .
__label__noemo	Let's see ... That was about six years ago .
__label__noemo	Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile .
__label__noemo	I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning and not feel a thing .
__label__joy	Oh , here's a little token of my affection .
__label__noemo	It ’ s just nerves . Just play the right hand for now . One two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . Good , good . Don ’ t forget the accidentals ! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp but now it ’ s a G-natural . Now add the bass clef . You ’ re going too fast . Remember the tempo for this piece is andante .
__label__noemo	Good question . I have to think about it .
__label__noemo	May I see the manager of your office ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I am . But I'm not sure if I'm eligible .
__label__joy	I'll pick you up by nine o'clock and take you straight to the airport .
__label__noemo	That's right .
__label__noemo	I found some coins that are not from here .
__label__joy	Pretty good , Sam . Only the awful weather , you know .
__label__noemo	Yes , and I don't want to be interrupted .
__label__surprise	Really ? What happened ?
__label__noemo	Is he doing very well at school ?
__label__noemo	It's okay ... I've already had several days in a row working through lunch ...
__label__noemo	Well , let me see ... Do you work at IBM Corporation ?
__label__noemo	Wow ! Good timing .
__label__noemo	I agree with that , it just doesn't work for me .
__label__noemo	According to your advertisement , you want an experienced software engineer . I think my background meets the requirement of this position .
__label__noemo	Fill it up with premium , please .
__label__noemo	87 cents .
__label__noemo	Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him .
__label__joy	Yes , actually . I don't really know anyone , but it's a nice place . Are you having a good time ?
__label__noemo	Then say it .
__label__joy	I see . Talking with other people is very important .
__label__noemo	Mr . Phillips ? I have a request here from purchasing that needs your approval .
__label__surprise	What !
__label__noemo	Hi Mark .
__label__noemo	And you can hear singing and laughing everywhere ! People are happy in autumn because autumn brings them harvest and richness and prosperity !
__label__noemo	It's my honor , Mr . Mike . By the way , how can I know whether I am accepted or not ?
__label__noemo	What about taking the cable car ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I am . I have life insurance and my home and its contents are also insured .
__label__noemo	OK , let's see what the damage is . The total for our meal is $ 36.00 .
__label__noemo	Seventy-six , I think .
__label__noemo	When I have a specific project to complete , I like to know the specifics of a project from beginning to end . I like definite deadlines and I like to meet those deadlines . I expect some deviation from the original plan , but I try to stay focused and not let myself drift too far . I have great attention to detail and like to take my time and do it right the first time .
__label__noemo	I'm supposed to do it , but the general manager called me last night . He said he couldn ’ t come back to Beijing as scheduled , so he asked me to attend the meeting for him .
__label__noemo	At least five channels have morning cartoons on Saturdays .
__label__noemo	It's almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild .
__label__joy	See you .
__label__noemo	And special TV programs , fire crackers and the games to play .
__label__joy	This book is so good . I just can't put it down ! It's called ' The Power of One ' .
__label__joy	That's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
__label__noemo	I am sorry . I can ’ t hear your very clearly . Could you say that again , please ?
__label__noemo	Yes , you can find it at the entrance .
__label__noemo	Yes , please .
__label__noemo	You won't be late . It's still early .
__label__noemo	OK , we could look at that .
__label__noemo	Do you know where they're vacationing ?
__label__noemo	Good morning , Paul !
__label__noemo	Sounds painful !
__label__noemo	I did , too .
__label__noemo	I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ?
__label__noemo	Do you like to dance ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me , sir . I would like to buy a bag of tissue paper and shoe cream .
__label__noemo	I'm feeling hungry .
__label__noemo	You must weigh that as well .
__label__joy	It ’ s very kind of you to invite me to dinner .
__label__noemo	Could you tell me if you have ever taken a class from Dr . Miller ?
__label__noemo	For how many people
__label__joy	I am so excited to be voting .
__label__noemo	Let ’ s do it !
__label__noemo	These are Chucks .
__label__noemo	Couple times a week . How about you ?
__label__noemo	Here is a free class going on right over there . Go and join them .
__label__noemo	All right . Where do you live , sir ?
__label__noemo	Well , I understand how you feel , and we will try to do our best to help you . But first please allow me to send one of the housemaids to your room to look for it again thoroughly , just in case it's still in there . If she finds it , we will all be happy . If she doesn't , we will turn the whole matter to the police . But I must say that the hotel can't be held responsible for your loss . You should have locked your gold necklace away at the hotel ’ s safety box . If you had read your key card carefully , you would have realized that we specially warned you to do so .
__label__noemo	English weather is even more predictable than I had previously thought .
__label__anger	What does that mean ?
__label__noemo	The apples in my room were delicious . Bring me a few more , please .
__label__noemo	Let me see . There ’ s the news section , the entertainment section , sports , business , and world affairs .
__label__noemo	Tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	How about this floor lamp ?
__label__noemo	Well , yes , I am . I'm worried about my work . I've just taken a new job . I earn a lot of money but it's difficult work . I'm always afraid of making a mistake .
__label__noemo	Well , here you are .
__label__noemo	Yes . It was sunny and warm yesterday but the wind is really blowing hard now .
__label__noemo	That's a problem .
__label__noemo	Yeah . We rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
__label__noemo	That's $ 400 and we will visit 4 cities .
__label__noemo	At Tinge Depot .
__label__noemo	Hi , Walter !
__label__noemo	That's very kind of you .
__label__noemo	She's not bad . She's a bit bossy , but I'm sure I'll get used to her .
__label__noemo	Yes , because I think being interesting thing is the best teacher . Or have more opportunities to have career growth .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I'll call later to patch things up .
__label__noemo	I did a B . A . in economics.Remember ?
__label__noemo	so , which sport do you prefer---basketball or baseball ?
__label__noemo	Aren't you tired ?
__label__noemo	Yes , but the problem is that I have a Savings Account with you , and I need to take some money from that . Do I really have to give 90 days notice if I want my money ?
__label__noemo	OK , let's get the ball rolling on this .
__label__noemo	Where were you at ?
__label__noemo	I'll plan for the vacation .
__label__noemo	Well , we've been waiting for our luggage for about one hour .
__label__noemo	Well , that all depends on how much you want to invest .
__label__noemo	Oh , it's a Polo . It has the logo on the back and at the bottom in the left-hand corner .
__label__noemo	It's the mailman , Mother . Here's a letter from Uncle George .
__label__noemo	Actually , uh , I made it myself ...
__label__noemo	I don't think this is fresh .
__label__joy	OK.It ' s delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh .
__label__noemo	Of house , what's the matter ?
__label__noemo	It doesn't matter , but leave me some small changes , that will be convenient in daily life .
__label__noemo	When you buy a Model T , you can't expect a warranty .
__label__noemo	Please take us to Harvard University . By the way , is it far from here ?
__label__noemo	That's pretty tough !
__label__noemo	Just last week .
__label__joy	Of course not . Let me check . Oh , you seem to be correct .
__label__joy	Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ’ Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ’ s too much information on the net .
__label__noemo	I ’ m afraid not .
__label__noemo	That's the case . I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__sadness	Oh . I enjoy watching boxing on television , too.What a pity I missed it last night !
__label__noemo	Here is the menu .
__label__noemo	I will show you .
__label__noemo	Where is the library ?
__label__noemo	That'll be 12 dollars and 95 cents , please .
__label__noemo	Yes . At the end , we should conclude the letter with greetings .
__label__surprise	Really ? How can I do that ?
__label__noemo	Now , Mr . Smith , could you fill out this registration form , please ?
__label__noemo	She'd better keep away from them .
__label__sadness	I am sorry , we will change yours for a new one .
__label__noemo	That's nice . Where is his villa ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me.Could you tell me how to return to the Hilton Hotel ? I am afraid I lost my way .
__label__noemo	Well , he's thin and tall . He has brown hair , a holt nose , green eyes and wearing glasses .
__label__noemo	Can the Assistant Manager meet you instead ?
__label__noemo	I just checked in , and there's a problem with my room .
__label__noemo	Not at all . I don't know what's dutiable.Do I have to pay duty on things for my own use ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I see it . Do you have multi-vitamins ?
__label__noemo	Would you please make it for a single person ?
__label__joy	snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets .
__label__noemo	Honey , if you don't want to go to cram school , you should tell me the reason why .
__label__noemo	How about the shelf ?
__label__joy	We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okapi ! There ’ s the pitch , he hits it ! It ’ s going , going , that ball is gone !
__label__noemo	Well . . . perhaps you should think about it .
__label__noemo	No problem . So how have you been ?
__label__noemo	Oh , Hi Tom , how have you been ?
__label__surprise	oh , really ? so you just took home a stray cat ?
__label__noemo	This is sure to be a worthwhile read .
__label__noemo	What leadership qualities did you develop as an administrative personnel ?
__label__noemo	Throughout the interview you should maintain patience .
__label__noemo	John , if you don't mind , I'd like to ask you a personal question .
__label__noemo	I left it at my parent's house , but I need one here as well .
__label__noemo	I'm a doctor .
__label__noemo	I'm on a weekly schedule . You're messing everything up .
__label__noemo	You are always be the most beautiful one in the world . What is the bridemaid's name ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I ’ d better give her a call now .
__label__noemo	Yes , I knew I would make it .
__label__noemo	Well , mine are baggy . They're the kind of pants you can lounge around in .
__label__noemo	With Susan leaving , we should probably look to someone new on board .
__label__noemo	I see . Can I sit down ?
__label__noemo	I guess so . What else can we do ? You can ’ t stay in the heat for long .
__label__joy	Do you like flowers ?
__label__noemo	Please wait a moment .
__label__anger	This is room 2012 . Where is my laundry ? You promised to send to me this morning .
__label__joy	Yes , that's OK . I'm glad to get started .
__label__noemo	You are speaking with Ryan . How can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Oh , here comes a bus !
__label__noemo	Oh , how was it ?
__label__noemo	Actually , a friend of a friend .
__label__surprise	University ? Why ? You asked me last year .
__label__joy	Let's keep in touch .
__label__joy	That sounds like a great breakfast .
__label__noemo	I bet you find the character difficult to write !
__label__noemo	It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax .
__label__noemo	He said I ' d got the flu .
__label__noemo	What ’ s the time ?
__label__noemo	Sawdust ?
__label__noemo	Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point .
__label__noemo	Peter , have you seen my purse ?
__label__noemo	No way . Look . That's what the meter says .
__label__noemo	Did you eat any cake ?
__label__noemo	I prefer going by train , ever though it costs more .
__label__noemo	Why ? What's the problem ?
__label__noemo	What do you recommend ? What can I do to lose weight ?
__label__noemo	Good afternoon , madam . Is there anything I can do for you ?
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve been to other Scandinavian countries , but not to Norway . Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there .
__label__noemo	Sorry , we don't give discounts .
__label__noemo	The sale price today is $ 1 each .
__label__joy	Here is a gift for you . I hope you like it .
__label__joy	Thank you very much . See you then .
__label__noemo	Anything else I should bring ?
__label__noemo	No . It'll only take about five minutes to walk .
__label__noemo	The Giants ?
__label__noemo	At a time like this , what she needs is a pat on the back rather than a blame .
__label__noemo	That's true . In summer , the first place people want to go is a spacious room with air-conditioning or a quiet river or swimming pool .
__label__noemo	I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . I'd like to postpone that discussion until later .
__label__noemo	When did you get that ?
__label__noemo	Hi , Maggy , Did you hear about David ?
__label__noemo	It's OK . Please have a taste of it .
__label__noemo	Yes , it probably is . I don ’ t like ordering oysters in restaurants . You never know whether they are fresh .
__label__noemo	OK.Can I see the room now ?
__label__noemo	OK , please fill in the form first .
__label__joy	Well , we have nicer things than that in this company . You will find out soon .
__label__noemo	Where am I supposed to change ?
__label__noemo	I'm calling about the apartment for rent on Main Street .
__label__noemo	Certainly.What time will you come back ?
__label__noemo	Because the traffic is not crowded .
__label__noemo	Oh ! I feel really under the weather . I ’ Ve got a sore throat and a bad cough .
__label__noemo	I just got back from fighting the crowds .
__label__noemo	Oh , poor you . You know what ? I found a new way to learn Chinese and it works very well .
__label__surprise	Really ? I really want to have a try !
__label__noemo	Hi Mary , how's it going ?
__label__noemo	Can you tell me where the produce is ?
__label__joy	Excellent . I have been expecting it .
__label__sadness	Oh , darn . Look what I've done . ( Spill the drink )
__label__surprise	Oh . Why did she do that ?
__label__noemo	Watch your step . There's a hole in the sidewalk .
__label__noemo	Ok . This man is tall and slim . He ’ s got blue eyes and curly brown hair .
__label__noemo	Where'd you get the ticket at ?
__label__noemo	Croissant for appetizer and two beef steaks for dinner .
__label__noemo	Yes , it does .
__label__noemo	About two years now .
__label__noemo	it ’ s about six or seven miles . That ’ s about the kilometers .
__label__noemo	Hi . I need a wake-up call tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Well , why don ’ t you come tomorrow ? I ’ ll stop by your house on my way out .
__label__noemo	Wouldn ’ t the owners have told me about any problems ?
__label__noemo	No , it's not .
__label__joy	Really , it was nothing .
__label__noemo	That's everything .
__label__noemo	Good morning , this is Mary .
__label__noemo	Well , we've just finished laying the cabling and we're waiting for the safety inspector to give us the go-ahead to continue . I'm just going to meet him . Do you want to come ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry , I'm afraid you've dialed the wrong number . There is no Petti here .
__label__noemo	Yes , only one travel bag .
__label__noemo	No , Ah ... single sellers .
__label__noemo	Well , do you think I have to ?
__label__noemo	Listen , Karen , I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet .
__label__noemo	I hope you can show me your CPA certificate before we reach a decision by the end of July .
__label__noemo	Thanks , Mr . McQuillin . I'll give you a call a week in advance to confirm the arrangements .
__label__noemo	Have you a full-day trip ?
__label__noemo	I heard that you country recently discovered deposits of precious stone .
__label__noemo	Yes . I just need to double check a few details with you .
__label__noemo	Hello .
__label__noemo	No , not yet .
__label__noemo	Dad , what's the date ?
__label__joy	That ’ s fine .
__label__joy	Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ’ t forget the syrup !
__label__noemo	This is the menu . Are you ready to order now ?
__label__noemo	Is this absolutely necessary ?
__label__joy	You know what ? You won't get a rush from it until you fully understand it . It is a simple sport and doesn't require skills of any sort . This leaves room for me to enjoy the beautiful suburban scenery while jogging . Fresh air caresses my face and blows into my chest , which translates into inspirations . Inspirations are really good stuff for a writer like me . Sometimes , I even come up with a verse or two .
__label__noemo	The price can be talked over . How about coming around and taking a look at it first ?
__label__noemo	Oh , sorry about that.We ' ll get it fixed as soon as we can .
__label__noemo	I think it is easier to buy a car than to maintain it . What ’ s worse , I just don ’ t trust those vehicle maintenance shops . Sometimes , they overcharge or don ’ t build those parts I have been paying for . Last week , they even tried to persuade me to buy new parts which really need not to be changed . You know , my car is just half a year old and also good brand . I was just wondering about all these .
__label__noemo	Retail is going upscale here ? China is certainly growing more quickly than I had imagined .
__label__joy	Oh , yes . This is very nice . I'll take this one .
__label__joy	You can ask me any question at any time .
__label__noemo	¥ 350 .
__label__noemo	Ange , can your dog do any tricks yet ?
__label__noemo	What happened ? Why didn't he win ?
__label__noemo	What examinations do they take first ?
__label__noemo	The point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too .
__label__noemo	Whoa , whoa , take it easy , relax . Geez , you ’ re sweating like a pig ! What ’ s going on ?
__label__noemo	what's there to see ?
__label__noemo	I'm going to stay at home .
__label__noemo	Well , then join us some other time .
__label__surprise	What a large child !
__label__noemo	It means That the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . The insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit .
__label__noemo	There're all spicy or hot of heard .
__label__noemo	That ’ s all right . Everyone feels under the weather sometimes . Just finish the rest when you feel well .
__label__joy	Don ’ t tell me ! I ’ m sure it ’ s someplace warm and sunny with great beaches !
__label__noemo	Anything you say , Madam .
__label__noemo	No , I haven ’ t been out on one interview yet .
__label__noemo	I hope so . Did you know the US successfully sent two robotic explorers to Mars last month ?
__label__noemo	I hate dentists .
__label__noemo	That ’ s fine with me . I don ’ t hate vegetables and I don ’ t eat much during lunch .
__label__noemo	Alright , alright . I ’ m coming .
__label__noemo	What makes you think so ?
__label__noemo	It's $ 25 .
__label__noemo	Yes , please . I'd like the steak and mushrooms .
__label__noemo	So , if I was strapped for cash , I could transfer it to get some money ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry .
__label__joy	Well , thanks anyway .
__label__noemo	So , this 500 RIB is worthless ?
__label__noemo	I'm going on a guided tour in the mountain .
__label__noemo	Well , it's just that I think if you don't enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it .
__label__joy	I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it . What did you think of it ?
__label__noemo	Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .
__label__noemo	I really appreciate that I would expect my secretary to be able to work independently and take over some of my ordinary responsibilities , such as answering routine correspondence , taking phone calls for me and sometimes assisting me with personal affairs .
__label__noemo	That is just a natural , grammatical English expression . It has a direct translation in other languages .
__label__noemo	I know this may seem like a silly question , but does your car have gasoline ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	I don't have to pay for anything ?
__label__noemo	Ok , I ’ m going to stay up awhile . I ’ Ve got to go over the household budget , We ‘ re a little over-spend this month .
__label__noemo	How about a movie tonight ?
__label__joy	How unlucky for Rikknen , and this race is over ladies and gentlemen , Alonso takes the checkered flag !
__label__noemo	Long Distance . May I help you ?
__label__anger	Whoa whoa whoa ! Are you nuts ? How much is all this going to cost ? I ’ m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ’ s outrageous ! This is basically a crayon !
__label__noemo	I got the message . I'm quiting .
__label__noemo	The only thing is that they have to be washed on the gentle cycle .
__label__noemo	OK . I just saw a Versace for thirty dollars . This stuff can't be real !
__label__noemo	I ’ m not crazy about it at all .
__label__noemo	Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy .
__label__noemo	Yes , of course . We have Treasury Notes with two , three and five-year terms available .
__label__noemo	We have made some adjustment on the prices , and this is renewed price list .
__label__joy	That's fine.Thank you .
__label__noemo	How long are you staying here ?
__label__joy	What are the pop groups that you like ?
__label__joy	That was heaven !
__label__joy	Its very helpful . The course has let me into a world of literature . I read so many great literatures .
__label__noemo	Well . As our sole agency , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own .
__label__noemo	Mrs . Smith has not checked in yet .
__label__noemo	I ’ m afraid this seat is taken .
__label__noemo	I'll take this one .
__label__noemo	It's two blocks down the road .
__label__noemo	Please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry . I forgot to show you the lid . It comes with the pan .
__label__noemo	Oh , is that so ? Well , then . Let me show you something she might like . It's on our back lot .
__label__noemo	Bob , did you see our supervisor ? I need him to sign this paper .
__label__noemo	Okay – that ’ s 232-2453 , or 232-2456 .
__label__noemo	I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails .
__label__noemo	Mrcrabby , I ’ m pleased to see you .
__label__noemo	I'll have whatever you're having .
__label__noemo	Of course there is . The top-level coaches there are from the State Sports General Administration .
__label__noemo	Do you know his sister ?
__label__noemo	If he promised to help you , I'm sure he will help . He's a man of his word .
__label__noemo	You can always make a sandwich .
__label__noemo	That's fine , Sir . We'll see you again a little later .
__label__noemo	Yes ?
__label__noemo	I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really . arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff .
__label__sadness	I just broke up with a girl . Why didn't she understand that I loved her ?
__label__noemo	Fifth Avenue .
__label__noemo	When is your flight ?
__label__noemo	Ok . I should have it finished by Friday afternoon . Then I can check those account over the weekend . We need to have them finished by Monday , right ?
__label__noemo	so what ?
__label__noemo	Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .
__label__noemo	And which side of the business do you work in ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , yeah , yeah ! They wipe out tight , tired feelings and remove lines and age signs . Blah , blah ... See , I can even recite it .
__label__joy	It's my pleasure . See you .
__label__noemo	Did you remember to bring back that software I lent to you ?
__label__noemo	That will be no problem , sir .
__label__noemo	Is it possible for me to buy some RIB at this counter ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I'm afraid so .
__label__noemo	Yes . An automatic message says your phone is not in service .
__label__noemo	She must also be diligent and do a lot of things on her own initiative .
__label__noemo	Is that near here ?
__label__noemo	I come home for lunch .
__label__joy	It's a deal .
__label__noemo	what do you think of studying abroad ?
__label__noemo	Only then did I realize it was April Fools ' Day .
__label__noemo	Thank you , Mr . Smith . Goodbye .
__label__noemo	are you planning on going to university ?
__label__joy	I know . And you can also hear outside noises while you listen to music .
__label__noemo	Anything else ?
__label__noemo	You bet !
__label__noemo	What is the biggest fun for you on Thanksgiving ?
__label__noemo	I like almost all kinds of music . But I like country music best .
__label__noemo	Straight , I think , and about average length
__label__noemo	Let ' s see . These books here focus on grammar , and those are mainly for conversation practice ... Here we are . This book has short passages for students to read and answer questions about .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I guess you're right . It's easy to get bogged down in the day to day , and forget to change things up once in a while . Let's break out and do something completely different tonight .
__label__noemo	that's too bad.They ' re such good company .
__label__sadness	I feel like maybe I am coming down with the flu .
__label__noemo	Let me see . What a moving poem !
__label__noemo	Who is your favorite NBA star ?
__label__noemo	I suppose I should choose one from the ' Best Career List ' , to be a public officer , what do you think ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I want to buy some grapes .
__label__joy	Jenny is getting married .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry we don't ship overseas . It's too much trouble .
__label__joy	Good . How about you ?
__label__noemo	I would feel better if you came over and took care of me .
__label__joy	Of course , I will .
__label__noemo	The individual landlord's numbers are next to each entry . You can call them with any questions you may have .
__label__noemo	Guess !
__label__noemo	I know and they are really nice , too .
__label__noemo	Yes . I believe you have a luncheon meeting this coming Wednesday.Could you give me some more information about that ?
__label__noemo	We have steamed chicken , braised pork and Beijing roast duck and so on . Here's the menu . What would you like to have ?
__label__noemo	I am probably best at researching for marketing purposes .
__label__noemo	Did you find everything ok today ?
__label__noemo	But you two used to do everything together . I thought you really enjoyed each other's company .
__label__joy	You've made a good decision . How would you like to pay ?
__label__noemo	May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ?
__label__noemo	01705 ...
__label__noemo	Wold you like to see menu first or wait for your friends ?
__label__noemo	You'll find the parking structure on the west side of the campus .
__label__noemo	Unfortunately , it isn't . VISA or MasterCard will suffice , though .
__label__sadness	I ’ m down in spirits .
__label__noemo	First of all , it ’ s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century .
__label__noemo	He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .
__label__noemo	Oh , do you use your computer often ?
__label__joy	That's great .
__label__noemo	I can't consider you as a little kid any more . I know he is very tall .
__label__noemo	Sam , we are hard up for the everyday expenses . When can you find a job .
__label__noemo	Hasn't it ! It's been cold and windy recently.Do you like the weather here ?
__label__noemo	Premium , please . Thanks . Please fill it up .
__label__joy	Thank you . Actually , I could not believe it at first . You know , there're so many outstanding people in our company . Many of them are qualified to fill that position .
__label__noemo	What does a mango taste like ?
__label__noemo	Ok . Have a good stay . Here's your passport and documents back .
__label__noemo	Please forgive me just being frankly , madam . You don't need whitening products because you look pretty white . But you have freckles on your face .
__label__joy	Sure , that sounds good .
__label__noemo	No , the taxi will do .
__label__noemo	My husband is betting on France .
__label__noemo	You know what , this is really embarrassing , but your name has just slipped my mind . Can you remind me ?
__label__noemo	Surely , there are other ways to save money .
__label__noemo	Very good , you can come here to work next month .
__label__noemo	Would you mind doing something for me ?
__label__joy	Well , you heard right.You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here.We have great discounts for students .
__label__sadness	I don ’ t have one time in particular . I just go to sleep whenever I feel tired .
__label__noemo	Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened .
__label__noemo	I don't know if it will turn out good.The window might cause the picture to be blurry .
__label__noemo	I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name .
__label__noemo	I want to have a foot massage and a haircut .
__label__noemo	Would you tell her Tom Gray called ?
__label__noemo	I don't know .
__label__noemo	Bill Smith .
__label__noemo	Right .
__label__noemo	What ’ s the matter , BOB ?
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but Mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class .
__label__noemo	You will be able to add or get rid of channels another day .
__label__noemo	Are you interested in purchasing on the lake , or would you like a home with a view ?
__label__noemo	Where is the pain ? Could you show me please ?
__label__noemo	Tell me what you want to eat .
__label__noemo	You see , there is a run at the neck .
__label__noemo	Mr . Reynolds ? Rick Murphy . I ’ m the accounting manager for Macmillan and Emory , Incorporated .
__label__noemo	What ’ s your usual percentage of rejects ?
__label__joy	There it is . That is the pattern ! The set behind you . Thank goodness , they haven't been sold . And thank you so much for being so patient with me . Yes , those are the ones .
__label__noemo	Any way , in a word , panda is our friend .
__label__noemo	I need to make a transfer .
__label__noemo	When did the pipe start leaking ?
__label__noemo	There are a few spots on it . I am afraid you will not have it tomorrow . Dry-cleaning usually takes three days .
__label__noemo	When everything is over .
__label__noemo	But it's the style now .
__label__noemo	What would you like to have for dinner ? Chicken or beef ?
__label__anger	the thing is , this isn't the first time he's promised to do something and then didn't .
__label__noemo	Leaving on September 5th and returning to New York City on October 9th .
__label__noemo	You should draw a picture of a fancy kingdom of animals in forty minutes .
__label__joy	Oh , boy ! This is going to be great . I'm going to the gym right now !
__label__noemo	It doesn ’ t matter to me .
__label__noemo	Sure . All of our mixed drinks are excellent . You can also try a delicious non-alcoholic cocktail .
__label__noemo	Absolutely right . I myself sometimes believe that healthy eating is just about feeling great . As long as I have enough energy , it's fine .
__label__noemo	Could it be the battery ?
__label__joy	What are you going to do next year ?
__label__noemo	Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff .
__label__noemo	I have this list of stuff that I need and I only have half the dough .
__label__joy	And he can move . too ! He dances like Ricky Martin !
__label__noemo	Hello , Bob , this is Frank .
__label__noemo	This is the lease . You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords .
__label__noemo	You put it in the slot at the turnstile and then push the turnstile to get into the platform .
__label__noemo	There will be no charge on baggage left by guests who have checked out .
__label__noemo	You are so pessimistic ! The Olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed , skill , agility and strength . Most people hope to see someone from their country win , but I think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete .
__label__noemo	I just want the problem taken care of .
__label__noemo	Not me . I have to have my TV and watch whatever comes on .
__label__joy	Well , I have no regrets !
__label__noemo	Do you have cheongsams ?
__label__noemo	How Ay days will the reunion be ?
__label__noemo	I think I'll Ty the crisp deep-fried chicken .
__label__noemo	( Person A comes out of the dressing room ) How did you like the sweater ?
__label__noemo	I also need three pounds of chicken breasts .
__label__noemo	Your car is rather old.Why not change a new one ?
__label__noemo	I am sorry , I was too tired to fall asleep .
__label__noemo	How long do you plan to stay ?
__label__noemo	In my opinion , it may be necessary to charge for participation .
__label__noemo	so have you cured your fear of heights ?
__label__noemo	Round about seven .
__label__noemo	This is a nice place , but you need to get some furniture .
__label__anger	Ur , you really let me down .
__label__noemo	I can't open this email attachment our Paris office has sent me .
__label__joy	Nice to meet you guys .
__label__noemo	Are we covered by a good benefits plan ?
__label__noemo	No , I mean some of them are not clean enough .
__label__noemo	Yes , I took off 4 kilos . I am glad you notice it .
__label__noemo	I think that the apartment looks very nice , but I do see some problems .
__label__joy	That is exactly what I needed ! What else do you have ?
__label__noemo	Let's stop it at Multicolor for a quick lunch ..
__label__noemo	If you don't mind , you can use my camera and leave your address with me so I can send you the photos later .
__label__noemo	Let's go out for some exercise , shall we ?
__label__sadness	I ’ m a bit upset about this year ’ s bonus . I was really expecting a little more . Are there any problems with my work ?
__label__noemo	good morning , Gav ! Did you sleep well last night ?
__label__noemo	Ok . When is your train supposed to leave ?
__label__noemo	That's great , bring me a bottle of that please .
__label__noemo	did you end up losing any of your work ?
__label__noemo	She works as a teller in a bank .
__label__noemo	Certainly , sir . Just tell me your account number please .
__label__noemo	The New Bar is all techno music on Friday night.You really want to dance to that ?
__label__joy	Thank you . I'll be sure to take a look .
__label__noemo	I met him through a computer bulletin board .
__label__noemo	Sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs .
__label__noemo	Believe me , it's worth the price .
__label__sadness	I really wish I hadn ’ t done it .
__label__noemo	Xu spikes it ! Wow , what a great hit ! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in !
__label__noemo	I hear what you're saying , and I wish there were something I could do .
__label__joy	It's really nice of you . Thanks !
__label__joy	Attractive scenery , pleasant climate , these make it charming .
__label__noemo	Of course . I will find you one .
__label__noemo	Hello , Mary . Why are you standing here in the cold wind ?
__label__sadness	What a pity !
__label__noemo	Daisy ’ s in hospital too . She god food poisoning last week . She thinks she got it from some bad seafood .
__label__noemo	Really ? So do you have some specialties ?
__label__noemo	I'll pay for it with a check .
__label__noemo	It's an open book that it was stolen by the man in black .
__label__noemo	Oh , they are playing the wedding March . Here they come .
__label__noemo	Japanese is easy to learn .
__label__noemo	What percentage of the stockholders actually attend the meetings ? I'm guessing not a large percentage ...
__label__noemo	I see .
__label__joy	Me , too . What did you have in mind ?
__label__noemo	Who finances the magazine ?
__label__noemo	Yes , that's right .
__label__noemo	I actually work here .
__label__noemo	If a Mr . Wu comes to look for me , just take him here .
__label__noemo	So we must get you to the hotel as soon as possible . I hope to see you refreshed and revitalized tomorrow morning , as we are going to visit the Great Wall .
__label__noemo	The problem is the split ends . They make your hair look even more frizzy .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll do my best .
__label__noemo	Yes , that would be lovely .
__label__noemo	What street do I go to to catch it ?
__label__sadness	I didn't take my cellphone with me at that time .
__label__noemo	I think they gained courage after the mayor's speech last week on equality and opportunity for all town citizens . Anyway , the sentiments have been brewing for quite some time . I mean , we all know the working conditions at the factory are quite horrendous .
__label__noemo	Of course we can .
__label__noemo	Did you check before you left the shop ?
__label__noemo	What is it ? Do you want me to read your essay ?
__label__noemo	Good morning , Ms Chan . What can I get you today ?
__label__noemo	Good morning , Mr . Smith .
__label__noemo	Could you put me through to Dan Aykroyd ?
__label__noemo	Thank you . We'll order once we try the sample .
__label__noemo	That'll be 60 dollars .
__label__noemo	It must be Kate .
__label__joy	Oh , yeah . OK . I'll just buy smallthings !
__label__noemo	Sure , what I can do for you ?
__label__noemo	Sir , would you like some dessert now ?
__label__noemo	Secondly , you need to create a good image in a limited time .
__label__noemo	Really ? Tell me about some of the plants they showed .
__label__noemo	he hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family .
__label__noemo	She often cooks it in a large pan of boiling water .
__label__noemo	Do you like working in teams ?
__label__noemo	I would love to be famous and have thousands of adoring fans .
__label__noemo	The aroma of roasting coffee beans .
__label__noemo	May I take a look at the shoes over there ?
__label__noemo	What genres ?
__label__noemo	You'll find it by the oatmeal and breakfast bars .
__label__noemo	Maybe I am a Barbie Doll , but I won ’ t do Barbie Doll things .
__label__noemo	That ’ s right ! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest .
__label__anger	Did Bean send these dirty jokes to you , too ? Look !
__label__joy	Actually I have a passion for Chinese literature .
__label__noemo	Sure . Here you are .
__label__joy	That ’ s very nice of you to offer . Here ’ s your tea . Be careful , it ’ s still quite hot .
__label__noemo	Let me have a soda .
__label__noemo	Devi , do you have any preference for where you would like to go for dinner for your birthday ?
__label__noemo	When will I know your decision ?
__label__noemo	I made a doctor's appointment for you .
__label__noemo	Hi ! Dick . Where are you going ? You're in such a hurry .
__label__noemo	It's a beautiful day , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	We were talking about Wednesday evenings at the library , from seven to eight .
__label__noemo	I'll use my VISA , if that's okay .
__label__noemo	Yes , even in the winter .
__label__noemo	Don't be discouraged . Just keep trying and you will find a job eventually .
__label__joy	That sounds like fun . But where can I get clothes that old ?
__label__noemo	Is she really ?
__label__noemo	May I know your flight number , please ?
__label__noemo	Good . Go on , please .
__label__joy	I love you .
__label__noemo	What's your favorite magazine ?
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve got a fever and really a bad headache .
__label__noemo	What size ?
__label__surprise	Hi ! Susan ! I haven't seen you for ages !
__label__noemo	His friends will be very happy to get the little souvenir .
__label__noemo	Man , they take a lot of our paycheck .
__label__noemo	How much is it in all ?
__label__noemo	it is unusually warm . I blame it on global warming .
__label__noemo	I have heard about electronic commerce , and many people say it has good prospects for development .
__label__noemo	Yes , madam . Fill 3 or 5 pieces of Cordyceps into a cleaned and chopped open duck's head and cook with the whole duck . Or stew Cordyceps with chicken .
__label__noemo	Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes .
__label__joy	Are we going to walk or drive ?
__label__noemo	... Okay , I'm finished . Here's your form and my old card .
__label__surprise	Oh , I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years .
__label__sadness	We'll get to go fishing at the river . I hate fish .
__label__noemo	I am getting to know your meaning .
__label__noemo	What a shame that we can't take pictures .
__label__noemo	Right now , we have incentives encouraging employees to come to work as often as possible.But employees with colds and the flu are coming to work and infecting their colleagues .
__label__noemo	OK , sir . When will you be there ?
__label__noemo	How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ?
__label__noemo	I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts !
__label__noemo	My mother bought me a new video game .
__label__noemo	When is the first meeting then ?
__label__noemo	Soda is really bad for you .
__label__joy	My pleasure .
__label__joy	No , not this time . We went there last time .
__label__noemo	Yes . And if you already have a Current Account with us , the Insurance Premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle .
__label__noemo	English is my favorite .
__label__noemo	Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ?
__label__noemo	Can I get a quick reply from the sites ?
__label__noemo	Forget about it !
__label__noemo	Keep your fingers crossed . She'll bring home the bacon .
__label__noemo	Hi , John Phillips ? I ’ m Rose Green . I ’ Ve been asked to handle your training and introduce a little bit of the company to you . It ’ s nice to meet you .
__label__noemo	Ok .
__label__noemo	What's up , Bro ? What's in the bulletin ?
__label__disgust	well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss .
__label__noemo	The park will close soon . We Should better go in right now .
__label__anger	I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are !
__label__noemo	Oh , that's really tough .
__label__joy	See you then . Goodbye .
__label__noemo	Yes , it is a new brand .
__label__noemo	I would like to have my coat washed .
__label__noemo	What is your address ?
__label__noemo	Could I try it on ?
__label__noemo	Well , natural pearls are of higher value , but the cultured pearls have equal lustre and are just as beautiful .
__label__noemo	There will be about 18 people .
__label__noemo	We certainly do . I can give you some details about a loan called Personal Loan for Studying Abroad . We offer this to anyone who will study outside this country .
__label__noemo	I was calling about your son .
__label__noemo	Do you know Chinese better now ?
__label__noemo	No , that ’ s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing .
__label__noemo	Why is that ?
__label__joy	I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available .
__label__noemo	I agree , I had lunch there last week .
__label__noemo	Certainly , hold on .
__label__noemo	Could you give some information on your European tours ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s 850 grams . The coasts depends on how you would like to send it .
__label__noemo	Nice to meet you .
__label__noemo	That reminds me I should buy some new socks to go hiking this weekend .
__label__noemo	Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ?
__label__noemo	Are you studying any languages here ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I was . And I like living here.People know how to party here . In Taipei , some people know how to party.But here , everyone does .
__label__noemo	Does she live nearby ?
__label__noemo	We usually ask for 100 RIB , Sir .
__label__noemo	He is doing OK , but he pretends he is doing much better by telling lies .
__label__noemo	Wangfujing Grand Hotels . How can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Same difference . What's this ?
__label__noemo	What ’ s the next question .
__label__sadness	I think the only reason is that I was too nervous during the interview and I couldn't express myself the way I wanted to .
__label__noemo	Did you look in the attic ?
__label__noemo	Well , drop by if you can .
__label__noemo	Slow down and tell me your address .
__label__noemo	You really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I have too much work to do at the moment .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes . How are you ?
__label__noemo	good morning . What seems to be the problem ?
__label__noemo	I like being able to buy newspapers and magazines at the post office . It means that I don ’ t need to go to two places
__label__noemo	Yes , I would like to make a reservation for May 3rd .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes . I'll take this one . Can I pay by traveler ’ s check ?
__label__noemo	definitely . Would you like skim or whole milk ?
__label__noemo	Did you work as a salesperson before , Mrs.Vale ?
__label__noemo	Yes , but I can't find Callaway Street .
__label__noemo	You know , that ’ s going to be a tremendous change for me . Because I never exercise .
__label__noemo	the more , the merrier !
__label__noemo	How many children do you have ?
__label__noemo	Just a minute please . I ’ ll make a call to the HR office .
__label__noemo	What can I do for you , sir ?
__label__noemo	Thank you for your visit to our company . I'd like to make an introduction for you . Is there anything in particular you'd like to know ?
__label__noemo	You know how things get piled up on my desk when I am busy — I know that sometimes I do misplace things , but I always read all the memos that go around . They go directly to my in-box . Are you sure it was sent to the whole office ?
__label__noemo	I will . You know , as a newcomer , I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere .
__label__noemo	I see why it lags behind other towns .
__label__noemo	Of course , you can . Wait a moment .
__label__noemo	Is there anything I can do for you ?
__label__noemo	From the 25th to the 28tri of September .
__label__noemo	Could you tell me please where can I find a currents exchange ?
__label__noemo	Didn't I ?
__label__noemo	Perhaps I'd better ring the police ...
__label__noemo	What was taken ?
__label__noemo	I hope to visit Japan next year .
__label__noemo	All right . I'm opening the window , though , is that OK ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do .
__label__noemo	Is today OK ?
__label__noemo	What arrangement will you make about payment ?
__label__noemo	One . And , if possible , I'm looking for a non-smoking room .
__label__joy	Thank you for your hospitality . I hope I didn't cause you too much trouble during my stay .
__label__noemo	Oh , yeah ?
__label__noemo	Mary looks so beautiful in the wedding gown , and I record the moment that I was bride .
__label__noemo	Sir , this hotel just passed a thorough insect inspection with flying colors .
__label__noemo	There ’ s a check of two hundred dollars and photograph .
__label__noemo	Hello , miss . Check out please .
__label__noemo	How about a Mac ?
__label__noemo	Yes , but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it's very close . The subway station is next to the hotel . You can walk there .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes . How do you do , Miss Wang ? Sit down , please .
__label__noemo	You just said your English needs work , yes ?
__label__noemo	I will do .
__label__noemo	What vehicle do you usually bring to school ? Is it an automobile or a motorbike ?
__label__noemo	When you wash your dark clothes , can you put some of mine in ?
__label__noemo	do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ?
__label__noemo	Hello , may I help you ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me , but I want a pair of mittens .
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry I can ’ t make it.Thank you anyhow .
__label__noemo	Is anybody here ?
__label__noemo	We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything . We have termites in the wood , cockroaches all over the place , and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard !
__label__noemo	A man came into the bank with a gun .
__label__joy	Thanks for the warning .
__label__noemo	I see . Don't worry , just a common cold .
__label__noemo	There is a laundry form as well as a bag in your room . Pls fill it out and the maid will come pick it up .
__label__noemo	that's true .
__label__noemo	Hello . Could you have a taxi pick me up before 10:00 a . m . ?
__label__noemo	How far is it ?
__label__noemo	So , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ?
__label__noemo	Yes , actually I ’ m looking to buy a camera .
__label__anger	May , look at this mess ! You threw waste everywhere .
__label__joy	Because you are the most handsome boy at the university and I love you so much ! I guess I just go crazy sometimes . That's all .
__label__noemo	Hi , Daddy . It ’ s me , Troy .
__label__noemo	How long will it take to go over all the procedures ?
__label__joy	Easy stuff . But thanks . And the admiration is mutual .
__label__noemo	I'd like a Sprite .
__label__noemo	What do you want me to do ?
__label__noemo	no , I can handle it . Thanks anyway .
__label__noemo	What did she mean just now about raising pigs ?
__label__noemo	Paper or plastic ?
__label__noemo	That's nice . How much is it ?
__label__joy	Good choice ! Our ground beef is extra lean , if you know what I mean .
__label__noemo	Don't you like the sea ?
__label__noemo	Don ’ t be so sure . We may not go anywhere . My wife always worries too much . Who ’ s going to look after the dog ? Who ’ s going to look after the house ? Who ’ s going to look after the garden ? We have t
__label__surprise	That's crazy .
__label__noemo	Many times . I'm really addicted . It's harder to stop than you think .
__label__noemo	Ah I see , so you were actually educated in Europe ?
__label__noemo	In the Golden Mountain Hotel in Beijing .
__label__noemo	Lots of people are ill at the moment .
__label__noemo	Hey , Ann . You don't have a pen , do you ?
__label__noemo	Come on in , please .
__label__noemo	You don't need to lose weight .
__label__noemo	When ’ s the big day ?
__label__noemo	All of the produce is in aisle A .
__label__joy	Thank you , Paul .
__label__noemo	I ’ m afraid a bit more than that . We need to order the spare parts , take apart your electrical system , fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit , because as seller , we also have the problem of funds being tied up .
__label__noemo	Hello , Is this EYE computers ?
__label__noemo	How much dose that cost ?
__label__noemo	it's more than special . You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more .
__label__noemo	How do you spell it , sir ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry , but no . We used to have a trainer , but then he had an unfortunate accident .
__label__noemo	It's in the South of China .
__label__noemo	All right , sir .
__label__noemo	Mary , set your alarm clock for seven tomorrow morning .
__label__noemo	not really . I don't think pop music has much depth .
__label__noemo	What day is it ?
__label__noemo	It depends . It's true that you can take some for prevention .
__label__noemo	To go , please . ( The attendant hands the customer his order . )
__label__noemo	I want some exciting . Which is more fun , the roller coaster or the ferris wheel ?
__label__noemo	I can understand . By the way , is there anyway I can help ?
__label__noemo	No , it's the number fifty-eight .
__label__noemo	No , you give a wrong number .
__label__noemo	Yes . What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Thanks , honey , that was a great meal . I ’ m stuffed . Do we have any chips left ?
__label__noemo	1446 Pine.That ' s in San Francisco , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	May I ask if there's anything wrong with it ?
__label__noemo	Would you like some coffee , Tom ?
__label__sadness	The viewing was for saying goodbye , and I didn't even get that .
__label__joy	port , please .
__label__noemo	How long will it take me to get there ?
__label__noemo	After you
__label__noemo	Adding in your expenses , I calculate that you can spend three hundred thousand on a house .
__label__noemo	You forgot all about it , didn't you ?
__label__noemo	To this place , please .
__label__noemo	What store are you going to ?
__label__noemo	No , I don't . I've never had a bad one before .
__label__noemo	I took a lot of courses , such as Philosophy , Logic , Ethics , Aesthetics , etc .
__label__noemo	No , thanks . I'd like to go straight home . I'm very tired .
__label__noemo	That's all right . How much do they cost ?
__label__noemo	So you have seen her around ?
__label__noemo	Oh , no . I don't think I'm in that good form .
__label__noemo	All right . I know a great restaurant near here.But , it's a little expensive and I don't have much money with me .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'd like to look at some suits .
__label__noemo	What color are her eyes ?
__label__joy	Oh , that's great . I want to try later .
__label__joy	No you ’ re not ! There are some right here !
__label__noemo	Good morning , Star Airline . What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ?
__label__noemo	Do you have a history of high blood pressure ?
__label__noemo	We provide free delivery and installation .
__label__noemo	I will be done before they come .
__label__noemo	Were you in or out ? Can you remember that ?
__label__noemo	Only about two hours , for a couple of days a month . Why don't you give it a try ?
__label__noemo	BET has black shows that are overlooked by mainstream white TV .
__label__surprise	Are you kidding She is behind the times . That style went out last year .
__label__noemo	Where do they come from ?
__label__joy	Not much . She is very tall and slim .
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . What makes you think that ?
__label__noemo	who are you writing a letter to ?
__label__noemo	7 a . m .
__label__noemo	What's the color of her eyes ?
__label__noemo	I see . I think I ’ d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again .
__label__noemo	I prefer potatoes to eggplants .
__label__noemo	OK . I see .
__label__noemo	This is Tim . Hunter from Hunter industries .
__label__noemo	You can find one at the ticket office .
__label__noemo	No , Even a dollar is all right.Here ' s your passbook , sir ; just sign your name on it .
__label__noemo	You did a wonderful job .
__label__noemo	and then ?
__label__noemo	Not belong . You can use them as long as you work here . When you quit , you ’ ll have to return them to the company .
__label__noemo	Ok .
__label__noemo	How many did you say , sir ?
__label__noemo	We have that available .
__label__noemo	Right now , I think I need to really focus on matters at home , but thanks for a nice evening .
__label__noemo	Yes , I already have one .
__label__noemo	I didn ’ t bring cash with me today .
__label__noemo	Who finances the magazine ?
__label__noemo	but what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ?
__label__noemo	I'm afraid the judges do not think so . All the beauty contests are for slim girls only .
__label__noemo	Those stains will be cleaned out of the carpet before you move in .
__label__noemo	How hard is the climb ?
__label__noemo	Green salad please .
__label__noemo	Yeah . I have got much pressure in the company . I have to be wrapped up in my work .
__label__noemo	Oh , sorry to hear that . But , don worry ! Taiwan has plenty of great things to eat . First , lets get you to the hotel .
__label__joy	Constantly . Without doubt , and plays the lute . She has a natural ear .
__label__noemo	I'll talk to you later .
__label__noemo	150 yuan .
__label__noemo	Then what is the problem , sir ?
__label__noemo	everything's great . And you ?
__label__noemo	And what about dinner ?
__label__noemo	Where are the chairs ?
__label__joy	Wow . That sounds really good .
__label__noemo	Oh , you ’ re not listening to me .
__label__noemo	It won't work . I'm nowhere close to being tired .
__label__noemo	It was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser , one small mistake can cost the company millions .
__label__noemo	Thanks . What you need to do now is deposit 100 % of the guaranteed funds of your contract into your account with us .
__label__noemo	I couldn ’ t careless .
__label__noemo	Yes , you do . There is a 300 RIB deposit , which we will refund when you check out . So , in total , you need to pay 1388 RIB .
__label__noemo	My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .
__label__noemo	No . I listened to records and studied , what did you do yesterday , Donald ?
__label__joy	if that happens , then I'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies .
__label__noemo	Ok , then would you please hold the line ? Mr Li , the line is through , Mr Brown is ready answering the call , go ahead .
__label__noemo	Your company's products are mostly marketed in Canada and the United States , but particularly have sold very well here in China . So I think in the future you'll find China to be a profitable market as well .
__label__noemo	Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one .
__label__noemo	I had mine when I was 24 . that ’ s a little young . I ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career .
__label__joy	Yes ! Somebody up there loves me ! I knew it wasn't too late for snow .
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__joy	Goodbye . Thanks again for everything .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real pro
__label__noemo	Oh , four or five . How much is the rent for this apartment ?
__label__joy	See you Borrow .
__label__joy	I've been looking forward to the new semester .
__label__noemo	OK . Don ’ t let it get to you . Goodbye .
__label__noemo	Well , I am worried to death right now ! There is still no news from the company for me .
__label__noemo	Nothing smells a rat . I told you that he's an all-right guy .
__label__noemo	According to the records , your reservation is for a single room with shower and air conditioners for two nights . The room rate will be 110 dollars per night , including 10 % tax and 4 % service charge . Is this right ?
__label__noemo	Could I ask you for a favor ? My laser printer is out of ink and I need to print out something urgent . If you don ’ t mind , I would like to send you these files . Could you then print these for me ?
__label__joy	How about the cinema ?
__label__noemo	I can tell you what bus to catch , but you have to walk a little bit .
__label__noemo	so I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ?
__label__noemo	Miss Wang , how do you do ? I ’ m Allan James , the director of human recourse department of this company .
__label__noemo	Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here .
__label__noemo	Three times a day after meals .
__label__noemo	Just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks .
__label__noemo	I want you to have a walk with me .
__label__noemo	We contact through email .
__label__noemo	Can you make it in 15 mins . I am already 10 mins late .
__label__noemo	I think the starting salary for a salesperson is between 1,500 - 2,000 Yuan . But the specific number will be determined according to your sales .
__label__noemo	Thanks doctor . I ’ ll get these immediately . Goodbye .
__label__noemo	What are we eating for lunch ?
__label__noemo	Can you manage chopsticks ?
__label__noemo	It was three all .
__label__noemo	Sure ! How about the coffee shop right across the street from my office ?
__label__noemo	I would like to order cable .
__label__noemo	I'd love to .
__label__noemo	Well , Tina says she would be able to handle it and concentrate on her own work , easier set them done . But working harder and concentrating only on the job might well helped to overcome the initial stress of the breakup .
__label__noemo	Yes , let's go .
__label__noemo	I want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side .
__label__noemo	What's that ?
__label__noemo	Don't worry , James . We'll get this case worked out in no time .
__label__noemo	Not all of it .
__label__noemo	well , sometimes I get scared when I'm in my apartment all by myself .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__joy	They look delicious . I think she'll be pleased .
__label__noemo	Ok , 90 dollars , do you accept this card ?
__label__noemo	The company is selecting three employees to attend the marketing seminar next month . Did you put your name in for it ?
__label__noemo	Yes , of course . Here are all the tour routes we have to Italy .
__label__noemo	What if this small fever turns into a big fever ?
__label__joy	Did you watch the finale last night ? My favorite singer won !
__label__surprise	That's weird !
__label__disgust	What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ?
__label__noemo	Our maths teacher is rather humorous .
__label__noemo	OK , next time you ’ re here .
__label__joy	I really felt that the service was exceptionally good .
__label__noemo	It's a problem . You'd better move .
__label__noemo	I used to work for a shipping company for six years , and I am quite familiar with some managers . Would your like to meet them ?
__label__joy	This cake is excellent . Where did you buy it ?
__label__noemo	And every best wish for your new job .
__label__noemo	Where would you like to go ?
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__noemo	Yes , that will be easiest .
__label__noemo	Yes , I did . But I couldn't communicate with them in English.They speak only Spanish.So I need your help .
__label__noemo	Okay , I can give you a special discount , just because you seem like a nice person . One hundred and ninety dollars for both .
__label__noemo	Yes . I am going to show them some slides in the meeting . Can you call Mr . Brown to remind him of the dinner this evening ?
__label__noemo	Good gracious ! Are you sure ?
__label__joy	Thank you , thank you , thanks again .
__label__noemo	Yes , Japan is good for farming . Rice is the main crop , but Japan is also an industrial center . Fishing is very important , too . Rice isn't grown in France , is it ?
__label__noemo	Hey , the pool's open now !
__label__noemo	Carrie , are you ok ? You seem a bit down .
__label__sadness	Well , Mr . Brooks . I ’ m sorry , again , for the delay , but we should have everything completed by the time you get back .
__label__noemo	I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves .
__label__noemo	Don't you like red apples ?
__label__joy	I ’ m really glad I got a chance to talk to you before you left , Mary . Have a safe trip !
__label__noemo	Excuse me , could you tell me where you have got that music book ?
__label__noemo	I am a realist .
__label__sadness	I'm afraid I'm going to the gym for a workout .
__label__noemo	I'm sure you'll love it .
__label__joy	Good idea . I think you ’ ll like it if you give it a chance .
__label__noemo	Sorry , I don ’ t know . I ’ m a passengers ’ m waiting for my train ..
__label__joy	I'd like to come back next weekend .
__label__noemo	You've made a good choice.This china tea set is unusual.It was made in Jingdezhen .
__label__noemo	Yes . Is it wrong to lie to them even if it is for their good ?
__label__noemo	Most voters what everything bout ways . They want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes .
__label__joy	Thank you for your help .
__label__joy	Not so soon . It ’ s not my birthday today . Well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ?
__label__noemo	Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
__label__fear	Well , I have acrophobia . I have a chronic fear of flying .
__label__noemo	How much is this shirt ?
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__noemo	I know . However , Jazz always annoys me . I really don't enjoy music in a movie .
__label__noemo	yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams !
__label__noemo	Of course ! Where are the things ?
__label__noemo	Hey , she is not worth it . Forget her .
__label__noemo	I ’ m so sorry ! OK , so you just want a simple message on it .
__label__noemo	What does my white blood cell count tell him ?
__label__noemo	I do wish I could lose weight .
__label__noemo	What was that ?
__label__disgust	I hate working on Christmas Eve ! Whoa ! Get a load of this guy ! Come in central , I think we ’ Ve got ourselves a situation here .
__label__noemo	Good evening , sir . can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Sure . What's your date of delivery ?
__label__noemo	Well , Mary types faster than Jones . But I think Jones types more carefully .
__label__noemo	Yes , I have this time . But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating , can I ask you halfway ?
__label__noemo	Do you have anything published ?
__label__noemo	Sure , I think I know the place .
__label__noemo	We have a good variety . What decade would you like ?
__label__noemo	Here you go . We have your cocktail and there're salad . fried chicken , French fries and vanilla ice cream for dessert . Eat the chicken while it's hot . It tastes better .
__label__noemo	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	A highchair and car seat ! Wow Betty , thank you so much ! I really appreciate it !
__label__noemo	It is so hard to prevent them from being stolen . I also got something this morning .
__label__noemo	Just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company . And you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you .
__label__noemo	Good evening . Would you please offer a table far from the entrance for us ?
__label__noemo	Don't worry , we'll soon fix them .
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome . It was good seeing you again .
__label__noemo	That's wonderful . I want to stay for 2 days .
__label__sadness	I ’ m afraid you ’ re going in the opposite direction .
__label__noemo	OK . I'll take your bet , as long as the winner gets to pick the movie . What about you , Nick ?
__label__noemo	I am thinking about quitting my job in the student government . But before that , I must do my job . Bye . Don't forget about that note .
__label__noemo	Do you have any evidences ?
__label__noemo	And your parents took it badly ?
__label__disgust	I can't think the same .
__label__noemo	Yes , I can . Thank you so much .
__label__noemo	I would like to make one right now .
__label__noemo	You will need to wait a few minutes for fries . They're still in the fryer .
__label__noemo	Do you have an appointment ?
__label__noemo	Taxi !
__label__noemo	Why should I go against her ? She always seems to have better ideas .
__label__noemo	They are too bright .
__label__sadness	I thought so . I felt dizzy this morning .
__label__noemo	What do you usually have for breakfast ? Pancakes or waffles ?
__label__noemo	Oh dad . You don't understand at all .
__label__noemo	That's true . The bus is even worse . Just thinking about taking the bus every day makes me tired ! Hey , how do you get to work every day ?
__label__noemo	I couldn't even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then I'd have to find my own place .
__label__noemo	We can ’ t . if we went that fast , we would break the speed limit .
__label__noemo	Sure , a studio would be fine .
__label__noemo	I heard you are going to move .
__label__noemo	Yes , so you still remember , ah .
__label__noemo	Oh , actually , Tuesday ’ s no good . Sorry about that .
__label__noemo	About $ 25 , tips not included .
__label__noemo	So , I can choose exactly what services I require ? That's brilliant . Can I use the card if I'm overseas to withdraw my daily expenses ?
__label__noemo	I promise .
__label__noemo	I am unsure how to add a class and need help .
__label__noemo	Are you looking for anything else ?
__label__noemo	How have you been doing ?
__label__noemo	I really don't know , but I don't think she gave out that many yet .
__label__noemo	Where would you like to sit ?
__label__joy	Now , I've got it . Thank you .
__label__noemo	Which charges are you talking about ?
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__joy	Good idea . There is a good nightclub nearby , isn't it ?
__label__joy	Sure .
__label__noemo	It's beautiful 75 degrees .
__label__noemo	How about Legally Blonde .
__label__joy	You ’ re so lucky ! Do you have to do many things before you leave ?
__label__joy	Of course . Here is the fitting room .
__label__noemo	About ten weeks in total if everything goes according to plan .
__label__noemo	Yeah ... I keep thinking about what I'll do with a Master's or Doctorate . I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare .
__label__noemo	Have you seen the movie Batwoman ?
__label__noemo	No , nothing . It's thoughtful of you to call me again .
__label__noemo	May I have some water , please ?
__label__noemo	Certainly , madam . I'll just check what we have available . . . Yes , we have a room on the 4th floor with a really splendid view .

__label__noemo	What do you mean ?
__label__noemo	My wife and me . The two of us .
__label__noemo	Why do you need to take the course ?
__label__noemo	As far as the contract stipulations are concerned , there is nothing more . Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	I would like to cash my undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate , please .
__label__noemo	You'll be sorry if the boss finds it out . He may probably give you the bag .
__label__noemo	A thousand dollars .
__label__noemo	Ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ?
__label__noemo	We were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice .
__label__joy	Do you know how to go to the Fragrant Hills in Beijing ? I heard that they are very famous in China .
__label__noemo	Really ?
__label__joy	that's good . Have you met Jane yet ? She's the intern in the international travel department .
__label__noemo	So , what about the chicken ?
__label__joy	Thanks for inviting me . Here is the gift for you . Happy birthday , Francis ! Many more happy and healthy years for you !
__label__noemo	Did you ? And what course did you take there ?
__label__noemo	And I've ordered the supplies .
__label__noemo	Suddenly the ' great outdoors ' isn't so appealing . Let's hike a little faster ...
__label__noemo	Well , I'm not sure . Let's see . How much is this one ?
__label__noemo	Just because he gets on well with everybody ?
__label__noemo	You often like comparing children with their parents .
__label__noemo	No , that ’ s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing .
__label__noemo	You fill in the hours and total them for the week . Have you ever used a 24 hour clock ?
__label__noemo	You know she probably feels just as bad .

__label__anger	You didn't show up to my performance last night ! Some kind of friend you are !
__label__noemo	What do we need to get from the supermarket ?
__label__noemo	You just missed one .
__label__noemo	You should read the book . The original story is much better and has a different twist at the end .
__label__noemo	Show biz stars have plenty of expenses . That ’ s why they need so much money . They need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . I bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and a t-shirt , but they can ’ t because their managers force them to wear clothes they don ’ t like .
__label__surprise	Anne ! I haven't seen you for ages . How've you been ?
__label__noemo	What's wrong with it ?
__label__noemo	Because you don't want to smell bad .
__label__joy	Don't worry about it . It's just a drop in the bucket . That car has more scratches on it than I can count .
__label__joy	that ’ s a good idea . After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear , I can see what new clothes I need to buy .
__label__noemo	I ’ d rather you didn ’ t come immediately as I said I ’ m very busy at the moment . Come after lunch , Mark .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'm calling from Mexico . I will be in town next week and would like to know if you have availability .
__label__noemo	I think a cab is better .
__label__noemo	How long do you plan to stay ?
__label__surprise	Oh , really . I thought he lived with his wife .
__label__joy	Ok . See you tomorrow .
__label__joy	( At the zoo ) Wow ! This zoo is really huge .
__label__noemo	Some people are easily flimflammed .
__label__noemo	All right . Please be quick about it .
__label__noemo	I understand .
__label__noemo	I am quite active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like leaving things half done .
__label__noemo	I received my bachelor's degree from Peking University in 2004 .
__label__joy	Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ?
__label__noemo	Or a curse .
__label__noemo	It depends on the job . It's actually more cost-effective than buying specialist equipment that we don't use very often .
__label__noemo	All right , then . See you this afternoon .
__label__noemo	A white one , please .
__label__noemo	Well , apparently , he's been having an affair with his secretary .
__label__noemo	Since he doesn ’ t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way , all of his daughters will be cared for .
__label__noemo	Well , I'll just buy the shirt .
__label__noemo	Leo , I really think you ’ re beating around the bush with this guy . I know he used to be your best friend in college , but I really think it ’ s time to lay down the law .
__label__noemo	I will think about it .
__label__noemo	Yes , I am . Are you Miss Li from the travel agency ?
__label__noemo	Some dude came into the bank with a gun .
__label__noemo	Great . Can you file in English ?
__label__noemo	Sir , each copy is ten cents or one dime , whichever you prefer .
__label__noemo	You'll need to fill in this application form and there is a charge of 30 US dollars for this .
__label__noemo	How much is the fare , please ?
__label__noemo	"actually , this is a kind of addiction called "" infomania "" or "" information overload "" ."
__label__noemo	What would make this apartment better for you ?
__label__noemo	Aright . I'll meet you at the gym at 3:30 then .
__label__noemo	Did you see Victor on Wednesday , Wendy ?
__label__noemo	Do you have any bug spray ?
__label__noemo	Yes . Twice .
__label__noemo	By the way , what's your last name ? I forgot what it is .
__label__noemo	Great . What do you suggest we see ?
__label__noemo	So it is really worth your great effort . And hope you can keep the record you've made today .
__label__joy	And listen to this ! What do you think of sailing , swimming , windsurfing , and fishing ?
__label__noemo	Hi , Charlie ! What are you reading ?
__label__noemo	What is it , dear ?
__label__noemo	Sure . What time do you want to go ?
__label__joy	I'm so happy for you .
__label__noemo	I ’ d like to . But Bob , are you sure it will be all right ? I would hate you to make your boss angry or even lose your job .
__label__noemo	How was your appraisal with the boss ?
__label__noemo	How do you think the report I wrote ?
__label__noemo	Oh , that's George . He looks very drunk .
__label__noemo	I'll be worried if you stay out late .
__label__noemo	hi , come on in . Can I take your coat ?
__label__noemo	There are advertisements everywhere here in hong kong . The city is so bright at night , with all the neon signs .
__label__noemo	Yes , assuming there's been no damage to the apartment . Before you move in , you can make a list of any marks , scratches , and so forth that are already there .
__label__joy	It's certainly a big improvement over yesterday .
__label__noemo	I didn't take my temperature but I felt feverish .
__label__noemo	Hello . City News . Can I help you ?
__label__sadness	I feel confused about the grammars .
__label__noemo	It is possible to take into account special circumstances , should the manager agree to it . If your credit rating has been class A in your initial trading period and your debt to asset ratio is sound , and then I'm sure the manager will see you to discuss it further . I'll set up a meeting for you .
__label__noemo	I'm looking for information on tropical fish .
__label__noemo	Okay . That sounds like a winner . Now if I need to print something in the lobby ?
__label__noemo	no , of course not . Go ahead .
__label__joy	That's great ; I can give an extra key to my wife . I feel perfectly comfortable with her having a key . Thanks for your help .

__label__joy	Thank you , Mrs Smith . It is really a pleasure talking with you .
__label__joy	Mom , look , that cake looks delicious . My mouth is watering .
__label__noemo	These are new arrivals .
__label__noemo	What do you think of the leading actors ?
__label__noemo	I want to mail this package .
__label__noemo	I don't think it's broken .
__label__noemo	Do you really believe in that ? If they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights .
__label__noemo	Good afternoon , welcome to IBA . How can I be of service ?
__label__noemo	Yes . This is Mr . Wang in Room 1305 . Please send up a boy to help me with my luggage .
__label__noemo	I think that the percentage is incorrect .
__label__noemo	Why ? Just read your notes.You can see what the professor stressed in the lectures.Probably the exam will ask about things he stressed .
__label__joy	How can we do that ?
__label__noemo	Do you have any breaks ?
__label__noemo	Kate , can we change the channel ?
__label__noemo	On the contrary , very exciting .
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__noemo	Do you think you can fix my computer ?
__label__noemo	Is that all right ?
__label__noemo	The unit price is $ 12.50 .
__label__noemo	I am equipped with much experience in teaching for more than 30 years and I also edit teaching materials by myself .
__label__noemo	Why would you park in the red zone ?
__label__joy	Women love roses , so your wife will be very happy .
__label__noemo	What's the matter ?
__label__surprise	And look what we did to him ! Hey ... he left me his business card .
__label__noemo	It's still early .
__label__noemo	Well , I was born in Shanghai and went to school there , right up through college . My father is a lawyer , and my mother is a teacher .
__label__noemo	Hello , Parker . How ’ s everything ?
__label__noemo	Do you drink much ?
__label__noemo	Yeah .
__label__noemo	A soft seat or hard one ?
__label__noemo	she asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today . When are you free today ?
__label__joy	I'm glad to see you !
__label__noemo	No doubt . Look , I'm just browsing . If I need your help , I'll let you know .
__label__noemo	Me too . Seems like all I do is eat and sleep .
__label__joy	he is tall and slim , fair-haired .
__label__noemo	Do you still see the people we went to school with ?
__label__noemo	345 Stony Creek Avenue .
__label__noemo	Hi , Mary , Hi , Ken I hate to bring this up , but that new stereo , system you got ...
__label__noemo	you're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down .
__label__noemo	Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive .
__label__noemo	He's an old antique , very serious .
__label__noemo	Well , I was born in Ohio , but I grew up in Texas .
__label__joy	It seems to me that you are on very good terms with him .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__noemo	Your offering price is not out-of-line . The owners will either take it or make a counter-offer .
__label__noemo	it's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift
__label__joy	my pleasure . Let's go and have a drink .
__label__noemo	How long is the holiday ?
__label__noemo	What's the date today ?
__label__noemo	Good question . But I will tell you when you pass the first two .
__label__noemo	Hey Mike . I forgot about registration . I'm a day late , so all the classes are mostly full . What do you think I should do ?
__label__joy	Well that's great ! It's nice that we have something in common .
__label__noemo	She was right to do that . I heard the Neil and Tina getting married soon .
__label__noemo	Maybe another time . People say that boys ' dormitories are in a mess , is it true ?
__label__noemo	Mr . Crane ’ s office . Sandy speaking . May I help you ?
__label__joy	I can ’ t believe that Anthony is finally getting married !
__label__noemo	Oh , I've heard about him before . He even created a special dance of sleeve shaking .
__label__noemo	it must have been a few years ago now .
__label__joy	What a great idea .
__label__noemo	Why do you say so ?
__label__noemo	There are another six stops .
__label__noemo	That's terrible . Do many people die in tornadoes ?
__label__joy	That sounds so interesting . I wish I learned a hobby .
__label__noemo	I think that they get a pretty good payoff .
__label__disgust	You can keep the cat , but you should keep it away from me .
__label__noemo	Medium .
__label__noemo	She isn't messing up in class ?
__label__sadness	Sorry , but this is the best price . You can ’ t get it any cheaper than here .
__label__noemo	You would fit both of them in your bedroom . Perhaps you could also get the dressing table . I think that one would look good in your bedroom .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Whatever , I think I ’ m gonna get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well .
__label__noemo	Let ’ s have a look . Mmmm . This doesn ’ t look too good . I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth . It ’ s pressing against your molars and that ’ s one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain
__label__noemo	Excuse me , what's the time difference between Tokyo and London ?
__label__noemo	Maybe we can enjoy the TV play together . It's interesting .
__label__noemo	You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ?
__label__joy	good luck !
__label__noemo	Sure.Step in .
__label__noemo	Indoors activities , such as chess and gymnastics .

__label__joy	Thanks , Mom !
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__noemo	Here is a little gift for your family . It's a calendar with all the community events on it . I hope it can be helpful .
__label__surprise	I've got a schedule !
__label__noemo	I hear that Mary got mad .
__label__noemo	Nah , I wouldn't worry about that . But I don't want to be the third wheel . You two should have some quiet time to yourselves .
__label__noemo	Our company is in Pudding new area in Shanghai .
__label__sadness	No , Madam . I don't think I do .
__label__noemo	it was fantastic , but I'm glad to be back ! Being a tourist is really tiring !
__label__noemo	Room service.May I come in ?
__label__noemo	Of course not . For me , mountaineering is both relaxation and a hobby .
__label__noemo	Really ? Have you left it in your room ?
__label__joy	Then I'll shoot some pictures , re-size the images and upload them with text descriptions to my blog .
__label__noemo	Well , now we should turn back a few kilometres .
__label__noemo	What are you talking about ? What did I do ?
__label__joy	How about taking a walk in the park ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to send it by regular mail .
__label__noemo	It looks like there are a lot of people inside .
__label__noemo	I am great . How are you ?
__label__noemo	Guess who I saw just now ?
__label__noemo	Is it important ?
__label__noemo	Well , I haven't got much either !
__label__noemo	What research ?
__label__surprise	Really ? Why not ?
__label__noemo	You're here to make a deposit , is that correct ?
__label__noemo	If you order a large amount , we can give you a discount .
__label__noemo	Just a couple of days ago .
__label__noemo	It really was . You should've gone .
__label__noemo	Ok , then we can sign up for it together .
__label__noemo	No . It wasn't the super bargain I thought it was .
__label__noemo	Sure , what do you need ?
__label__noemo	May's birthday is coming . Shall we buy her a birthday present or let her choose one for herself ?
__label__noemo	They are very uncomfortable . But women always wear uncomfortable shoes !
__label__noemo	I think I can handle it by myself .
__label__noemo	Is she chubby ?
__label__noemo	What ’ s the matter , dear ?
__label__noemo	It's already half past four . We should go and pay our respects . Taylor's family will be there .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . which way is to the post office ?
__label__noemo	Of course , that's all part of the service .
__label__noemo	Good morning . I bought this vacuum here a few months ago . It doesn ’ t work now . Can I return it or get it fixed ?
__label__joy	Thank you . The payment needs to be in the form of cash or a cashier ’ s check .
__label__noemo	I can't catch the bus with you anymore .
__label__noemo	when you find out you get the promotion or not , let me know .
__label__noemo	It's made of genuine ivory , besides , it's of exquisite workmanship . The price is marked 200 yuan .
__label__noemo	Good morning , mom .
__label__noemo	Yes , I hope I will be a manager in 5 years .
__label__noemo	Right , I'll contact my guarantor now and we'll come in within the next couple of days . Thanks very much for your help . Goodbye .
__label__joy	Let's get all the balls out of the pockets .
__label__noemo	So , that'll be a call at 7 and another at 7 thirty.Do you have any other requests ?
__label__joy	Sure . Let ’ s go . What are you going to have done ?
__label__noemo	You come dressed in anything from the sixties .
__label__noemo	why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air .
__label__noemo	Do you think they two will get married ?
__label__noemo	Yes , and I'm a very good driver .
__label__noemo	Try this one , please . This is made of real leather and is very soft . How is it ?
__label__noemo	Oh , she did ? Then it's a used car of course .
__label__joy	would you mind if I helped out in the kitchen instead ? I do enjoy cooking .
__label__noemo	Regarding what exactly ?
__label__noemo	When will it be working again ?
__label__noemo	But you should avoid finger-pointing when you haven ’ t got the real facts .
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__anger	To hell with you . The accident was your fault .
__label__noemo	Right , I figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses .
__label__noemo	Right now he speaks mostly Chinese , and he can say a few English words . But he will learn .
__label__noemo	Oh , she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class . She doesn't mind your making mistakes , though .
__label__noemo	You can deposit an initial amount of ten dollars .
__label__noemo	Why are you so calm ? Are you not surprised to hear this ?
__label__disgust	They promised us a sea view .
__label__joy	Oh , that's quite convenient . Thank you .
__label__noemo	Did you do you own stunts in the movie ?
__label__noemo	Have I really got to do those exams again , Dad ?
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__noemo	Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country .
__label__noemo	You are a lucky man . How about Mr . Smith .
__label__noemo	Which season do you like best ?
__label__noemo	How scary can it be ? Come on , it'll be fun .
__label__noemo	You mean because you are a woman ?
__label__noemo	No , they live alone .
__label__noemo	If you could just talk to him , I would greatly appreciate it .
__label__noemo	What makes you angry ?
__label__noemo	Not much , usually I'll just keep silent .
__label__noemo	You mother is not only a patient mother but also a gentle wife .
__label__surprise	What ’ s wrong ?
__label__noemo	Let me see . The bell-bottom pants are $ 90 and the coat is $ 120 . It comes to $ 210 .
__label__noemo	Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction . It's hard work .
__label__anger	It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !
__label__noemo	I live in Altadena .
__label__noemo	Thank you very much for your evaluation . I also like this job very much .
__label__noemo	Yes , it's true . It has been delayed .
__label__noemo	Didn't they say we're going to the Ritz ?
__label__joy	I'd love to .
__label__noemo	I'd like a double room .
__label__noemo	No , he doesn't . But his wife found out he has been too charming for a long time.Incredibly , he has many different girlfriends . Starting almost right after they married 20 years ago .
__label__noemo	Do you know what the minimum balance is ?
__label__noemo	I don ’ t blame you . Perhaps you could sublet it .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , does this bus go to the new bookstore ?
__label__noemo	It's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there's a chance of freezing rain .
__label__noemo	I'm going to go get a pair for myself .
__label__noemo	May I help you , sir ?
__label__noemo	Depends ? Depends on what ?
__label__noemo	So what ?
__label__noemo	Go ahead .
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve got two tickets for a newly released film . Would you like to see it with me ?
__label__noemo	I think that I will mail it in right away when I get it next time , so I won ’ t be late .
__label__noemo	Is it always cold in Chicago and Boston ?
__label__noemo	Hi . What can I get for you ?
__label__noemo	Not surprising . I bet she's very tall and slim .
__label__joy	Very good . We'll meet at 6 . Do you need directions ?
__label__noemo	Study English .
__label__noemo	do you have your passport with you ?
__label__noemo	Did you intern anywhere ?
__label__noemo	You mean on product availability , reliability and price ?
__label__noemo	What's the fare ?
__label__joy	You're welcome . We wish you a speedy recovery.Goodbye .
__label__noemo	Have you obtained any certificate of technical qualifications or license ?
__label__noemo	We have a three-shift system - that's three eight-hour shifts each weekday . We're shut at weekends . This week I'm on the early shift .
__label__noemo	Mrs . Smith , what do you do for work ?
__label__noemo	Did you go to a real estate agent ?
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__noemo	Yeah , it ’ s pretty nice , but its so red because of air pollution .
__label__noemo	Let ’ s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ’ t spend much . Come on . Don ’ t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ’ t we ?
__label__noemo	Straight ahead to the traffic lights , left and then right .
__label__noemo	Okay , now you really have to fill me in . What ’ s he like ?
__label__sadness	Sorry , sir . That table has been booked .
__label__noemo	Oh , he's fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays .
__label__noemo	Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door .
__label__noemo	All right .
__label__noemo	How long is the ride ?
__label__joy	OK , I'll talk to you soon .
__label__noemo	You have to experience this if you want to be an extraordinary reporter .
__label__noemo	Where shall we sit ?
__label__noemo	OK , here you are .
__label__joy	My pleasure ! This tea towel ’ s a little ragged . Do you have another one ?
__label__joy	Yeah ! Where there is a will , there is a way .
__label__noemo	The Great Wall is a great attraction for visitors .
__label__noemo	Yes , I ’ m quite satisfied with your qualifications .
__label__noemo	You are a lost cause .
__label__noemo	You can send a compressed one .
__label__noemo	I feel terrible , I really didn ’ t mean to knock you over . My tire , just exploded , and I lost control of my bike . Really , it was an accident . Please accept my apologies .
__label__noemo	It's not worth it .
__label__joy	Thank you , ma'am . It's been a pleasure doing business with you .
__label__noemo	Where did this come from ?
__label__noemo	as far as I know , insomnia is usually caused by stress . Are you stressed at all ?
__label__noemo	Oh , you mean palm reading 5 . I've seen that before , but I don't believe in it .
__label__noemo	Thank you , sir . May I have your name and phone number , please ?
__label__noemo	Well , the only free food on the streets is from a soup kitchen , and their soup isn't as tasty as mine !
__label__noemo	French dressing , please .
__label__noemo	Mr . Smith , I'm wondering whether you have found a way of considering my offer ?
__label__noemo	Do you think it's suitable for me ?
__label__noemo	I will be there half an hour early .
__label__noemo	No , and let me tell you why ... If I make my guys stay over to check the inventory , I'll have to pay them at an overtime rate , which is time and a half . I estimate it will probably take 3 guys two hours to finish , that will be an increase on your labor fee by at least 10 % ... if you need the numbers that urgently , I can have them do it . Otherwise , we can wait until tomorrow morning , and I'll call you with the numbers after they're done . It's your call ...
__label__noemo	You don't know where you want to look for one ?
__label__noemo	Mom , I'm ready for school .
__label__noemo	That ’ s the one .
__label__noemo	Well , I've lost my wallet and my ID card .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . Do you know how to get to the mall ?
__label__noemo	No , I'm fine .
__label__noemo	Do you often go to watch sports games ?
__label__noemo	I know what you are talking about . The performance evaluation process starts from the day we're hired . There is no surprise during the actual review .
__label__noemo	I can do this for you . Don't worry .
__label__noemo	Consumer Credit Department . How may I help you ?
__label__noemo	Sir , you'll be pleased to know that our gym never closes .
__label__noemo	Of course , such as Alabama , which is a famous website .
__label__surprise	Teachers ? I didn't think that they would be racist at all .
__label__noemo	You're pretty lucky actually , today is higher than yesterday . It's 824 . 71 RIB for 100 USD .
__label__noemo	The son gave a nice speech about his father .
__label__noemo	Yes ... I wouldn ’ t recommend it .
__label__noemo	Oh , what's this ? Second-hand cellphone store ?
__label__noemo	Yes , especially in spring .
__label__noemo	Wonder why they do that !
__label__noemo	not as far as I know . We have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! That ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv , where you pay a fixed amount each mo
__label__noemo	it reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world .
__label__noemo	Here is my card . Can I have them delivered to this address ?
__label__noemo	Sure they are .
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__noemo	Nearly ten years .
__label__joy	Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's hidden feelings , and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll nor break-dancing .
__label__noemo	Are you married ?
__label__noemo	Ann invited us to dinner this saturday afternoon .
__label__noemo	We've taken on a civil engineer on a nine-month temporary contract . He'll oversee the whole project . In fact we're having a project meeting at 3 p . m this afternoon allocate responsibilities and finalise the time schedule . Why don't you join us ?
__label__noemo	But it's true .
__label__noemo	Today is Friday . Are you new in Beijing ?
__label__noemo	And I suppose sitting at a desk all day at the office doesn't help .
__label__noemo	What are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ?
__label__surprise	Oh , yeah ?
__label__noemo	In a month .
__label__noemo	Yes . That's small bag of sugar , four oranges , and a half gallon of milk .
__label__noemo	What should I do , doctor ?
__label__noemo	Would I have to get my parents to guarantor the loan ?
__label__noemo	I understand . So , what would you like to do with the balance ?
__label__noemo	150 a month .
__label__noemo	Oh , no . I want to withdraw from my U . S . dollars savings account .
__label__noemo	I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house .
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__noemo	I'm afraid not . But at tomorrow's funeral , the family requested an open casket service .
__label__joy	I see.Thank you .
__label__noemo	OK , I will .
__label__joy	I'm glad you like it .
__label__noemo	There's no need to apologize .
__label__noemo	Which is your favorite in this ten ?
__label__surprise	Oh ? What happened ?
__label__noemo	What is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space ?
__label__surprise	What ? Do you mean that you are pregnant ? Is it true ?
__label__noemo	I have only worked at this job for 6 months , but I have a longer job history elsewhere .
__label__noemo	Where's your girlfriend ? I thought you were going out with her today .
__label__noemo	Generally speaking , training new members is usually necessary . We offer our new employees a one-week training course .
__label__disgust	The water there looks so dirty .
__label__surprise	What ! How am I supposed to get to school or go shopping ? This is not happening !
__label__surprise	Oh ! I'm sorry , but I wish you could stay .
__label__noemo	I hope so . I think you will get a big bonus too . Bonus depends on your performance and you worked overtime almost every day .
__label__noemo	Where to , miss ?
__label__noemo	we just moved in yesterday , actually .
__label__joy	what a nice uniform !
__label__noemo	We usually go to the cafeteria .
__label__noemo	And I will bring my textbook and a tape recorder . I would like to record some things so I can practice on my own .
__label__noemo	I would take it . After all , interest is not the only thing one should care about .
__label__noemo	It's always hot in June , July and August . The sun shines every day .
__label__surprise	He can repair cares ? I cannot believe it .
__label__noemo	Do all jobs provide unemployment ?
__label__anger	I know where to put my card ! Stupid machine , talking to me like I ’ m an idiot ...
__label__noemo	How do you think people get their personalities ?
__label__noemo	Our maths teacher is rather humorous .
__label__noemo	What was your problem ?
__label__noemo	Why not ? It is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking .
__label__noemo	It's brown .
__label__noemo	I take it you've done this before ?
__label__noemo	That'll be fine .
__label__noemo	Thanks . Do you sell aspirin here ?
__label__noemo	Bingo !
__label__noemo	I came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . I think I like the black leather suite . It ’ s on sale , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	Did you ? I didn't hear you . It was too noisy .
__label__joy	well that's great news ! Congratulations ! Where will you be located ?
__label__noemo	how's your assistant manager getting on ?
__label__noemo	Our maths teacher is rather humorous .
__label__noemo	To be frank , I find philosophy rather boring .
__label__noemo	Well , when he sobered up , he called someone from work to come and bail him out .
__label__noemo	What's your meaning ?
__label__noemo	Please explain why you are interested in leaving your current position and please elaborate on your technical skills .
__label__noemo	Then you haven't browsed eBay before ... get online . Don't hang up !
__label__noemo	I heard that you are interested in our silk skirts and new style of coats .
__label__joy	Yes , many thanks . Goodbye .
__label__joy	Forget about him . Come over to my house tonight . Let's get drunk .
__label__surprise	Why ? You are so excellent . I think you are the most suitable person for the job .
__label__noemo	This one is 5 % off . That one has no reduction , but you can get a free tube of toothpaste with six toothbrushes .
__label__surprise	really ? What do you usually do online ?
__label__noemo	Yes , the swimming pool is right behind the building . Walk out of the door and you will see it .
__label__noemo	I'm going to graduate this summer .
__label__noemo	Do you have any direct flights to Toronto ?
__label__sadness	Very badly , doctor .
__label__noemo	Hello . I want to purchase an old music box .
__label__noemo	How much does it cost ?
__label__noemo	Hi Jane , can you let me know the best way to get to your house this evening ?
__label__noemo	Well ... actually ... I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me ... I ’ Ve just been so nervous .
__label__noemo	How much is all that ? I don ’ t have much cash . Can I give you a check ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I had a wonderful time .
__label__noemo	What do you think we can see during the festival ?
__label__noemo	What is the most important factor ?
__label__noemo	Good idea .
__label__surprise	Again ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . Where's Mexico ?
__label__noemo	Hello ? Ms . Patterson ? This is Bill from Workmate calling . I'm just wondering if you had a chance to look over the estimate I sent for your gala dinner project next month ... As I said in my email , we can help you with production according to your needs , but we will only be able to give insite management support services on a limited basis .
__label__noemo	Is there anything wrong ?
__label__noemo	You are always so naughty .
__label__noemo	Thanks . I don't suppose you have some paper , too .
__label__surprise	Really ? I ’ Ve never heard of it !
__label__joy	The weather is gorgeous here .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t know . I think it ’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money . They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax , for example .
__label__noemo	How long have you been working there ?
__label__noemo	We need to work is because we need money to live . We need money for food and clothes and to pay for our house . We need money for many different things , and only when we work , we can earn money . And work can also help us feel that we are useful .
__label__noemo	I just got back from London .
__label__noemo	All right . Can I serve you anything else ?
__label__joy	That is right up my alley . You say party and I'm there .
__label__noemo	It better be more than last year .
__label__noemo	I think so . I set it by the radio this morning .
__label__noemo	My favorite books are those about detectives .
__label__noemo	then SOHO is your ideal work style .
__label__noemo	Good evening , sir . What's your pleasure this evening ? Your usual ?
__label__noemo	In my opinion , overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports .
__label__noemo	I park in the evenings .
__label__noemo	We've heard about that festival before . It would be quite helpful if you could give us some highlights of the festival .
__label__noemo	The old man is knocked down by the bicycle .
__label__joy	Maybe I should make a plan about learning my biochemistry , which is a mess !
__label__noemo	Certainly , Sir . You do have a Current Account with us right ?
__label__noemo	My first job was in a well-established company where the division of labour was very clear . I do not have more chances to enrich my experience . Then I got an opportunity to really broaden my experience with a new company that was starting up , but unfortunately , they closed their service in three months ' time . I have worked in my present company for a considerable length of time and enjoy the job I am doing now , but I think I have accumulated enough experience to take up more challenging post in a much larger and diversified company where I could make solid contribution .
__label__noemo	Not a great week for the world ! Any good news ?
__label__joy	Thank you so much .
__label__noemo	Maybe we should try a thai massage too .
__label__noemo	I'd like to book the standard room .
__label__noemo	There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick .
__label__noemo	Hello , sir . Have you reserved already ?
__label__noemo	Indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater .
__label__joy	I like the novels of Dickens very much . I've read almost all of them in Chinese translation .
__label__joy	What a beautiful day !
__label__noemo	I just graduated from high school .
__label__noemo	Maybe you're right . But I just still can't understand ...
__label__noemo	We produce household cleaning products - detergents and so on . They are all phosphate-free , which minimises damage to the environment .
__label__noemo	No , not at all . Go ahead .
__label__noemo	( while shaking hands ) I am Zhang Wei , nice to meet you , sir .
__label__noemo	I am so sorry , madam !
__label__noemo	I can offer you 5 , 000 yuan per month . Raises are given after three months ' probation period according to your performance . Is this satisfactory ?
__label__noemo	Well , I don't think I want it .
__label__sadness	My drives were terrible today . I kept slicing the ball into the roughs and sand traps .
__label__joy	I guess I asked the wrong person .
__label__noemo	twenty of them are going abroad to China and America .
__label__noemo	Yes , please . I'd like a cigarette , too . May I have one ?
__label__noemo	Why did you call me ?
__label__joy	Oh , he is all right . But busy as usual . Well , why don't we have a good chat at a bar ? It's been long time since we met each other last time .
__label__noemo	What's wrong with you , young man ?
__label__noemo	I am worried about that Arden will display all my drawbacks in the performance review . That will be embarrassing .
__label__noemo	It ’ s Tuesday today . I always go to my class on Tuesday night .
__label__noemo	yes , I've read them many times . I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters .
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve got a new boss .
__label__anger	No way . I've given you too many chances already .
__label__noemo	I try to be sensible about it , but it's not very easy . Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it .
__label__noemo	That's correct .
__label__noemo	All right . That nearly done a little.Now I want you to look some pictures .
__label__noemo	OK , we will pay insurances for employees after the probationary period .
__label__noemo	No . What did it say ?
__label__joy	Come off it , Mary .
__label__noemo	Tomorrow is my wife's birthday .
__label__noemo	I can't believe my eyes , Bill . Are you having a salad for lunch ? No hamburger ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	How long will you work a day ?
__label__noemo	Tom , you're my good friend , right ?
__label__surprise	You've got be joking .
__label__noemo	Hide me , Yi-jun ! The kids all think I'm the real Easter bunny !
__label__noemo	So , have you been on the bus very long ?
__label__noemo	It's no picnic .
__label__noemo	Sure . Any specific reason I should know about in case people ask where you are .
__label__noemo	Is there anything else I will need to provide ?
__label__noemo	Yes . My name ’ s Mark Benson . I just started a couple of weeks ago .
__label__noemo	Yes , I ’ m doing some research on Roman civilization . Do you have any books on the subject ?
__label__noemo	Thanks .
__label__noemo	I think so , because most young people like modern dances , such as rock and roll .
__label__noemo	All right . I'm afraid this green dress is too small for me as well . It's smaller than the blue one . I don't like the colour either . It doesn't suit me at all . I think the blue dress is prettier . Co
__label__noemo	In winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that.the streets are often icing in the morning.with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
__label__noemo	I would like to know the state of the residential property market right now because I have an apartment to sell .
__label__noemo	I can give you a reservation on flight No CZ 387 on July 22nd .
__label__noemo	Actually , would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks ?
__label__noemo	Do you know any secrets to China's success ?
__label__noemo	Are you sure this is the right restaurant 。
__label__noemo	Yes , twice now . I think it's too high-tech , and so it's the first part that breaks .
__label__sadness	I don ’ t know what I ’ m going to do ! It ’ s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job !
__label__joy	It is beautiful .
__label__noemo	It serves her right !
__label__noemo	Why only $ 300 ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me for being late to work .
__label__anger	What happened to you last night ? You didn ’ t show up .
__label__noemo	Has all the work done by men been replaced by automatic computers ?
__label__noemo	He is out of luck .
__label__joy	OK , I will try . As for stamp , don't you think it is an expensive hobby ?
__label__noemo	You didn ’ t tell me you were working there this year .
__label__noemo	Yes , sir . It'll be a moment .
__label__noemo	Fine !
__label__joy	In my spare time , I am fond of traveling and I always take a trip with my family .
__label__noemo	Well , you get used to it , different countries have different manners .
__label__joy	Yes , I always cry at weddings .
__label__noemo	All right , Mr . Smith . I will arrange a table for 5 at 12:00 for you .
__label__surprise	Really ? What was the matter ?
__label__noemo	Did you think about talking to her again ? Maybe she is waiting for your call .
__label__noemo	Alright , let's go .
__label__noemo	What can be done then ?
__label__noemo	Our most elegant flower is Golden Lily .
__label__noemo	Why don't you try to give it up ?
__label__noemo	OK . Here you are .
__label__noemo	Let me see if he is free . Would you please sit down and wait for a moment ?
__label__joy	It's nice of you to say so .
__label__noemo	Fine , please .
__label__noemo	I'm going to study .
__label__noemo	Either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel .
__label__disgust	I think it is the worst one I have ever seen .
__label__noemo	May I please speak to Tom ?
__label__noemo	I see . Thank you .
__label__noemo	So let me show you some of our DVD players.In my opinion , DVD is the wave of the future .
__label__noemo	That's it . It'll take you about five minutes .
__label__noemo	I remember that I never saw an X moves even displayed .
__label__noemo	Some woman in here when I tried to register three weeks ago . She said I just had to pay a late fee .
__label__noemo	I know what you mean , but I'd better remind them again , and also remind them to repair the button in the elevator for the disabled people . That has brought the disabled people lots of inconvenience .
__label__joy	Sure can .
__label__noemo	OK . I will deposit my bag right now .
__label__noemo	Ok already . I'll try .
__label__noemo	No , I don't know where that is .
__label__noemo	May I help you , sir ?
__label__noemo	According to their scheme , it will begin on September 10th .
__label__noemo	Uh , I don't know what to say . What do you want to know ?
__label__noemo	Sweet.Can you tell me where it is ?
__label__noemo	This one . How do you like it ?
__label__noemo	I'm buckled up . What's next ?
__label__noemo	I'm Mr . Stephen's secretary . He has an appointment with Mr . Green today .
__label__joy	Oh , it's Jack . Excuse me .
__label__noemo	The radio has too many comerials .
__label__noemo	Along Queen's Road ...
__label__noemo	Did you hear who won the election ?
__label__noemo	Do I have to write the invitation cards ?
__label__noemo	I want to check these three pieces and I'll carry this overnight bag by myself .
__label__noemo	Just a couple of weeks ago . It's usually very reliable .
__label__noemo	Well , I've been browsing online , but I ’ m not really sure what to do about payment . I would like to know what the most convenient way to do it is .
__label__noemo	Easy . View the home page of the company , and see if they need staff . Many websites offer two-way service , such as job-hunting and talent hunting .
__label__noemo	Yes . It was starving and looking for something to eat when I saw it .
__label__noemo	Not really .
__label__noemo	Yes , come in please . I am Mr . Li . You must be My Liu , right ?
__label__noemo	I'm here to conduct the annual census of foreigners living in Beijing . This is my service ID card .
__label__noemo	Have you got any selling experience at all ?
__label__noemo	Do you have any going anywhere in the EU ? If you do , those are less expensive .
__label__noemo	I'm so tired ! I don't know how I'm going to make it through this lecture .
__label__noemo	Where are the keys ?
__label__noemo	Have you got anything to declare ?
__label__noemo	OK , I know where this is going . How much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
__label__noemo	Single or return ?
__label__joy	Yes , it's beautiful weather we're having .
__label__joy	I'll go through the materials that you have given me and return shortly . Thanks .
__label__noemo	What in the world is that smell ?
__label__noemo	Hi , Jason . It ’ s Elizabeth Montgomery . Have you got those plans drawn up yet ?
__label__noemo	Hello , I ’ m the landlord . John Taylor .
__label__joy	Yeah ! When I got my nose job I was black and blue for a week !
__label__joy	Yes . Wait for me at the cafe down my office building . Say 5 PM , ok ?
__label__noemo	What else would you like to add ? We highly recommend caterpillar fungus .
__label__noemo	OK . Do you want to ask the receptionist to wait for our customers at the receptionist counter before the meeting ?
__label__noemo	She's another applicant , and a leading contender , but I didn ’ t want to hire her . She ’ s qualified , but she doesn ’ t quite fit the profile . We ’ re looking for an accountant , and part of the job requires interacting with clients . Well , our clients want conservative people to handle their money . And green hair with ripped jeans doesn ’ t exactly fill them with trust .
__label__surprise	I thought you were making dinner tonight .
__label__noemo	Oh I still haven ’ t managed to get any tickets . I ’ d love to see something though .
__label__noemo	Yeah . Is Cindy up ?
__label__noemo	not really . I was being sarcastic . Does it come with the job ?
__label__noemo	Have you got a headache ?
__label__noemo	I'm starving , as I didn't eat yet today .
__label__noemo	Yes , I was the top student among my classmates .
__label__noemo	Good.That is the kind of man we are looking for.By the way , do you like traveling ? Our sales representatives need to travel a lot .
__label__noemo	It must be old .
__label__noemo	What is your understanding of a job ?
__label__noemo	Tell me which direction it should be going .
__label__noemo	Yes , sir . How about the sideburns ?
__label__joy	Yes , Todd , how nice to hear your voice !
__label__noemo	I hear what you're saying , and I wish there were something I could do .
__label__noemo	I see . But , many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans .
__label__noemo	That's a good idea .
__label__noemo	Yes , quality is even more than the quantity .
__label__noemo	Where is the fitting room ?
__label__joy	You are welcome . I ’ d better go . Goodbye .
__label__noemo	It's July 16,2009 .
__label__noemo	I see . When did it start ?
__label__noemo	The acting of this film is marvelous in spite of the thin plot .
__label__noemo	Are you married ?
__label__noemo	Hold on , my ears are still ringing from the music ... what was it you asked me ?
__label__noemo	I'm working on Saturday mornings this month.Are you getting up ?
__label__noemo	There's no price tag on this necklace .
__label__noemo	... and taste a few ! There will be wines from several countries and an expert to give advice on which wines are good and which ones are not .
__label__noemo	Yes . I'd like to look at lipstick and eye shadow .
__label__noemo	That is merely a dream . Remember , there is always room for us to have further improvement . I think we did the good job in the whole period .
__label__noemo	No , of course not . I ’ Ve got a lot to learn yet . In the meantime , I just want to be a good secretary and not step on anyone ’ s toes .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry , sir . I can't interrupt her . I'm sure she won't be very long .
__label__noemo	What's wrong , Lisa ? You keep pacing back and forth .
__label__noemo	How many best friends do you have ?
__label__noemo	Yes . You are right .
__label__noemo	It was spring , but the weather was awful . It rained all the time .
__label__noemo	that was the last game before the playoffs .
__label__noemo	I haven't received my credit card bill yet .
__label__noemo	Let's cross here .
__label__noemo	I'm not sure but there seems to be something wrong with it . Is it still under guarantee ?
__label__noemo	For starters , we should start doing more outdoor activities . That way we'll get some exercise .
__label__noemo	I'm very sorry , sir . Will you please hold while I transfer you to my supervisor ?
__label__noemo	Today's interview is for us to get to know a little about you . If needed , there will be a more lengthy interview later . So , if you ’ re comfortable , let's begin .
__label__noemo	I went to Yale University .
__label__joy	The concert was really great .
__label__noemo	How many days is the tour ?
__label__noemo	Please hold on a minute , offer your call to Mr Richton .
__label__noemo	Hi , waiting for the bus ? Where are you going ?
__label__noemo	About a month .
__label__joy	I only go skiing twice a year , so it's a real treat for me .
__label__noemo	China Hotel .
__label__noemo	Tell me what the street signs say .
__label__noemo	No , I didn't , because it was pretty hard .
__label__noemo	You can make as many copies as you want .
__label__joy	Yes , I did . I passed !
__label__noemo	I bought a sewing machine . I know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems .
__label__noemo	Alright , alright . How did you cut this so bad ?
__label__noemo	I feel sorry for you . It's a jungle out there .
__label__sadness	I had a skydiving accident over the weekend and won ’ t be able to come to school today .
__label__noemo	Your T-zone gets oily easily , but your cheeks are dry in winter . Am I right ?
__label__noemo	I agree , but I would find it difficult to stop using my car . It's just so convenient .
__label__joy	Certainly . Come back soon .
__label__noemo	Yes , but I prefer red wine with meat .
__label__noemo	Can I come round to see him tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	Where would you like to be in 5 years ?
__label__noemo	Rice , egg , beef and vegetables .
__label__noemo	And it gives you money ?
__label__noemo	How do you prefer this one ? It cleans thoroughly without striping your natural protective oil . The gentle formula keeps skin soft and healthy .
__label__sadness	This is a pity !
__label__noemo	In two weeks .
__label__noemo	which one has the most interesting course ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry , but I don't think this damage is our fault .
__label__noemo	why ?
__label__noemo	I want to say goodbye . I ’ m leaving for America tomorrow .
__label__noemo	I'm very sorry , Mr . Bob . There has been a mistake . We'll correct the bill .
__label__noemo	Thank you so much .
__label__noemo	Excuse me !
__label__noemo	They look simple today . But they were milestones in their times .
__label__noemo	I've tried diets before but they've never worked .
__label__noemo	They are very nice , you know .
__label__noemo	Keep working hard , and then you will get another chance of promotion someday .
__label__noemo	Our selection of stereo systems with turntables is somewhat limited , but we do have this system over here .
__label__noemo	For a week or so .
__label__noemo	Choose what you want and push the button . Sometimes it takes a couple of tries .
__label__noemo	That's the most important thing .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t know how to use it .
__label__noemo	Are you going anywhere for your vacation ?
__label__noemo	Is there anything you would like to do next time ?
__label__noemo	I can do the work of shop assistant and I worked part time in a small department store during my summer vocation last year .
__label__noemo	Uh , I can see a red double decker bus . It's the kind of bus you'll see very often in London . In fact I know this bus is from London because I can see the names , Chelsea , Sloan Square , Victoria , Herring Cross . These are all areas in London . Um , so obviously the bus is in London .
__label__noemo	Right.What are you doing over there ?
__label__joy	Thanks , Professor . See you later !
__label__noemo	No , I don't think so .
__label__joy	That ’ s very kind of you , but it ’ s nothing special .
__label__noemo	I do a forty-hour week . I ’ m on flexi-time . I usually start work at 8 a . m . and finish at 4
__label__noemo	What do you want me to do about it ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I think you ’ re right . I ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet .
__label__noemo	From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg .
__label__joy	Thank you very much for your kindness .
__label__noemo	Here ’ s an interesting ad , For rent . Two-bedroom , unfurnished house , fenced yard , one-car garage . Pets OK .
__label__noemo	I am sorry , I didn ’ t catch what you said . Could you repeat it please ?
__label__noemo	How long will we dock ?
__label__noemo	Why are you always so mean ?
__label__noemo	Fine , how are you doing ?
__label__noemo	I'll tell you what , if your pet can fit in this little box and doesn't have fur , it is welcome here .
__label__noemo	Is there a swimming pool in this hotel ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me , is this personnel division ?
__label__noemo	The form has a map on the back . You may specify your top four choices.We will give a spot in the lot that has an opening .
__label__noemo	Ok , let's hurry .
__label__noemo	I'll get my things and meet you there .
__label__noemo	Birds of feather flock together .
__label__joy	Cool , thanks .
__label__noemo	How much is a round-trip ticket to London ?
__label__noemo	The pipe is behind a wall in my bathroom .
__label__noemo	What are the best foods to eat ?
__label__noemo	I don't want to have a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing .
__label__noemo	No . I have only personal effects .
__label__noemo	Hi , Bob . I heard that you had passed your driving test . Is it true ?
__label__noemo	I've got the correct change already .
__label__noemo	I would really appreciate it if we could talk for a few minutes now . It ’ s about the overtime you ’ Ve asked me to put in .
__label__noemo	Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
__label__joy	It doesn't matter .
__label__noemo	Can I do anything else for you today ?
__label__noemo	I wear size 40 .
__label__noemo	Today Mr . Leo threw Sally out of class !
__label__noemo	Yes . The beer is brewed by using carefully selected malts , rice , hops and natural water from the Lao Mountain .
__label__noemo	Sort of . I prepared a list of all the people who can vouch for my experience and good work ethic .
__label__noemo	I will feel it is a pity . But I will not feel so bad . I will go for other interviews until I am employed satisfactorily . Hopefully before I find another position , you will call me back .
__label__noemo	Well , I guess people who lived here before didn't clean the bathtub .
__label__joy	The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ?
__label__noemo	It's not a surprise , is it ? She has always been a hard working student .
__label__noemo	With the tax , your total is $ 32.42 . Would you like to charge it ?
__label__noemo	Maybe later . I think we have a medicine-kit .
__label__noemo	I want a big pan .
__label__joy	Do you like climbing ?
__label__noemo	Yes , but I need to borrow some more money .
__label__joy	Good . I'll get three pounds of it .
__label__noemo	What do you think now ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m thinking about buying this sweater . I know it ’ s june now , but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
__label__noemo	It's so crowded . All the seats are taken . Let's go there . There is a seat over there .
__label__noemo	If you totally agree , I'll type the agreement this evening and have it duplicated for signatures .
__label__noemo	well , we ’ Ve had to add that to the contract because we found that many of our employees were taking almost one sick day a month , even though they weren ’ t sick .
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__noemo	everything's great . I've just returned from my office .
__label__joy	God it . Thans very much .
__label__noemo	What kind of meat would you like to get today ?
__label__noemo	yeah , I crave my own space . i just so tired of having people around me all time .
__label__noemo	Very good . Any questions ?
__label__noemo	Don ’ t do that again . You are riding the tiger .
__label__noemo	We must keep developing our economy and unite with other developing countries to fight against it .
__label__joy	Okay . Bye .
__label__noemo	OK . When should we be there ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it's a family tradition dating back to my childhood . We use the same lights and ornaments , but of course we have a new tree each year.The children made some of these decorations . Here , you can hang this on one of those high branches .
__label__noemo	No , not really . When I left Vietnam , I came to America and I lived with a cousin in Dallas for two years . Where do you work , Alice ?
__label__noemo	This is Mr Brown speaking . I'd like to speak to Mr . Thomas , please .
__label__noemo	Then I can buy my own car .
__label__joy	Certainly.It matches your suit perfectly .
__label__noemo	Just tell me what you'd like , please .
__label__noemo	Yes , he will .
__label__noemo	For example ?
__label__noemo	Let me get a bag of chips too .
__label__noemo	I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the school clinic ? I've lost my way .
__label__noemo	Of course . Is the dinner still on ?
__label__joy	Thank you , doctor . Bye .
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	I have some problem with my work .
__label__noemo	Not for a couple of years . What happened to her ?
__label__noemo	Kobe Bryant , of course .
__label__noemo	I don't know when I can come . I'll let you know later .
__label__noemo	Yes . I am capable of speaking English smoothly . I have been learning English for years .
__label__noemo	Next class meeting .
__label__noemo	Eight .
__label__surprise	Aren't you crazy ?
__label__noemo	Not quite , if we get too heavily in debt , the shares will tend to drop .
__label__joy	Well , birds of a feather flock together . I like her too . She was in a lot of dramas .
__label__noemo	We hit a couple of local bars , and met up with some friends . Everything was cool until Mike came along , and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday !
__label__noemo	Well , this might be silly . But I just can't get him off my mind . And I can't help missing him .
__label__noemo	Do you want any milk ?
__label__noemo	Room service.What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	I understand . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Sounds Like I'm missing out on a good time . Oh , well , there is always next year .
__label__noemo	My pleasure ! How much would you like to spend on your date ?
__label__noemo	Is your father in the habit of having naps ?
__label__joy	That's quite a compliment coming from you .
__label__noemo	What day is today ? Tuesday ?
__label__noemo	Not always , she's rather busy at the end of the year .
__label__noemo	Let me get the keys and we ’ ll go to look at it .
__label__noemo	Sure . It's down this street on the left .
__label__noemo	Hello ? This is Mike here . May I have a word with Grace ?
__label__noemo	No . Um , do you carry any padded coat ?
__label__joy	that would be wonderful . Thanks !
__label__noemo	What time does the train for Tibet leave ?
__label__noemo	Are you sure ? How do you know ?
__label__noemo	Hello ! Are you shopping here today ? Haven't I seen you in some flea markets and thrift shops a couple of times ?
__label__noemo	I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .
__label__noemo	Will this table be all right ?
__label__noemo	I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes .
__label__noemo	Don't you have a credit card ?
__label__joy	Oh look ! What a great little bib for the baby ! This will definitely come in handy ! Oh wow , you also got me a stroller ! That ’ s so great ! Thank you !
__label__noemo	What ’ s wrong with you , Ted ?
__label__joy	She's doing great , she's getting her confidence back , and her self-esteem , has improved drastically.She ' s very happy .
__label__noemo	No , that won ’ t do . I ’ ll take this smoked ham you have here .
__label__noemo	I would like to make an appointment to discuss the problems I keep having with my apartment .
__label__noemo	I fixed a big problem with a machine and saved a lot of money for the factory . I got bonus for it .
__label__joy	Thank you . I won ’ t miss it .
__label__noemo	Good coming .
__label__noemo	"This is an especially famous one . It says "" May the passing days bring you health and longevity . May this season of renewal find you basked in riches . """
__label__noemo	He brings with him some talented people from his former city .
__label__noemo	Sorry , not yet ! can you help me to select the dress ? i don , t what i should wear to fit thinner party .
__label__noemo	I need a snack from the cafeteria .
__label__noemo	Take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch .
__label__noemo	Management is going through a big turnover these days . With Bill's retirement , and department realignment , we have lost about 1/3 of our managerial staff . They've been dropping like flies ...
__label__joy	Thank you . Have a nice day .
__label__noemo	No . We ’ ll meet at my house . He invited my family to spend the weekend with his family at their villa .
__label__noemo	The people don ’ t really work out there . They just stand around and talk all the time .
__label__noemo	Could I trouble you for a minute , Mr . Graham ?
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome .
__label__noemo	That's right.Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony .
__label__noemo	Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ?
__label__noemo	Look , the printer isn ’ t functioning well . I ’ Ve pushed the start button . It is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log . What ’ s going on ?
__label__noemo	Wow ! What about the memory ?
__label__noemo	So , it is the 27th Teachers ' Day .
__label__noemo	No , we will have lunch at the museum cafeteria .
__label__noemo	Give me your hand . ( takes Rose's hand ) Close your eyes . Go on . ( Rose closes her eyes ) Step up . Now hold on to the rail . Keep your eyes closed ; don't peek .
__label__noemo	What's that ?
__label__noemo	Jim Chan . The account's in my name . Is that all you need to know ?
__label__noemo	Your room number is 707 . Here is your key . The bellhop will help you carry the suitcases to your room . Have a nice evening !
__label__joy	OK darling , I got some pizzas , potato chips , hot dogs and lots of cheese !
__label__noemo	Can you please give me a hand ? I can ’ t carry the heavy box .
__label__noemo	Not a problem . We'll call you tomorrow morning at 7 , and again at 7 fifteen .
__label__noemo	It's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . Then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she need to cancel the trip . I was so angry when she told me that I said she didn't care about our friendship at all .
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome .
__label__joy	I ’ m glad to know that you think the apartment is so nice .
__label__noemo	What should I do then ?
__label__noemo	Yes , could you show me to your coat section ?
__label__noemo	Why do you look so sad ?
__label__surprise	Dad ! Are you serious ? What ’ s the point of having central heating if we can ’ t use it ! Look , I can see my breath !
__label__noemo	I have one but it can only be used in my country .
__label__noemo	Is this taxi taken ?
__label__joy	We haven't decided yet . There are a lot of things to sort out , you know .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Are you under a lot of stress ?
__label__noemo	Mmmm ... a photo I . D . I have my New Jersey driver ’ s license . Is that ok ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me , sir . I am coming to apply for the position of accountant .
__label__noemo	Alright .
__label__noemo	He was hoping that you could drop them off this afternoon .
__label__noemo	Yes , here you are .
__label__noemo	Of course there is . Things can be divided and broken down into indefinitely small parts if we can .
__label__noemo	It ’ s not easy , particularly with listening and speaking , because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good .
__label__noemo	It's the 11th Avenue , Park Street .
__label__noemo	Which room are you in ?
__label__noemo	I really want to go to China for vacation , but I can ’ t find a cheap plane ticket .
__label__noemo	Your BAC exceeds legal limit .
__label__noemo	Yes , some friends play it all day , all night , and sometimes a whole weekend . I tried to read about some basic rules online , but it is hard to understand . So I went to watch people play yesterday only to find I was even more confused . I think I have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . Practice makes the master .
__label__noemo	just one more thing . A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend and I don't know what to do .
__label__noemo	Please sign the back of the check .
__label__noemo	Good morning ! May I help you ?
__label__noemo	It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
__label__noemo	Oh great ! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to !
__label__joy	Oh baby , I ’ m so sorry .
__label__joy	Thank you , Rick ! As you can see , ladies and gentleman , we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars !
__label__noemo	I'm afraid we don't have any . If I were you , I'd try one of the newspaper stands .
__label__noemo	Can you tell me how many credits would be enough for a Bachelor's degree ?
__label__noemo	The weatherman predicts a fine day today .
__label__noemo	I like to listen to Rock and R & B .
__label__noemo	The lab and the computers are no charge , but you have to pay for whatever you print .
__label__noemo	Could I have look at that pair of canvas shoes ? They look nice .
__label__noemo	I have exactly the same feeling . This afternoon he explained the ins and outs of the stock market to me . He knows a lot about investments .
__label__noemo	I didn't expect to see you at this hour . You must have goofed off again .
__label__noemo	Well , it ’ s not like that . We just e-mail , it ’ s really nothing . On top of which I am definitely thinking about stopping because it ’ s getting ...
__label__joy	Let ’ s dine out tonight for a change !
__label__noemo	Yeah . Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian . She's almost driving Li Na crazy .
__label__noemo	Come on , just a bite . It doesn't really hurt to have just a bite .
__label__noemo	Honey , I am sorry that I am too busy most of the time .
__label__noemo	I didn ’ t pay attention to that .
__label__noemo	It gives you money ?
__label__noemo	Hmm ... does he have a good ear for hip hop music ?
__label__noemo	No , but I wouldn't be surprised if it rained tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Well , I don't think much about it . To me , it's a sheer waste of time
__label__noemo	A return ticket is forty-six pounds fifty .
__label__noemo	We need a new filing cabinet in the office . Could you go downtown with me after lunch ?
__label__noemo	No way to know .
__label__noemo	You are not really chubby . You are actually thin enough .
__label__noemo	I know that he will .
__label__noemo	Would you stay for another cup of coffee ?
__label__joy	that was a really good meal , Gordon .
__label__noemo	She looked a little rough around the edges but had great skills .
__label__noemo	Sir , our room prices are slightly higher than you may have thought . Will that be okay ?
__label__noemo	Is it worth seeing ?
__label__noemo	You need to give me your ID and $ 27 .
__label__noemo	First I want to look in the travel guide.Maybe they don't have tours in the morning .
__label__noemo	Yep . They're prescription contacts with UV protection .
__label__noemo	Well , I am thinking about redesigning my kitchen .
__label__joy	Thanks very much .
__label__noemo	Which school are you studying at ?
__label__noemo	Come upstairs .
__label__noemo	Thanks .
__label__surprise	Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ?
__label__noemo	What does a housing go for in south mountain district ?
__label__noemo	Driving during the rush hours can be a bit of a bind .
__label__noemo	No .
__label__joy	That ’ s right . They tastes so good ! We eat them with mint sauce . Have you every tried them ?
__label__noemo	Yes , but don't cut them yet . Wait until they cool . Where is the big plastic bowl ?
__label__noemo	Are you Miss Thou Ping ?
__label__noemo	Most jobs provide unemployment , but some don ’ t .
__label__noemo	First , I ’ Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story .
__label__noemo	Excellent . I see you have the 18th century poetry class for next semester.And the modern novel class . You haven't taken a Shakespeare class yet .
__label__noemo	I ’ m glad to have the opportunity of visiting your corporation . I hope to conclude some substantial business with you .
__label__noemo	Any rain ?
__label__noemo	One week after I have submitted my resignation paper .
__label__noemo	So you have to open all the envelopes .
__label__anger	They released me the next morning .
__label__noemo	And your telephone number ?
__label__noemo	Just plain water with plenty of ice rock .
__label__joy	That's correct . Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	All right . I will take a room for a week . Here is my passport .
__label__noemo	It's Traveller's Cheques , is that possible ?
__label__surprise	Really ? I am glad to meet you .
__label__noemo	Yes , it's far quicker and less complicated .
__label__noemo	Yes , maybe they are short-handed in the kitchen tonight .
__label__noemo	Why wouldn't I want to know ?
__label__noemo	Thanks .
__label__noemo	What did you watch today ?
__label__noemo	I have a good idea to solve it . The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes .
__label__noemo	why did you say so ?
__label__noemo	Well , since it's rush hour , I'd say the ride would take about thirty minutes , more or less.Is that okay ?
__label__noemo	Me too . It always smells so fresh after it rains .
__label__noemo	I try very hard . The problem is , my salary just isn't enough to live on . Now that I have a wife and a child to support , we hardly have enough money for food and rent .
__label__noemo	well , if you want we can go together sometime . Actually I was thinking of going this afternoon , if you like , you can join me and I can show you the neighborhood along the way .
__label__disgust	I just can't stand it . It's really gross in here ! There ' s a stain on the toilet seat , and the floor was wet and slippery . So I cleaned it !
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__noemo	May I try on this pair of shoes ?
__label__noemo	It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth .
__label__joy	I'm glad that we've settled the price .
__label__joy	Hi , Tina , I ’ Ve got good news . I have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with ABC Company . They informed me to go to the final round next Monday . It looks very promising .
__label__noemo	Fine , thank you , and how are you ?
__label__noemo	All right , see you later .
__label__noemo	The coast of your country is very varied . The coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
__label__noemo	Fine , but I ’ m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me .
__label__surprise	You didn't have to do that !
__label__noemo	I voted for Obama .
__label__noemo	If they steal the entire package , that would be theft . So they don't do that . Generally , thieves open the case and take part of the contents out . Then fill the case so that the gross weight will be the same .
__label__noemo	What do you mean ? These are the washing machines . Those big things over there are the dryers .
__label__noemo	I ’ m not kidding . Learning a language is a question of forming language habits and that takes time .
__label__noemo	Sure . Thank you . It seems your business is prosperous . There are many customers here .
__label__joy	The seats in the middle of this stadium are great , but they're already occupied by somebody else .
__label__noemo	We'd better have a brief talk about the loading port .
__label__noemo	What have you done ?
__label__noemo	Well thank you ! In that case , I am 26 years old , and what about yourself ?
__label__noemo	Tomorrow will be my first day at work , what do you think I should be wearing ?
__label__noemo	Hmm , you're right .
__label__noemo	From Canada ? Where were you born ?
__label__noemo	Sure you have to be patient . But I think it ’ s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls .
__label__joy	No.That ' s all .
__label__noemo	Yes , that's right .
__label__joy	Hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world .
__label__noemo	I would like to fight my ticket .
__label__noemo	OK , I'll buy two pairs of each color.And do you have sports socks ?
__label__noemo	Well , you have three kids , so you knew what it meant once upon a time !
__label__noemo	Yes , I know that . It's why Ive been trying to become one of those suppliers . I hear you're a good man to do business with .
__label__joy	Yeah , but I wish they delivered video games too . Then I would never leave my house !
__label__noemo	Bye , Ann !
__label__noemo	Our harassment policy requires that we have a meeting with the HR manager and Miss Brown . It's quite serious . You could be reprimanded , or even fired if we find evidence that you were pressuring
__label__noemo	Hello . I'm having a problem with my air conditioner .
__label__noemo	Then I'll put it on my Master Card . Here you are .
__label__noemo	How much is the rent for the apartment ?
__label__noemo	That same morning I have some business to take care of .
__label__noemo	I know them .
__label__disgust	He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out , referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling . I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment .
__label__noemo	It's a good thing you can speak English !
__label__noemo	Would you like anything to drink with that ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I'm looking for a cap.Size 16 .
__label__noemo	Ok , I understand . But why you choose us to work for ?
__label__noemo	I'm a little short . I don't have enough for you .
__label__noemo	When will we begin ?
__label__noemo	Yes , what's your name ?
__label__noemo	I am so glad they called you . It feels like something is really wrong with my stomach !
__label__noemo	Do you have anything to declare ?
__label__noemo	Oh , that ’ s very kind of you . I am going to the Garden Hotel .
__label__noemo	But this is terrible . I'm expecting important calls .
__label__noemo	Look at the view from the window .
__label__noemo	Yes , right , certainly . Here you go .
__label__noemo	A good rest is all you need , and drink more water . I'll write you a prescription .
__label__joy	I'll always remember my college days .
__label__noemo	I stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
__label__noemo	Six weeks , did you say ?
__label__noemo	May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Try to be more careful in future .
__label__noemo	Would you need it for both Saturday and Sunday ?
__label__noemo	The bonus season is coming . How much of a bonus can I expect ?
__label__noemo	All right . Hop in , please .
__label__noemo	Alright , tell me about the ties you have to your home country .
__label__joy	Sure . I love this place , especially the decoration . So tasteful !
__label__noemo	I think its critical advantage lies in its low cost . All you need is a racket , a table and a light celluloid ball . Tables are usually available in public recreation areas , like finest rooms , and outdoor playgrounds ...
__label__noemo	I need 30 for my Christmas cards .
__label__noemo	I just got off the phone with my boyfriend . He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing . It ’ s so hard to talk to him at times .
__label__noemo	What day will you need it for ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , Judy . I will be working for the Post Office . It ’ s not a bad job .
__label__joy	It's super .
__label__noemo	I have apple pie , ice cream , chocolate cake and fruit cocktail .
__label__noemo	Nice to meet You , Ms . Thou . We've learned that you specialize in the export of electronic products .
__label__noemo	Coffee would be fine .
__label__noemo	Okay ... what makes you say that ? I thought you were pleased with his overall performance . Didn ’ t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude ?
__label__noemo	We will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily . And if you come back to office , you just reconnect your laptop with docking station .
__label__noemo	Are we going to come back here for lunch ?
__label__noemo	All right.Now that everybody's here . Shall we be getting started ? Miss Lin , are you ready ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it's used , but she said it was in very good shape . It's a small foreign car .
__label__noemo	I'm so sorry . We ran out of filet mignon . May I suggest the porterhouse instead ?
__label__noemo	Yes . Of course . But what good will it do ? That man's miles away from here by now . In our car .
__label__joy	Smells good ! I ’ ll make some coffee . Do you want me to make you some eggs ?
__label__noemo	I guess not , huh .
__label__noemo	Thank you . And when is the latest time for me to board the plane ?
__label__noemo	I can hardly make ends meet these days .
__label__noemo	Just since today .
__label__surprise	why ? What happened ?
__label__joy	I will never forget this match . The angle is so terrible and so correct .
__label__noemo	I ’ m afraid I can ’ t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ Ve received from other sources .
__label__noemo	There's a bag in the bathroom . Just put your laundry in it .
__label__noemo	What type do you have in your mind ?
__label__noemo	Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products .
__label__noemo	I don't know . A friend of mine said I should try it .
__label__noemo	It wasn't always like this , you know .
__label__noemo	Yes , I wanna go to America for my vacation .
__label__noemo	The small one , just down the street . I like their generic brand .
__label__joy	There ’ s an interesting feature article in the chronicle about doing business in china and the daily news has printed a report about the special economic zone near pairs . We have a subsidiary company l
__label__noemo	I might get one too , but in a different colour . I prefer light blue to while .
__label__noemo	It should be handwashed with cold water . It's a common sense . Don't you know it ?
__label__noemo	Here is my money .
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brain power .
__label__noemo	I see you have a coffee bar for a water cooler . The staff here must be comfortable . I think it really helps morale when people feel supported by their employers .
__label__noemo	That ’ s a good idea . I haven ’ t been in a while and I need to get a new backpack . The old one is hanging on by a thread !
__label__joy	I'd like to make a deposit please , into my granddaughter's account . It's her birthday on Friday .
__label__noemo	Well , I want to be transferred to the Shanghai office .
__label__noemo	the second one sounds rather difficult to answer . What did you tell her ?
__label__noemo	Absolutely .
__label__noemo	I've never seen you so worked up . what did she do to you ?
__label__noemo	The machines take change ?
__label__noemo	You might want to try the mangoes .
__label__noemo	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	Sure , it's easy . First of all , the secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple . People are listening and they usually don't have a long attention spans . Stick to about three or four points , give an overview of the points , then present them one by one , and then summarize at the end . Be straightforward and organized and you're sure to be remembered .
__label__noemo	Okay . But what is a tailgate party ?
__label__noemo	I am a fireman and it is a dangerous job . I have to consider your mother's life .
__label__noemo	Is it a four-door or a two-door ?
__label__noemo	Is there anything else ?
__label__noemo	Don ’ t worry . There ’ s plenty of time yet .
__label__noemo	Yeah . She died in her sleep .
__label__noemo	Yes , I ’ m the manager here . What can I do for you , Madam ?
__label__noemo	You ’ ll only have to pay the initial fee .
__label__joy	So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea !
__label__surprise	Good Lord ! Look at that man .
__label__noemo	Um , sure . What are we having for dinner ? Do I need to put out anything in particular ?
__label__noemo	Well , if I were you , I'd go on studying .
__label__noemo	How much will our order from your factory be ?
__label__noemo	That happened to my oldest girl . She became really upset when her classmates told her Santa wasn ’ t real .
__label__noemo	Pete's Pizza , may I help you ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , I just got them . I started playing ice hockey in a community league . So , I finally got myself new skates .

__label__noemo	Good , morning ! Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Maybe , there was a subway accident .
__label__noemo	Yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe .
__label__noemo	What's your favourite steps ?
__label__noemo	May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Sure . Your room number , PLS ?
__label__noemo	I could do that .
__label__joy	Thank you . I try to keep in shape .
__label__noemo	Thanks doc !
__label__noemo	Oh , I am sorry to hear that . Take it easy . It will be OK soon . You see , I take this long-hour plane frequently , but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
__label__noemo	The same to you , Joey .
__label__noemo	What about cab drivers and porters ?
__label__noemo	Are you being served , sir ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , it'll take us there .
__label__noemo	To the office . I'll be right back .
__label__noemo	It's been a long time , hasn't it ? How are you ?
__label__noemo	My name is James .
__label__noemo	I am sorry , it ’ s not decided by me but by the company .
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__noemo	There is one just around the corner .
__label__noemo	Okay . ( Reads the lease ) So , according to the lease , I ’ ll deposit one month ’ s rent as a security deposit , and I have to pay the first month ’ s rent in advance . I understand that I ’ ll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs .
__label__noemo	Whatever things get tough , he gives in .
__label__noemo	What is the rate ?
__label__noemo	Dear , can you drive me to the clinic ?
__label__joy	Great ! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . Good , good . This week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . Now let ’ s take a look at this tricky section .
__label__noemo	oh , maybe I can take the bus or even rent a car .
__label__noemo	How long will you stay with the host family ?
__label__noemo	Why are you climbing through the window and not leaving by the front door ?
__label__joy	Oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ?
__label__noemo	I think we're finished . Can you please turn off the lights and shut the door ?
__label__noemo	Sorry . I didn't quite catch what you said . There's a lot of noise outside .
__label__noemo	Oh , I am very sorry , Hans . Thank you for waiting for me . You must have been here a long time already .
__label__noemo	The movie type is drama .
__label__noemo	Mr CK Chen contacted me this morning and asked me to come in for the remittance .
__label__noemo	Yes , it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
__label__joy	Very comfortable . I think I will come next time . Maybe I will take some friends . Amazing !
__label__noemo	Yes.Do you have football stockings here ?
__label__noemo	"I was taking a walk in the park early this morning when suddenly I heard someone calling "" help "" . I rushed over and saw a man beating a woman ."
__label__surprise	You're kidding !
__label__noemo	And what should I wear ?
__label__noemo	Sure . That would be great .
__label__noemo	There are about twenty people named Chang who work here . What department ?
__label__noemo	Hi . My name's David Johnson . I'd like to make an appointment .
__label__noemo	Which language do you speak ?
__label__noemo	Have you got your visa yet ?
__label__noemo	I don ' t think so . I don't think people are going to like it if they have to pay to come . But we certainly can cut costs in other ways , such as make the party BYOB .
__label__noemo	Okay . Do you have a particular size in mind ?
__label__noemo	That was very thoughtful of you to volunteer me .
__label__joy	That's good . Could you wrap it for me ?
__label__noemo	Hello , Pauline ’ s Furniture Store , Faye speaking . How may I help you ?
__label__noemo	Yes . We have socks made of various materials . These socks are of imported wool .
__label__noemo	Yes , you are paying for it , so you get to choose . I would pick the best one .
__label__noemo	Six are compulsory , two optional .
__label__noemo	Yes , our delivery fee could be waived , if you make an order of 50 units or more . We would have to insist on the annual contract , however . I understand it's not the most convenient for you . Perhaps we could shorten it to a sixth month contract if you are willing to take a lower rebate .
__label__noemo	Good evening . Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	What are you shopping for ?
__label__noemo	Good morning .
__label__noemo	I don't care about baseball.You know I need to practice for the chess championship and you promised to help with me if I washed the dishes for you last Sunday , and I did .
__label__noemo	Of course not . What exactly would you like to know ?
__label__noemo	Hey Susan , what are you coming as this year ?
__label__noemo	I know what you mean . I fit into my clothes , but I'm not always comfortable .
__label__noemo	What does it cost to ride this bus ?
__label__noemo	Of course . Let me tell you in some detail about our idea.You know the popular Hello Kitty products .
__label__noemo	On the contrary , I think he's very serious .
__label__joy	good idea . that ' s why i think i have culture . you have any other suggestions ?
__label__noemo	do you like music ?
__label__noemo	That of the old man .
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__noemo	Come on . I don't see any point in arguing about this . Everyone has a right to his own opinion .
__label__noemo	What ? Won't you have more drinks ?
__label__joy	Okay , I'll pick you up at eight o'clock .
__label__noemo	I kind of wanted to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ”
__label__noemo	I am in charge of the trading department . I'm handling invoices , shipping bills and computing freight costs , that's most of the documentation .
__label__noemo	They're just gifts I bought . Don't worry . They are not heavy .
__label__noemo	Certainly . Which flight would you like ?
__label__noemo	yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day .
__label__surprise	""" Tie a Yellow Ribbon on the Old Oak Tree "" ? ! Where did you learn that song ?"
__label__noemo	I know . I have to prepare the supper for the whole family before I leave .
__label__noemo	Never mind .
__label__joy	Yes . We're satisfied with the result .
__label__joy	Wonderful . Thanks very much .
__label__noemo	This is my uncle , Charles .
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Is this the Friendship Hospital ? Please send an ambulance to 68 Hu Nan Road .
__label__joy	You're welcome !
__label__noemo	Hello , Mrs Turnbull . How are you ?
__label__noemo	I think something must be done .
__label__noemo	Hi , Betty ! Where's your boyfriend ?
__label__noemo	The keys will be turned in on Tuesday night . The house will be yours at that time .
__label__noemo	I did , too.Come and visit us again , will you ?
__label__noemo	Is this your best score ?
__label__noemo	I see .
__label__noemo	Hi , Doris . You look a little bit down . What's the matter ?
__label__noemo	I'm afraid it's too late . We are downsizing our workforce and you'll have to go .
__label__noemo	The mirror is behind you , sir .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'd like to give it a try .
__label__noemo	Be careful of the peeler . Don't cut your fingers .
__label__noemo	Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do .
__label__noemo	I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that . I don ’ t think we should use an agency , because they won ’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ . Have we decide on the location of the branch office ?
__label__noemo	It's not a simple thing to be beautiful .
__label__noemo	What's the problem ?
__label__noemo	We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike .
__label__noemo	I need to buy some new clothes for the summer too . Perhaps we can go together one day .
__label__noemo	Yes . Would you like a window seat ?
__label__noemo	Hello , I'd like to speak to Mike please .
__label__noemo	Do you drink green tea , then ?
__label__noemo	The next beginning class starts on October 25th .
__label__noemo	I'm going to Ireland this summer .
__label__noemo	The public schools in the United States are free to everyone and there is no cost to the student . In most states , even the textbooks are free . There are no restrictions as to color , race , or religion.Any student wishing to attend the public schools may do so .
__label__noemo	Perhaps you left that at school .
__label__noemo	Do you need a ticket ?
__label__noemo	Well , it came with a certificate , and it looks real . But auctioning on eBay is risky .
__label__noemo	Just fine , Karen . I ’ m just taking a breather from all this paper work !
__label__noemo	Yes , most of the shops are closed at 22:00 or even earlier , but the internet operates 24 hours a day , seven days a week , and can be accessed anywhere .
__label__noemo	What course did you like best ?
__label__noemo	I got the information that there is a killer sale at the shopping mall near our block . Get up and I will wait for you at the gate of our flat .
__label__noemo	He looks tired all the time .
__label__noemo	I would love to see it .
__label__noemo	Why do they go there ?
__label__noemo	that would be a good shot . Can you take my picture here , dear ? Please try to get the garden in the frame as well .
__label__joy	Good . Fortune is usually ahead of the curve.And Business Week is very solid , too .
__label__noemo	Yes , I need to order a large number of Webster's dictionaries .
__label__noemo	No . 10 % is my last word .
__label__joy	Oh look ! What a great little bib for the baby ! This will definitely come in handy ! Oh wow , you also got me a stroller ! That ’ s so great ! Thank you !
__label__joy	I think there ’ s a very romantic new film starring Hugh Grant . Let ’ s go and see that .
__label__noemo	Yeah .
__label__sadness	Thank you for waiting.It takes another ten to fifteen minutes , I'm afraid .
__label__noemo	I have experience in computer operation , proficiency in Microsoft Windows , Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel .
__label__joy	My friend Jean is very beautiful .
__label__noemo	It ’ s easy grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . Ok . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers .
__label__noemo	What's the weather like there today ?
__label__noemo	I need to think it over .
__label__noemo	Yes , she is . And guess what , he is her sixth husband .
__label__noemo	It should apply to all communications , not only in this office between employees , but also any outside communications .
__label__disgust	Gross !
__label__joy	That ’ s good news . The good thing is that most people treat their pets well .
__label__noemo	Yes , he stole a plane in Canada and flew into the U . S .
__label__noemo	Why , this is the most interesting film !
__label__joy	Hi Martha . Everything is perfect .
__label__noemo	Did you get a chance to speak with the sellers about my counter-offer ?
__label__noemo	Won't you let me buy a new one tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	I can't believe how hot it is .
__label__noemo	How about sick days ?
__label__noemo	We do not want you to sign any documents that you do not understand . You may get assistance with any questions that you have .
__label__noemo	Oh , I don ’ t know where we ’ re going yet .
__label__noemo	What are you going to do now ?
__label__sadness	I'm sorry to have bothered you .
__label__noemo	Ah , yes . I remember now . Were you Mr . John ’ s dinner partner last month ?
__label__noemo	It depends on the topic , the teacher , and the way the course is set up . Yesterday , even though we only had a short time to discuss the issues , the workshop got us all thinking . We learned some very basic , but very useful methods of dealing with personnel issues .
__label__joy	I ’ Ve seen it so many times in books , but I never imagined I ’ d get to see it in person .
__label__noemo	How do you get through the stuffy daytime ?
__label__noemo	What's your nationality ?
__label__noemo	Well , let me check for you . I am sorry , sir . They mistook your order as a normal one.Actualty it's an express laundry , is that right ?
__label__noemo	Not at all . The feedback from audience has been great . I care about what they think more than what the critics think .
__label__noemo	It depends .
__label__noemo	Just a hunch , sir .
__label__noemo	Eleven , ...
__label__noemo	I think the gears have seized up
__label__noemo	Does he like that country ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I am kidding.But don't you know only professors and students with disabilitiescan apply for parking permits ?
__label__noemo	Do you think that's a good spot ?
__label__noemo	I'm ready now . I'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn .
__label__noemo	You like to communicate with him ?
__label__noemo	I understand . It's good you came to the emergency room .
__label__noemo	One dollar to five francs . Is that all right ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s about an hour ’ s drive .
__label__noemo	Then , how about this ?
__label__noemo	Hi , Susan !
__label__noemo	I'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on Monday .
__label__noemo	Which Channel is it ?
__label__noemo	Allow me to give you a hand .
__label__noemo	All right , then . Why don't we say next Tuesday at 11:30 a . m . ?
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__joy	For the first drive , put the golf ball on the tee , and push the tee into the ground .
__label__noemo	Mine aren't so good , either .
__label__noemo	Kitty's ? He sure gets around , doesn't he ?
__label__noemo	Hey Stacy . What's going on ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it seems to have been discounted from two hundred and thirty-five thousand to two hundred and twenty-five thousand
__label__noemo	It's much too hard for his age .
__label__noemo	Employees will also have housing payment reserve funds .
__label__noemo	Never mind , come right in . I've almost finished.You always keep the room neat and tidy , I must say.It saves me a lot of work , but you should let me do it .
__label__noemo	Oh , I won't be back so early . The film will be over at nine . Can I have the key to the bicycle ?
__label__noemo	Not yet . I have an interview with the visa official today .
__label__surprise	Addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way !
__label__noemo	No , are there any vacant beds for us ?
__label__noemo	My mother is a professor and my father is a manager .
__label__noemo	Right . Is there anything else that can be done there ?
__label__joy	You're welcome , sir .
__label__noemo	I kind of want a soda .
__label__noemo	Yes . This is room 804 . I can't find my coat . I was wondering if it's in the lost and found .
__label__noemo	I'm absolutely certain .
__label__noemo	I am single , I have no real of , only an E-gf , that is you .
__label__noemo	Yes , it must be used for grinding coffee beans .
__label__noemo	Sort of , but I could know more , I guess .
__label__noemo	What about the balance of the order ? Can they also arrive at our company quickly ?
__label__joy	Excellent . I ’ ll see you on Thursday at 9 30 .
__label__noemo	Yes . Our price can't be matched .
__label__sadness	I just don ’ t want to play table tennis any more .
__label__noemo	I know what she would like---some whitening cream .
__label__noemo	Sure . Here it is .
__label__surprise	Oh , my goodness . I'm sorry . But I don't think tai chi is to be practiced like that .
__label__noemo	There are about 30 million people in my country . Most of them live in the north .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__noemo	Fine , here it is and have a great semester !
__label__noemo	We have some nice pants . You can also get him a belt with it .
__label__joy	got it . Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	The end of this month .
__label__joy	Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal .
__label__noemo	Come over here . I will test your eyes . First cover your left eye like this , and when I point , please read the chart from the top , and go as far as you can , telling me which way the “ E ” points .
__label__noemo	Are these things negotiable ?
__label__noemo	not yet . But I wonder if I can get my parents ’ consent .
__label__noemo	Can you see what his schedule is like on Wednesday ?
__label__joy	I know what you mean . I'm so full that I can burst . Shall we go then ?
__label__noemo	Do you know what produce is on sale ?
__label__noemo	oh , it ’ s a pity . What was the matter ?
__label__noemo	Yes , sir . What would you want to drink , coffee , tea or milk ?
__label__noemo	Good morning , madam . Can I help you ?
__label__anger	I'll beat him .
__label__noemo	And did you like it ?
__label__noemo	I would be interested in a ten-day trip around Christmas time .
__label__noemo	With pleasure .
__label__noemo	Did you download a movie or rent it at the store ?
__label__joy	Let's do both ! Are we in a rush or anything
__label__noemo	If your pet ruins the apartment walls or carpet we ’ ll keep your pet deposit . If not , we ’ ll return your deposit when you move out . But be careful , we don ’ t allow pet snakes in the apartment .
__label__noemo	You said it . Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks .
__label__joy	I've brought some potato chips . Would you like some , Jack ?
__label__noemo	I'm now a secretary in my present work unit . My work is not interesting . I have to type , make copies , book tickets and so on . Everyday I follow the routine . Furthermore , I have studied English for four years at university , but I can ’ t use it there . They are the reasons I plan to change my job .
__label__noemo	I see your problem .
__label__noemo	Me , too . I overheard someone say Taylor has a brain tumor .
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Oh , yes , it does . Look , here it says that the CD-ROM is built-in !
__label__noemo	I hear you have to wear uniforms at private school .
__label__joy	Hi , Mike , what gives ?
__label__noemo	You did ? Do tell me . I've spent all these months trying to learn something new about it , but I've made little progress !
__label__noemo	What can I do with my baggage while I visit a few more tourist spots ?
__label__noemo	Yes.With the 600 - second digital memory , l can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
__label__noemo	We have a new-fashioned cell phone especially designed for young girls . The brand name is Nokia .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t think that ’ s gonna cut it . I need something bigger and better !
__label__joy	Wow ! You're right ! This refrigerator is great . I'll take it .
__label__noemo	I am not sure . I don't know that many restaurants around here .
__label__noemo	Here you are . Would you like a cup of tea or coffee ?
__label__noemo	Oh , no . It looks like we're late .
__label__joy	You look pretty in red .
__label__noemo	Can ’ t you stay a little longer ?
__label__noemo	Ha , she is unstoppable . I'm learning so much from her .
__label__noemo	I'd like to open a savings account . What's the interest rate now ?

__label__noemo	Well , trains are frequent and come on time .
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?

__label__noemo	Hello , is that Miss Smith ?
__label__noemo	Sure , Mum.In a minute .
__label__noemo	You can just go to work after you vote .

__label__noemo	Oh , don't worry . I just killed a pigeon .
__label__joy	Great ! That'll be ahead of schedule ! Good work .
__label__noemo	He said I have a big nose . I wonder what that means .
__label__noemo	I am Looking for a T-shirt .
__label__noemo	I'm hungry . I'd like to eat something .
__label__noemo	Good day , Madam . What service do you require today ?
__label__noemo	I got my father ’ s goat last night .
__label__noemo	Mike , I'm afraid I can't come back home for dinner tonight .
__label__noemo	Excellent ! Let ’ s set off .
__label__noemo	I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour .
__label__noemo	Employees are covered by worker's compensation insurance .
__label__noemo	That is true . I ’ ll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It ’ s usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars .
__label__noemo	Does it enjoy popularity among the young generation ?
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__joy	You're going out of your way for us , I believe .
__label__noemo	Well , the way you drive , Jen ... I still don't think that's a good idea .
__label__noemo	I'm very sorry for any inconvenience I've caused you .
__label__joy	Pretty good . Mary , I was wondering if you would like to come to a party on Friday night ?
__label__noemo	Hi , this is China Southern Airlines . Is that Miss . Ye ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , but scented tea is now in fashion .
__label__joy	Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast !
__label__noemo	OK . How much is the fare ?
__label__noemo	Good morning .
__label__noemo	Ugh ... So how long is this going to take ? An hour ?
__label__noemo	That's the reason why you fought ?
__label__joy	4:00 A . M . ? I'm really sorry .
__label__joy	Very good . That may be the most delicious food I have ever eaten .
__label__noemo	But what about settling down to start a family ? Doesn't anyone want to get married any more ?
__label__noemo	My pleasure .
__label__joy	I think we need to buy some baits and borrow some fish poles first .
__label__noemo	I'd like to apply for a credit card with you .
__label__noemo	What dates are you planning on taking off ? I ’ ll need at least two months notice , so that I can plan for your absence .
__label__noemo	Sir , our gym is open around the clock , every day of the week .
__label__surprise	Is there something wrong ? You look so sad .
__label__joy	Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go .
__label__joy	Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	I usually get a lot of information on the computer and use E-mail to send messages to my friends .
__label__noemo	What are the allowances ?
__label__noemo	There ’ s a letter here for you .
__label__joy	Thanks , Mary . You ’ re a real pal . I ’ ll call now to set up an interview .
__label__noemo	I know , it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside .
__label__noemo	I want to change rooms immediately , plus a refund for tonight .
__label__noemo	Yes , it displays some social problems and interprets the values of our white-collars .
__label__noemo	I'm due to check out tomorrow , but I'd like to extend my stay by two days .
__label__noemo	What you said was right , but we need to work as a team , how could you make adjustment to that ?
__label__noemo	But what would other people think ?
__label__noemo	We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders . These are renewable after the first year .
__label__noemo	If you do , I will keep your deductible .
__label__joy	What a beautiful watch . It goes very well with your ring .
__label__joy	Sure , this way please .
__label__noemo	My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot of paperwork , doesn't it ?
__label__noemo	No need to worry . You won't feel anything at all . I'll give you an injection to stop the pain . Just wash your mouth out with this water , will you ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry , Sam . I don't want to go to the folk concert .
__label__noemo	How about your sideburns ?
__label__noemo	Actually , my doctor said the same thing .
__label__noemo	We have 3 different types of boxes . We usually rent for 1 year and the fee depends on the size and location of the box .
__label__noemo	I worked in a foreign representative office for one year . However , I leave there two years ago because the work they gave me was rather dull . I found another job that was more interesting .
__label__noemo	You can't give me a break ?
__label__joy	Thank you , sir . We look forward to welcoming you .
__label__noemo	Shall I go ahead and process them for you ?
__label__joy	You're right . He sure is .
__label__noemo	What would be my daily duties ?
__label__noemo	I did but now I ’ m for Microsoft.How are things with you ?
__label__noemo	Are you going to take the job ?
__label__anger	Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .
__label__noemo	May I get an order of barbeque wings ?
__label__noemo	I think they will .
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	Are you aware of the reason why I pulled you over ?
__label__joy	Sure . Have you checked the weather report ?
__label__joy	She certainly has the taste .
__label__noemo	Not everyone thinks Japan is beautiful , but to me its beauty is breathtaking.You feel the same way about France , don't you ?
__label__noemo	ok , what unusual food do you want to try ?
__label__noemo	Good evening , sir . Are you ready to order now ?
__label__noemo	Zina , I hope you're not scheming to make Elvin look bad .
__label__noemo	Is that you , Bob ?
__label__noemo	How about 50 yuan ?
__label__noemo	Of course , the sports shoes don ’ t go with the formal occasions .
__label__noemo	then why didn ’ t you talk to me ?
__label__noemo	What is the rate , please ?
__label__noemo	There is one next to the post office , round the corner .
__label__joy	All right , see you .
__label__joy	I see . Well , good luck !
__label__noemo	It seems to me that you fall for good-looking guys .
__label__noemo	So , what's the problem ?
__label__noemo	Can I borrow one of your pens , Amy ?
__label__noemo	You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ?
__label__noemo	Yes , but I learned a lot .

__label__noemo	It was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place . It gave me a good idea of your product range .
__label__noemo	Ok . I've got a list of place that fit your requirements . Let's just go through them . The first on the list costs 80 pounds a month , but it's on a noisy street and it's a little far from the university .
__label__joy	That sounds great . So , do you want to have dinner at 6:00 ?
__label__noemo	Because I ’ m not in the mood , that ’ s why .
__label__joy	You ’ re a real friend in need .
__label__noemo	Yes , sir . Is there anything wrong ?
__label__noemo	Most starts with dinner , but then it gets out of hand . Besides , haven't you asked out every woman in the entire office ?
__label__noemo	I doubt it .
__label__joy	Steve , thanks for looking after Johnny .
__label__joy	If you could , please . That would be wonderful , thanks .
__label__noemo	The aroma of roasting coffee beans .
__label__noemo	Man , that was a really close game .
__label__noemo	May I know how long will it take to get some more in from the factory ?
__label__noemo	I think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends , and then the right person will come along .
__label__noemo	The bartender just gave the last call . Let's order another round , okay ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s a small fee ?

__label__noemo	You and your fancy Italian names .
__label__joy	That's really cheap . I will take it .
__label__noemo	If you make every effort to the company , you will have a great chance to attend the on-the-job postgraduate . The tuition fee will be financed by our company .
__label__joy	It's nice and bright today , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	Not at all . Please sit down , then we can begin .
__label__noemo	It's a weekly newspaper named Olympic English . So I need to be here only on Sunday .
__label__noemo	Uh ... yeah , right ...
__label__fear	I think someone is stalking me .
__label__noemo	Does it have a large circulation ?
__label__noemo	Three years . They've been dating since freshman year . They're even talking about marriage .
__label__noemo	As a matter of fact , I am .
__label__noemo	No , I'm sorry I don't . I never read the papers till I get home .
__label__noemo	Where is he ? Is he in danger ?
__label__noemo	Are you joking ? What am I going to do with you ? We are going to a dinner party not the beach ! Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and these corduroy pants . It ’ s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
__label__anger	To hell with you .
__label__noemo	I've looked at your units , and am very happy with them . Your goods are all far above standard quality .
__label__joy	I see . You are in luck this month because all of our models are on sale ! it is a perfect time to buy a new car since it ’ s the end of the year .
__label__noemo	I wonder if you could do me a favor .
__label__noemo	She is tall ?
__label__surprise	Really ? Quite a woman , isn ’ t she ?
__label__noemo	hey , come on . It ’ s too early to say that . We can fix things .
__label__joy	Good idea . We can buy some candy and nuts for children .
__label__noemo	Let's see . We spent 700 dollars for our home loan payment , 400 on groceries , 75 on utilities , 250 on gasoline , 100 on books and 300 on entertainment last month .
__label__joy	Great . I'll bring the food .
__label__noemo	Yes . Do you know its name .
__label__noemo	That sounds like a good idea . We can chill out a little in such a hot summer . Are you good at swimming ?
__label__noemo	Does he often beat his son ?
__label__noemo	... sir ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s true . You should be happy about that .
__label__noemo	Hello !
__label__noemo	I plan to arrive on August fifth and leave on August eighth .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	Yes ! The first time I saw her I knew we would fall in love .

__label__noemo	Yeah . If I leave Little Italy alive ...
__label__joy	Of course . How much would you want to ensure this books for ?
__label__noemo	There is no doubt that the Brazilian team will win .
__label__noemo	Some people believe that a tough approach is better . Other prefer a more lenient approach .
__label__noemo	Yes , arm , I'm 23 . I've been working abroad , I'm um ...
__label__noemo	Yes.She teaches our class three times a week .
__label__noemo	Hmm , I guess on the 28th .
__label__noemo	Great .
__label__noemo	Won ’ t you come in , Mr . Barker ?
__label__joy	You are very nice to tell me those .
__label__noemo	So what can we do ?
__label__surprise	Didn't I tell you ? We're moving to Florida ?
__label__joy	Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ?
__label__anger	Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy or a kitty !
__label__noemo	Yes , they can . If you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat .
__label__noemo	Well , Anthony , this is not going to be an easy conversation.The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment .
__label__sadness	No , I'm afraid not . We only accept our own store credit card .
__label__noemo	You'll need to make an appointment .
__label__noemo	I think that we should let someone know . They will probably want to fix the problem .
__label__noemo	What time would you like us to deliver it ?
__label__noemo	I hope you'll try to get them to step up production .
__label__joy	you are very lucky to have such a nice family .
__label__noemo	How much is it ?
__label__noemo	Okay , sir , bear with me a moment .
__label__noemo	That's so convenient . Where are the dirty clothes ?

__label__noemo	yeah , why not . Do you have all the ingredients ?
__label__joy	No problem.Step in , please .

__label__noemo	Today is May first , 2003 .
__label__noemo	What did you get for lunch today ?
__label__noemo	And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . My father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day .
__label__noemo	Well , haven't you ever heard people say that there is always one piece of clothes missing from a woman's wardrobe ?
__label__noemo	We usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks , but apart from that , summers are dry . Thunderstorms make the air fresh again , so most people don ’ t mind then .
__label__noemo	Hey , Susie , what health club do you belong to ?
__label__noemo	We're in a very competitive environment . It's sink or saimin this market .
__label__noemo	Well , I see the cable . But my computer runs on wireless only .
__label__noemo	You liar , I saw you again in the inn . I bet you don't want to work at all .
__label__noemo	May I venture to ask if you've decided to employ Mark ?
__label__noemo	You've made a good choice . This china tea set is unusual . It was made in Jingdezhen .
__label__noemo	Yeah , you get the TV to yourself while I spend my nights surfing the Net for missing classmates .
__label__noemo	Why have you been learning Japanese ? Why not English ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits .
__label__noemo	yes . I can show you examples of some footages that was taken with this camera in the dark .
__label__noemo	I'd like to take some money from my Fund Account at the Securities Company . Is that possible here ?
__label__noemo	What are you doing tomorrow ?

__label__joy	Thanks . This shipment is so important to us there cannot be any foul-ups .
__label__noemo	So how do you develop good relationships in the office ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I can't seem to drink enough .
__label__noemo	Not too worry , so tell me about yourself .
__label__noemo	A compact please . What's the daily rate for that car ?
__label__noemo	But the competition is fierce this year ... and it seems like I'm the only one left who hasn't found a job .
__label__noemo	Yes . The German engineer would never dreamed that the hand - supported scooter he invented several years ago to solve his traffic problems would become so fashionable in the Occident within a few years and even spread to Japan and China .
__label__noemo	I know , I know . But you always bat around without doing things useful .
__label__noemo	Is that right ?
__label__noemo	John , have you ever watched Beijing Opera ?
__label__joy	No I am free , I will be there , what time the thing starting ?
__label__noemo	Could you tell me how to use the library ?
__label__noemo	This machine is out of order .
__label__joy	You are so interesting .
__label__noemo	Well , my roommate was friends with Amanda , so he introduced us .
__label__noemo	When you told your mom you would be home around 2 am , She must have a cow !
__label__noemo	How about I tire myself out , and then fall asleep when I'm tired ?
__label__noemo	It should stop you from overdrafting .
__label__noemo	It doesn't matter , you need to get some sleep .
__label__noemo	How many people are in your family ?
__label__joy	Hmm . Not bad . I think I look younger with shorter hair .
__label__noemo	So it's the subjective criteria like team building and colleague support that you find hard ?
__label__noemo	I know what you mean .
__label__noemo	She will want an excellent restaurant , of course .
__label__noemo	Yes , five years ago . I began to work in a fashion company in Shanghai . Two years ago , I came to Beijing , and worked in a department store as a salesman .
__label__noemo	Howdy folks , and welcome to today ’ s game ! You know , Rick , today is a key game between Russia and Canada . As you know , the winner will move on to the finals .

__label__noemo	Good morning . I'm interested in antiques . Do you have any ?
__label__noemo	ok , you're right . I'll just tell them how round I am of you for getting a promotion and then I'll thank Sue for her kind letter .
__label__noemo	I must praise you for your modesty and diligence . What's your plan next ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I love apple pie too .
__label__noemo	Well , I'm thinking of going to see the ballet Swan Lake by the famous Russian National Ballet Troupe this evening at Beijing Grand Theater . Why don't you join me ?
__label__noemo	I completely understand . I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choicest , you've got to adapt .
__label__noemo	It depends on which train do you take .
__label__noemo	For how many people ?
__label__noemo	Great ... Well , let me tell you that I am very pleased with this interview . We are short-listing our candidates this week , and next week we will inform our short listed candidates of the day and time for a second interview with our CEO .
__label__noemo	If everyone turned up , it would be a squeeze , but a few people said that they couldn ’ t go , so I think it should be ok ?
__label__noemo	Hello , my name is Xu Hua . I'm from Beijing .
__label__joy	well , this is my stop . it was nice talking with you .
__label__noemo	I just feel funny .
__label__noemo	Nonsense ! The business schools measure your ability through a test called GMAT .
__label__noemo	Yes , the control unit is on the wall next to the bathroom . Is 24 ° C all right ?
__label__joy	Well , I want to let your boss know that she ’ d better hold on to you ! You ’ re a hard worker !
__label__noemo	Just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem .
__label__noemo	That's too bad . What happened ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me . We ordered too much . May we take the food home ?
__label__noemo	So , what programs do you have on your laptop ?
__label__noemo	You have many trees in your country . That ’ s another natural resources .
__label__anger	Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?
__label__noemo	What isn't working on it ?
__label__joy	Thanks , I like looking at photographs . How nice ! Oh , I'm afraid I must be going now . I've got an appointment . Have a good day .
__label__noemo	OK . What ?
__label__noemo	No , but I'll make sure someone helps me out this week with my missed work .
__label__noemo	Certainly . First , I would like to ask you some questions to identify your needs before I show you what we have .
__label__noemo	Our pleasure . We have several package tours you may choose , from ten days to three weeks in Europe .
__label__noemo	Help ! I'm about to drop these books .
__label__noemo	Hi , I'd like to return this radio .
__label__noemo	What can I do ? I have things to do in Students ' Government .
__label__noemo	Okay . I'm going to stay up a while . I've got to go over the household budget . We're a little overspent this month .
__label__noemo	I understand why you ’ re angry , Mrs . Wilson , and believe me , we are doing everything in our power to work this out .
__label__joy	That's really convenient . Does it have the Bluetooth ?
__label__noemo	Fill out this exchange memo , please .
__label__noemo	About five weeks .
__label__noemo	This is what my boss is expecting , Sandy . He wants a detailed list of expenses and equipment costs .
__label__noemo	I'm sure he could , but I prefer not to bother him . Would my bank do ?
__label__noemo	No , usually they're very busy .
__label__noemo	No , double nine zero two .
__label__noemo	All right . I graduated and got the degree of bachelor of economics from Nanjing University 4 years ago . My major is international trade .
__label__sadness	I doubt if I can pass it .
__label__noemo	People who are honest , dedicated to their work and having integrity .
__label__noemo	Pale yellow .
__label__noemo	Do you help with the housework ?
__label__noemo	Why not ? Oh well , I'm ready to eat . No need call the doctor . If we run to the restaurant , I can make it to the restroom and you can order .
__label__noemo	All is best now , isn ’ t it ?
__label__noemo	Evening , table for three , please .
__label__noemo	Please come in

__label__noemo	Well , I guess I could give you one more chance , but this is the last time.In themeantime , I hear that Tom who normally does night shift is taking three weeks ' vacation , Can you think of anyone who would be willing to work nights while he is gone ?
__label__noemo	I see you have several good ideas . Now , I just have a few questions about your C . V . I notice that there is a five-year gap between your last job and now .
__label__noemo	He nursed a viper in his bosom . His best friend Tony foamed him in . Tony first seduced his wife and then trapped him .
__label__noemo	Well , considering our long standing good business relationship , we'll try hard to negotiate with our manufacturers for an earlier delivery .
__label__noemo	Hah hah ! You have to go before me .
__label__noemo	Did you take the written test ?
__label__sadness	I am sorry , sir , it's for 4 persons to have . I think it's too large for you .
__label__noemo	Oh , I think I'd like to take the monthly savings account then .
__label__joy	Exactly how short do you want it ?
__label__noemo	Just tor three days . I won't need these luggages.CouId I put them here ?

__label__noemo	Excuse me , do the buses stop here ?
__label__noemo	What did he say ?
__label__noemo	Oh , that's too bad . Where can you park around here ?
__label__noemo	What is that ?
__label__noemo	You can buy them at the souvenir shop near the exit .
__label__noemo	Oh , it's out of stock at the moment . Why don't you choose another brand instead ?
__label__joy	No , thank you . I had too much to drink yesterday evening . I had a bad hangover this morning . My head felt terrible .
__label__noemo	Yesterday when I went to hospital to see her , you cannot imagine how greatly surprised when I saw her .
__label__noemo	I don't think so .
__label__surprise	That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ?
__label__noemo	I bought it online .
__label__noemo	Two men pushed into the flat . One of them threatened me with a knife while the other bound and gagged me .
__label__noemo	So , Monica , what do you feel like doing this afternoon ?
__label__noemo	Welcome to IBA Consumer Credit . What can I assist you with ?
__label__noemo	Yes , that's right . We want as much info as possible before we agree to anything .

__label__noemo	Here ’ s your key.Check out time is 12 noon.If you want to stay until 6 p . m . , it ’ s another half day.After that you have to pay for another night .
__label__noemo	What about this one ? It's natural ingredients .

__label__noemo	That would be wonderful .
__label__noemo	No . I think a half gallon will be enough .
__label__noemo	Next Friday .
__label__noemo	You won't believe it , but it was really cheap .
__label__noemo	May I have your order , please ?
__label__noemo	But you really should let me treat one time , I feel like I own you one if I didn't .
__label__joy	Yes . It ’ s easy and convenient to use a computer . But it takes a long time to really master it .
__label__noemo	Yeah , what was all that stuff about running tests about anyway ?
__label__noemo	Thank you for your interest in our company .
__label__joy	Yes . I am very glad to have the chance .
__label__noemo	Sure , but how ?

__label__joy	Wow ! She's gorgeous .
__label__noemo	Yes , it's got wireless Internet access .
__label__noemo	I wish it didn't have cruise control . My wife doesn't like it either .
__label__noemo	So you must get higher pay than before .
__label__noemo	What is the great trait in your personality ?
__label__noemo	Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ?
__label__noemo	When will that be ?
__label__joy	There ’ s a concert tonight . Would you like to go and listen to it ?
__label__noemo	Is that the Japanese Restaurant ?
__label__noemo	Just a minute you two . I don't think you're telling me the truth . This isn't poorhouse , is it ?
__label__noemo	Stolen ? No , why ?
__label__noemo	I can't remember , but I've got the receipt somewhere . Would you like to see it ?
__label__joy	This is a really great place to watch a baseball game .
__label__noemo	I've arranged for an interpreter to be present . But it is said these foreigners could speak English .
__label__noemo	Certainly . I ’ Ve already worked out a general budget for all the departments .
__label__noemo	We'd better get back to work .
__label__noemo	How do you know ? I thought Taiwanese people didn't have garage sales .
__label__noemo	Yes , Ms . Reese . I remember , you spoke with me . Is there a problem ?
__label__noemo	I want to get a puppy for my son .
__label__noemo	I need to find a new way of getting my insurance .
__label__noemo	No , I had it when I left school this afternoon .
__label__noemo	We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River .
__label__noemo	Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
__label__joy	No , but I did notice that she was very interested in the art supplies !
__label__noemo	I'd totally die if she turned me down .
__label__noemo	Yes , I do .
__label__noemo	If I'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me .
__label__noemo	It is 260 dollars .
__label__noemo	Huh ?
__label__noemo	I finished off everything .
__label__noemo	It depends on who the film is about . Which movie did you have in mind ?
__label__noemo	and you don't have to work under that much pressure and control .
__label__noemo	Both my items will fit under the seat or in the overhead bin .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . can you tell me where Main Street is ?
__label__noemo	No , she ’ s running toward our house . That ’ s her ringing the bell .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	I am very proud of John .
__label__noemo	Oh . I am not his fan .
__label__noemo	This is my friend Jenny .
__label__noemo	Oh , I'm hoping to take courses in my vacation .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . Are these chips on sale ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , I want my own house very much , so I decide to buy one .
__label__noemo	Not quite , Sir . We will need to also know the account number , the deposited amount and your PIN number . You will also have to come in and fill out some forms .
__label__noemo	I thought you didn't talk to them much .
__label__joy	It is so kind of you , Dad .
__label__noemo	Just fine , and you ?
__label__noemo	Of course I do !
__label__disgust	My husband goes out drinking with his friends every night . I'm fed up with it .
__label__noemo	Yes , he has been like that since his accident .
__label__noemo	Well . There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them .
__label__noemo	Sorry I was late for the meeting today . I got stuck in traffic .
__label__noemo	Are you having any luck with the worms ?
__label__noemo	( The customer gets the aspirin and vitamins . ) That'll be $ 16.00 .
__label__noemo	Do you know when it leaves ?
__label__noemo	I've got to go to bed . Have to work tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ?
__label__joy	Shall we have a game together some day ?
__label__noemo	hey , Tom , did you enjoy your lunch ?
__label__noemo	May I have your name , please ?
__label__noemo	It was so cold this morning . I could hardly start my car .
__label__joy	Great . Where is it ?
__label__noemo	This is Tim . Hunter from Hunter industries .
__label__noemo	I feel I work harder when I am under pressure .
__label__noemo	I don't have my passport on me at the moment . I'll just pop back to my office and pick it up .
__label__noemo	Oh , these ? Hmm ... Yellow isn't a good color for me .
__label__surprise	Why not ?
__label__noemo	This is my admission card , and these are the books .
__label__noemo	You can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them .
__label__noemo	Can you tell me the best way to see the city ?
__label__noemo	I agree . People who don't read are no better often people who can't read . I also agree that books are like food for the mind .
__label__noemo	Will you tell us if we are failing during the year ?
__label__noemo	Not really . Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre , especially in the main shopping areas . The public transport system is pretty good .
__label__noemo	Oh , come on . That ’ s such a girl ’ s show .
__label__noemo	Oh , you like the rolling machine .
__label__noemo	What day is today ?
__label__noemo	Are you deaf or what ?
__label__noemo	What year is it ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s another 15 miles , so that ’ s 22 miles total so far .
__label__noemo	I would be happy to answer any questions you might have .
__label__noemo	That ’ s fine .
__label__noemo	Maybe you need a vacation or something , or maybe a bonus .
__label__noemo	To be frank with you , I would like nothing better than to be an overseas reporter some day .
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve read your application materials with interest . Now I want to ask you a few questions , if you don ’ t mind .
__label__noemo	Do you think you'll be interested in studying law later ?
__label__noemo	O . K . Let ’ s compromise , if you agree to only spend $ 75 on books , I ’ ll agree to only spend $ 40 for my next shirt .
__label__noemo	What can I help you with today ?
__label__noemo	How many countries have been affected ?
__label__noemo	Are you ? What are you busy with ?
__label__noemo	Where do we get off at ?
__label__noemo	Let's eat out .
__label__noemo	but I always get tongue-tied when I see her .
__label__noemo	Today people are hearing about information superhighways and the intermet .
__label__noemo	Oh , but why ?
__label__noemo	What computer languages have you learned ?
__label__noemo	Good morning . What's the matter with you ?
__label__noemo	Take good care of yourself .
__label__anger	No , mine !
__label__noemo	All right . I got it . What color is your car ?
__label__noemo	It's our pleasure . And is there anything else we can do for you before you leave here ?
__label__noemo	By the way , does acupuncture hurt ?
__label__noemo	what are they ?
__label__noemo	Yes , fine . I had something wrong with my stomach . I won ’ t go into detail , but it wasn ’ t serious .
__label__joy	During my trip here , I learned a lot and I get to know our choice of choosing your company as our partner is definitely right . I can feel and sense the potential of your company . And at last I wish our further cooperation will be sound and successful .
__label__noemo	Couldn ’ t be better . And you ?
__label__joy	My pleasure .
__label__noemo	No , I'll have the fish please .
__label__noemo	No probation is involved . If you feel good , you can start next week .
__label__noemo	Good morning , and welcome to Live Tech . It is my honor to make this presentation for you . Let me begin by explaining some of our digital cameras ' selling points . You will see immediately that they are very stylish , but what you can't see is the cutting-edge technology inside . All of our cameras are light , compact , and easy to use .
__label__noemo	Here you are , madam . All these are sixteens .
__label__joy	Yeah , the scenery is beautiful . What's more , the air is fresh here ?
__label__noemo	Shall we have some white wine then ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m studying for my chemistry exam tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Fine , Mr . Emory . Let me just grab a pad and pen .
__label__noemo	Set your heart at rest . I keep this in my mind .
__label__noemo	You may give them to your friends who come to see you off . This is the Customs Declaration Form . Please fill in it . And then you can go through the other formalities . Be sure to keep the form safe .
__label__noemo	Is that yellow bus it ?
__label__anger	I've had enough .
__label__joy	Yes , that seems to be all in order . Thanks very much .
__label__noemo	Flares ?
__label__noemo	You're right .
__label__noemo	I'll be studying . I'm doing an MBA at Nottingham University .
__label__noemo	When do you plan to travel ?
__label__noemo	I would like to open a savings account .
__label__noemo	Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO ’ s with low co-pays and good coverage . The deductibles are low , too .
__label__noemo	No , thank you.My husband likes steak , but he doesn't like chicken .
__label__noemo	Then you should write your objectives , such as seeking a position in foreign trade .
__label__noemo	Try a Stinger . It has lime juice and grenadine over ice .
__label__noemo	The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact to success . If I want to make in marking in advertising industry , I can ’ t stop studying and creating .
__label__noemo	Yes , she gets along with them quite well .
__label__noemo	Yes it is very easy to use and each system installation comes with a 3 - day employee training seminar .
__label__noemo	Mom , I'm ready for school .
__label__noemo	I'll say , she is really stacked , isn't she ?
__label__noemo	They are fragile articles . They must be packed in a proper strong box . Your light cardboard box won't do .
__label__noemo	To be fair , both the costumes and scenery are marvelous .
__label__noemo	You needn't worry about that . Cartons are extensively used in our shipments to foreign countries and there have never been complaints from our clients . Now , as regards payment , we have agreed to use dollars , am I right ?
__label__noemo	I have never used an ATM before .
__label__noemo	If you like to play so much , when do you ever exercise ?
__label__surprise	Really ? How long did it take you to find a spot yesterday ?
__label__noemo	Why are you in such a hurry ? They said , Dinner at eight , and it ’ s only seven-fifteen . I don ’ t want to be the first one there again .
__label__noemo	That ’ s all .
__label__joy	While the pale color symbolizes beauty and elegance in most Asia countries .
__label__noemo	Will the house be mine when we finish these documents ?
__label__joy	Ok , I will see you again .
__label__noemo	Gynecology ?
__label__surprise	Some what ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I want to get a better job .
__label__noemo	Oh , why such a high mileage ?
__label__noemo	That's exactly how I feel now .
__label__joy	They basically turn their bodies into drums . There's a national step competition every year .
__label__noemo	Right , but the negotiation has been postponed until 5th to 7th of April . Do you think it's possible for us to change the reservation ?
__label__noemo	Jenny , you look terrible . What's eating you ?
__label__noemo	Yes . That would be good .
__label__noemo	I like pop music . Do you ?
__label__noemo	May I have your room number 。 Sir ?
__label__noemo	He is too scared to ask her .
__label__noemo	It's time to graduate and it's time to find a job . Susan , why do we need to find a job ?
__label__noemo	Well , since you're a foreign student , it's hard.That ' s because it's actually illegal for you to work in America .
__label__noemo	Of course . Here you are .
__label__noemo	Well , I ’ Ve got the spread sheets you asked for , but I ’ m still waiting on some data from accounting .
__label__noemo	Hello , Elizabeth . How are you ?
__label__noemo	Does your husband feel the same ?
__label__noemo	Fine , we'll be expecting you then .
__label__noemo	No , ice will spoil the taste .
__label__noemo	Salt or no salt ?
__label__noemo	Have you a wine list ?
__label__noemo	Bad luck , Anne .
__label__noemo	That one will bring you many hours of pleasure .
__label__noemo	Were there any animals in the forest ?
__label__noemo	I didn ’ t even think about that .
__label__noemo	Our first choice would be 7
__label__surprise	It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day .
__label__joy	Good . How about this picture of cranes with pine trees ? It was painted by a famous Chinese painter in King Dynasty .
__label__noemo	I found it at a garage sale once .
__label__noemo	No , thanks . I am okay .
__label__noemo	I'll need a parking permit for next semester .
__label__noemo	Don't hesitate . That's a very famous university which a lot of students are longing to attain .
__label__noemo	How long will it take if I walk ?
__label__joy	Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can do it very well . Then I'll meet you at six . Is that at all right ?
__label__joy	OK .
__label__noemo	"What about the expression "" goodbye "" ? Is that an idiom ?"
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__noemo	That's OK .
__label__noemo	They are , keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
__label__noemo	Not at all . We can adjust the payment methods depending on the requirement of each employee .
__label__noemo	Can you speak other languages except English ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it's definitely a growing business .
__label__noemo	Well , do you like novels ?
__label__noemo	Thank you very much ! How long have you been working here ?
__label__noemo	Miss Wang , would you mind my asking you a personal question ?
__label__noemo	You don ’ t look so good .
__label__noemo	No . That's all , I guess .
__label__noemo	How much should I pay for the excess weight ?
__label__joy	My pleasure .
__label__noemo	On and off , for quite a few years .
__label__joy	So that's how it is ! Now he ’ s in trouble , but I belive he will rise to his own feet again .
__label__noemo	OK.What do you want to know ?
__label__noemo	Of course not.You need a good rest .
__label__noemo	I just meant that she's got different taste .
__label__noemo	Well , can I start you off with some cocktails while you are looking over the menu ?
__label__noemo	Well , I know that he would never stab me in the back.But I've seen him double cross other people .
__label__noemo	Hello , I bought a China dress in your shop this morning .
__label__noemo	I would like to buy a ticket to New York please .
__label__joy	It sounds interesting . I'll take one .
__label__noemo	Correct . I have expected to visit here for a long time . So fortunate for me , I can realize this expectation and meet you , Arden , and your kind-hearted staff in your company .
__label__noemo	Sure . Here you are .
__label__noemo	What is the tariff ?
__label__noemo	OK , Madam . We are here to help .
__label__noemo	That's right .
__label__noemo	I ’ m in pretty bad shape , Doctor Ford .
__label__noemo	What color is it ?
__label__joy	How about a dinner tonight ? My treat .
__label__noemo	But I don't know what I would do .
__label__noemo	You want to bet ?
__label__noemo	Yes that ’ s right . I ’ Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I ’ m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed academically .
__label__noemo	Hello . I sent out my laundry yesterday.Aren ' t they ready ?
__label__noemo	Well , the universe is a chaotic place , and the gravity from one galaxy , or from a group of galaxies , may disturb the motion of its near neighbors , causing them to collide . However , on average , when you compare two large enough chunks of space , the galaxies in one are moving away from the galaxies in the other .
__label__noemo	This is a membership card . You can get a 20 percent discount next time .
__label__noemo	Try to keep cool . It's not an easy take .
__label__noemo	I don't want to talk about it .
__label__noemo	I agreed to not go into the mall , but I can still look at things in the market !
__label__joy	Thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight .
__label__joy	we'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square !
__label__joy	Fabulous . I will get the contract ready shortly .
__label__joy	Thank you , goodbye .
__label__noemo	But I ...
__label__noemo	Please notice all of our aisles are numbered and classified by signs on the ceiling . That might help you .
__label__noemo	It will be a long story . We have many differences , for example , she usually puts all her clothes into washing machine . That is the sort of thing I can not bear .
__label__noemo	This sheet tells the visiting hours and funeral time and location .
__label__joy	Yes , and I am very satisfied with it .
__label__joy	Thanks . By the way , tell your wife she throws a great party .
__label__surprise	Oh , yeah ?
__label__noemo	It will leave at 3:00 p . m .
__label__joy	Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now .
__label__noemo	that's alright . I notice you have a few newspapers there . Would you mind lending me one ?
__label__joy	That's all , thank you .
__label__noemo	That's cool . I'll watch it .
__label__noemo	I'm the Project Manager so I have to make sure our projects run smoothly . I work with three Project Engineers . They take care of after-sales service and look after the maintenance side of the business .
__label__noemo	Yes . Do you know where it is ?
__label__noemo	What's the tattoo on her foot like ?
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__noemo	Huh , that is no reason to demand a birth certificate . We only need to establish residency , you know , a phone bill with your name and address on it would have been fine .
__label__noemo	no , we are just too different . This isn ’ t working .
__label__noemo	Your room number is 505 . This is your key . The bellboy will help you with the baggage .
__label__noemo	About fifteen minutes .
__label__noemo	3,500 yuan .
__label__noemo	Oh , darling , we must stand shoulder to shoulder and face the music . I know you can pull yourself together .
__label__noemo	Do you have any sales experience ?
__label__joy	Welcome to my shop next time .
__label__joy	Not at all .
__label__noemo	I'd like her to have a change .
__label__disgust	Oh , yeah , it ’ s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt .
__label__noemo	Let's put our suitcases on the rack .
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__noemo	Damp it ! How are you killing me with a single shot ? It ’ s not fair ! I don ’ t want to play anymore ! Let ’ s go get something to eat .
__label__noemo	She's a lot like me .
__label__noemo	Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up .
__label__noemo	Yes , Mr . Emory ?
__label__noemo	The boat is ready to leave.Everyone come onto the ship , please .
__label__joy	Hope so !
__label__noemo	I see , well , I think I ’ m more interested in a chequing account . I like to have easy access to my money .
__label__noemo	See you .
__label__noemo	Your major must be computer .
__label__noemo	I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team .
__label__noemo	well , I ’ m very good with people . I ’ m honorable . I work hard . I work well under pressure . And I ’ m patient .
__label__noemo	What ?
__label__noemo	Do you want to know the honest answer ?
__label__noemo	That's fine . We can supply all kinds of precision machine tools . Our products are much admired in the world market and enjoy a wide acceptance in modern industry .
__label__noemo	I don't know . I just woke up .
__label__noemo	Why did you go there ?
__label__noemo	Hello . May I speak to Mary , please ?
__label__joy	Would you like to have some more wine ?
__label__noemo	How much for a bus pass ?
__label__noemo	Can I buy everything in the supermarket by it ? .
__label__joy	Very nice . I am sure we will sort out your Internet in no time .
__label__noemo	Mr . Smith is not in his office . I am afraid he will not be back before 3 pm . Would you care to speak to Mr . Brown who takes all the calls in his absence ?
__label__noemo	No problem . That can be done . I understand you'll ship the goods before the end of May ?
__label__noemo	What time is it ?
__label__noemo	So he talks about you behind your back ?
__label__noemo	Working with my colleagues , we were able to increase the production efficiency by 5 % .
__label__noemo	Can you change American dollars into French francs ?
__label__joy	What perfect timing !
__label__noemo	Yes , in Paris , France .
__label__noemo	It's a wise thing to do . Art will do a child a world of good .
__label__noemo	I was planning on doing a lot of wallowing .
__label__joy	Helen gets on very well with her neighbours . I wouldn ’ t be surprised if they went to the party too .
__label__noemo	Yes , but it takes a while to find things . It's not organized as carefully as a regular store .
__label__noemo	Good morning , Dr Lee .
__label__noemo	Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad .
__label__noemo	Have a nice holiday !
__label__noemo	Did he let you ride it ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m taking BA fright 123 to London . Can you tell me where the reporting desk is , please ?
__label__noemo	Do you think we ’ ll have a nice summer this year ?
__label__joy	really ? It sounds interesting .
__label__noemo	I like the different instruments that they use .
__label__noemo	Some days are just like that .
__label__noemo	I am Jason Armstrong . My first initial is J .
__label__noemo	No , that's too early . I'll still be at work then .
__label__joy	Same here .
__label__noemo	I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! Can you come here for a sec ? I need your help .
__label__noemo	What is it ?
__label__noemo	I won ’ t be able to pay that right now .
__label__noemo	The Northern Line is what you want .
__label__noemo	The robber came in with a gun .
__label__noemo	I prefer strong .
__label__noemo	What's up ? You look unhappy .
__label__noemo	do you want to attend the convocation ?
__label__sadness	I ’ m sorry . Our company has just opened . There are always too many things to handle . You know that .
__label__noemo	They're in Aisle Two .
__label__noemo	It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you .
__label__noemo	Yes , I got it . Thanks .
__label__noemo	I see . Do you ski often ?
__label__noemo	Well , that'll teach you to control your temper .
__label__noemo	You know the car I'm driving , which is still in good condition though it is second-hand . And it only cost me 300 dollars . It was so cheap .
__label__noemo	Yes , I want to buy a VCR .
__label__noemo	I see .
__label__noemo	Do you have medical insurance ?
__label__noemo	What's the weather forecast for today ?
__label__noemo	Well , I swim and run every day .
__label__noemo	They usually do .
__label__noemo	Yes , it is . Conrad is gay . Didn't you know ?
__label__noemo	Would you give me a bottle of beer , please ?
__label__noemo	I don ’ t know . Let me see .
__label__noemo	Fair-Priced Fares , how may I help you ?
__label__noemo	Have you got it now ?
__label__noemo	What do you know about our company ?
__label__joy	I'm a great driver .
__label__noemo	Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway .
__label__joy	Oh ! That's much hetter than I did .
__label__joy	Women have often played an important role in British history . Queen Elizabeth I built a navy strong enough to fight off the Spanish armada in 1588 . more recently , Margaret thatcher transformed british society in the 1980 ’ s .
__label__noemo	What are your salary expectations ?
__label__noemo	How old is she ?
__label__noemo	My name is Monica Cellar .
__label__noemo	well , what's the problem then ?
__label__noemo	Do you have a bed ?
__label__noemo	Huh ? Um ... well , it's nice to see that some people still have big families .
__label__joy	Have a nice weekend !
__label__noemo	His wife always complained that Kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion .
__label__noemo	It ’ s open from 6:30 a.m.to 10 p.m.every day .
__label__noemo	And he is English ! He makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical British accent .
__label__noemo	That's interesting to travel by boat to see the whole city that is between the sea and sky . But personally I like Greek better .
__label__noemo	Yes , it is .
__label__noemo	yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center .
__label__noemo	Yeah , Malia would be able to help us choose a concert .
__label__noemo	I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money from once currency to another . I often travel abroad , you see .
__label__joy	How do you do , Ms . Yang.You speak very good English .
__label__noemo	I understand .
__label__noemo	All Right .
__label__noemo	Probably , Iris . That must be the job of nutritionists .
__label__noemo	Is it ? Mine is climbing mountains on Sunday mornings .
__label__noemo	I bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch TV or read a book . Then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat .
__label__noemo	What shall I do today ?
__label__noemo	Well , first I would like to know if this position is still available .
__label__noemo	I've quit it already . I go to aerobics class everyday instead .
__label__noemo	All right , sir . I'll have someone to take you there . By the way , is he insured ?
__label__noemo	With cold milk ?
__label__noemo	How many students are in the class ?
__label__joy	Thanks for the warning .
__label__noemo	Not bad . But we have lost a few of staff lately .
__label__noemo	Do you have anything which can prevent wrinkles and freckles ?
__label__noemo	I warmed a couple of snails , and your eggs are in the frying pan .
__label__joy	Pretty good . I ’ Ve just had my new poems published .
__label__noemo	That's not the way to solve the problem . Did you look in the classified advertisements column ?
__label__joy	My pleasure . Have you seen the movie yet ?
__label__noemo	Is that me ?
__label__noemo	Good morning , Oriental Electric Limited .
__label__noemo	Hey , Anna , this is Jason .
__label__noemo	Yeah , sure , you won't be disappointed .
__label__noemo	Hi , Ann . I was wondering if you are free tomorrow night ?
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__noemo	Here you are . You left the medicine here .
__label__noemo	With the development of the society and technology , radio is nearly everywhere .
__label__joy	I'm glad too . Steven , I want to tell you that I'm going to divorce my wife .
__label__joy	It's great . I really get to focus on what I like to do and everyone has been very nice and welcoming . However , I'm having a small problem with my new colleagues .
__label__noemo	That wardrobe looks quite big . Is it full of clothes ?
__label__noemo	See you .
__label__noemo	Of course .
__label__noemo	The cowl-neck pullovers are new in . It sells like hot cakes .
__label__joy	Let's skip The X-files tonight , Fran . Okay ? Just this once ?
__label__noemo	Would you please bring us a menu ?
__label__noemo	Economy class will be fine .
__label__noemo	See you .
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__noemo	Is it really completely flat ?
__label__noemo	I don't think we are boring . It's just that we don't have any hobbies .
__label__joy	That would be perfect , thank you .
__label__noemo	How are you going to get there ?
__label__sadness	I hate to tell you this , but it seems that every shred of evidence that would help us to convict were destroyed in a laboratory fire . There's nothing left . I'm so sorry ...
__label__noemo	Hope so ! Good thing is that autumn is just around the corner .
__label__noemo	I need you to tell me what the problem is .
__label__noemo	They're discussing whether they should replace Miss Smith , the Music teacher .
__label__noemo	It doesn't matter because we will still have to call the electrician out , and they are union labor . It'll cost you a pretty penny ...
__label__sadness	Well . I can't find my key now . I think I have lost it .
__label__noemo	Let me have it , please . I'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway .
__label__noemo	Then what about spring ?
__label__noemo	Do you know the news ?
__label__noemo	It doesn't matter . Forget it .
__label__noemo	Some people say that history repeats itself .
__label__noemo	Last week , madam ? I really can't remember which ones you mean . What were they like ?
__label__noemo	You've been always active and versatile . It seems that you are interested in everything .
__label__joy	I love eggplant ! Unfortunately , it ’ s quite expensive in my country , so I don ’ t eat it often .
__label__noemo	I have a TEFL certificate .
__label__joy	Well done !
__label__joy	Hey Suzie . Guess what ? I'm having a baby !
__label__noemo	You're on .
__label__noemo	Oh no , I can't tell you . It's a secret . Say , why don't you go over by the lily pads and try fishing there ?
__label__noemo	Of course , I will .
__label__noemo	I'd like to withdraw some money .
__label__noemo	Where do you want to be in 5 years ?
__label__noemo	You are obligated to maintain your building and my apartment .
__label__noemo	I'm telling you the truth .
__label__noemo	Well , she'll probably just give me my invitation later on today .
__label__noemo	Yes , speaking .
__label__noemo	What did you do ?
__label__noemo	Yes , there's central air conditioning and heating . The thermostat is in the living room 。
__label__noemo	No , I don't think comedies today are natural or cheerful .
__label__noemo	Don't worry , you'll find a way .
__label__noemo	I think that will over-process your hair , you should wait at least two weeks .
__label__joy	Fine . I'll be expecting you around two .
__label__noemo	I think women excel in every sport except the ones that are taboo for us to join in , like football .
__label__noemo	Is he ? Yes , he looks pale . Is there anything I can do for him ?
__label__noemo	Bingo ! I never thought about that before . I am working so hard and my accomplishment is significant , you know .
__label__noemo	Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?
__label__noemo	All right . I'm going to the McDonald's .
__label__joy	I'm very glad to hear that .
__label__noemo	Out in the suburbs . It's a long trip to work every day .
__label__noemo	I agree .
__label__joy	Lisa , I am told you did very well in your exam .
__label__noemo	Yes , I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . I spent 3 years in that position , but to be honest it wasn ’ t an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term .
__label__noemo	Oh , no . He ’ s an executive for a large computer company . I saw an interview with him on TV yesterday . They were asking his opinion about future uses for computers .
__label__noemo	Very good .
__label__joy	That's good ! This is our first transaction . I hope you'll be entirely satisfied with this initial shipment .
__label__noemo	Fine , just fine.And you ?
__label__noemo	That's good .
__label__noemo	I agree . I like his brother Paul . They are not alike .
__label__joy	OK , sir . We are looking forward to your arrival .
__label__noemo	What do you want to do next time ?
__label__noemo	What are in this folder ?
__label__noemo	Good morning Mike !
__label__noemo	I have a master's degree in HR management in Peking University . And I worked as a HR manager in a European enterprise for many years . I know it is not just some clerical issues , but more social work with reason and patience .
__label__noemo	In my opinion , it has a broad prospect and it needs smart mind .
__label__noemo	All right . You need to have an interview with our manager , Mr . McBride . Let's go to his office .
__label__noemo	We heard you weren't feeling well , so we came to check on you .
__label__joy	Whoa , that ’ s a lot of cash ! Let ’ s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing .
__label__noemo	Thanks a lot .
__label__noemo	Now please tell me something about your achievements in your work unit .
__label__noemo	All right . I will get them for you .
__label__noemo	Could you tell me something about it ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m a bus driver .
__label__noemo	Oh , thank God . Thank you , I'll be right back .
__label__noemo	Good morning , Janice . Our office will hold a welcoming party in the evening , so I will allocate you some assignment .
__label__noemo	OK . I'll go and get a pair of them .
__label__noemo	Here is your change and your receipt.Do you have goods unpaid on you , sir
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__joy	My first grandchild .
__label__noemo	How often ?
__label__noemo	If you succeed in doing that , you must attend the interview on time .
__label__noemo	Won't that be expensive ?
__label__noemo	An acoustic one .
__label__noemo	Most people think so .
__label__noemo	I bet AC Milan will lose .
__label__noemo	why ? You mean a lot to me .
__label__noemo	Yep . She's always got a bun in the oven . She was pregnant before marriage-a real sin in the Catholic Church .
__label__noemo	Chen Liang , a table for four . And when are you coming ?
__label__noemo	I am currently working in a foreign company as a salesman .
__label__noemo	What do you think of the coming match ?
__label__noemo	Hmm , they look interesting . Can I have a copy of your brochure ?
__label__noemo	Here we are , Joan . This is the Palace museum , also known as the Forbidden city .
__label__noemo	I have some tablets for seasickness .
__label__joy	How about going to a concert ?
__label__noemo	I don't know why I cannot take a step forward .
__label__noemo	Well , to start with , Markweed Inc . has a reputation for being one of the best employers in the field .
__label__noemo	Just present your VISA card , and there won't be any problems .
__label__noemo	Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . Price yourself near the low end . Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . They think that is must be poor quality if it ’ s that cheap .
__label__noemo	It must be cold in the winter , though .
__label__noemo	When do you expect him back ?
__label__noemo	Sure . What are they ?
__label__noemo	do you think that I should get a new wardrobe ?
__label__noemo	First you make a list of what you wanna buy ...
__label__noemo	Sure . Does he know where to call you ?
__label__noemo	That's true . It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s ' generation .
__label__noemo	That's all right .
__label__surprise	He must be mad ! Nick is a loan shark .
__label__noemo	Mr . Brown , you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us . If we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices , we shall lose out .
__label__noemo	actually , I mostly just listen classical music . What about you ?
__label__noemo	Why did you move ?
__label__joy	I kind of know where you live , but could you e-mail me your address ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , what ’ s up ?
__label__noemo	Hello , I am going to the store to buy some fruit .
__label__noemo	Well , there are several reasons . I don't think my present job is suitable for me . That's the first reason . Secondly , your company has a good reputation . I think it can offer me more challenging opportunities . Last , frankly speaking , I wish to get higher pay .
__label__noemo	They're not cheap , but neither is their furniture .
__label__noemo	You should try swimming then . It helps you to keep fit .
__label__noemo	My name is Jerry and we are on the intersection of West Road and East Road .
__label__joy	Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ?
__label__noemo	Merry Christmas , Jina .
__label__noemo	On the meter ?
__label__noemo	They don ’ t pay a lot , do they ?
__label__noemo	If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final .
__label__noemo	I know it is not the cheapest on the market . But if you take the quality factor into consideration , you will find your company will benefit in the long term . This device is built in with the most advanced technology . Every aspect has reached the international standard . It is a worthwhile investment .
__label__noemo	Please sign your name here .
__label__noemo	How much is your last salary ?
__label__noemo	what about going on a picnic ?
__label__noemo	Because I love the snow .
__label__noemo	Is it ?
__label__noemo	Look at the cloud .
__label__anger	Put on a sweater ! I ’ m not gonna let you run up my heating bill just because it ’ s a bit chilly .
__label__noemo	After this dye job , it feels I look younger .
__label__noemo	Yes , may I know your name ?
__label__noemo	I'm not sure . What does it look like ?
__label__noemo	Why do you say that ?
__label__noemo	Yes , you need the traveler's check but you needn't get any foreign currency . You can have my US Dollars , I don't need them .
__label__noemo	Did you register yet ?
__label__noemo	Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	What sort of things do you grow in your garden ?
__label__noemo	It's in aisle A .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__noemo	That ’ s for sure . During the back court , we should change the position we played .
__label__noemo	Jewelry ?
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	All right .
__label__joy	My favorite , Mexican . And I've heard that the head chef is from San Paulo .
__label__noemo	Yes . An iguana is too strange for a gift , and a tie is too normal.So I have to find something halfway between .
__label__noemo	But journalism , it is a very different profession from administration.You know a lot about administration.Why don't you choose to work for a company looking for managers ?
__label__noemo	Hello . Can I ask what steps I have to go through in applying for the job ?
__label__noemo	It's Snow .
__label__noemo	When I turn off my home alarm , the house will automatically tum on the lights and set the climate to a comfortable level .
__label__noemo	What are you planning on cooking ?
__label__noemo	What should I do ?
__label__noemo	Here is the document you asked for this morning .
__label__joy	Not at all . It was a pleasure . Perhaps you will come out with us again while you are here .
__label__noemo	Hi , Mark ! Hi , do you have a minute ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I am . Actually my wife is a teacher .
__label__noemo	C :: Four by six will do .
__label__noemo	It'll be $ 308 nightly .
__label__noemo	First , we could spend 45 minutes working on your English writing.If you want , I could help you edit your papers.Or we could do English conversation . Whatever you want.And then the next 45 minutes you would help me with my Chinese .
__label__noemo	I picked up guitar at an early age , maybe around 8 years old . Afterward , I taught myself by listening to some records of top players .
__label__noemo	Hands , when one is not actually eating , may be in the lap . Tipping one's chair is unforgivable .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Let me see ... What's this , shrimp rolls ?
__label__noemo	So , how'd everyone do ?
__label__joy	Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will .
__label__noemo	Which stop do I get off on ?
__label__noemo	I'll look out for you about 2 tomorrow afternoon .
__label__noemo	The early bird gets the worm .
__label__noemo	There ’ s a lot of rain in summer . But it seldom rains in autumn
__label__noemo	Can't you delay your return a little bit ?
__label__noemo	I can't believe it . How can that be ? How old are you ?
__label__noemo	It looks like it , he ’ s getting up .
__label__joy	Gee , that's really nice of you .
__label__joy	That would be very nice . Only that I ’ ll be a little late . Is that OK ?
__label__joy	I like spring , too.We can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air .
__label__noemo	Ok , see you then , bye .
__label__noemo	Then , how about this one ?
__label__noemo	I will try my best . Here is the draft . Would you please go over it and see if any modifications are needed ?
__label__noemo	Haven ’ t you heard ? Richard was fired by our manager .
__label__noemo	This one looks pretty good , but I'd like to see more before I make up my mind . Do you have any other suggestions ?
__label__noemo	May I work in sales department ?
__label__noemo	Henry married Rose only after her father's money , didn't he ?
__label__noemo	We're sorry that this has happened , and I guarantee that the same mistake won't happen again .
__label__noemo	Not really , so long as you follow all the regulations .
__label__noemo	No , don't try to tend me . I'm becoming chubby , and I have to slender down .
__label__noemo	It's about time .
__label__noemo	What do you need help with ?
__label__noemo	I would like to meet on Monday .
__label__joy	Thank you , ma'am . Forty-three cents change . Have a nice day .
__label__noemo	Just keep track of everything and get it all back where you took it from by Sunday evening .
__label__joy	I was laughing through the whole movie .
__label__noemo	Do you want to try the new coffee here ?
__label__noemo	Let me see . En .. just a minute . Here it is . I need your signature on this note .
__label__noemo	$ 40 .
__label__noemo	Would you please put that cigarette out ? I get sick on it .
__label__noemo	Yes , but why should you want to do that ?
__label__fear	I ... I failed to pass the examination . How I wish I had studied hard .
__label__noemo	Room service , can I help you ?
__label__noemo	OK ... Do I need to put on my sister's name for the receiver ?
__label__joy	Thanks , but I speak English with a strong German accent .
__label__noemo	How are you doing ?
__label__noemo	We landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again .
__label__noemo	So , what happened ?
__label__noemo	Sorry , I can't go today .
__label__noemo	Some money has been sent from our Head Office in Berlin . Could you check whether you have received the remittance yet ?
__label__anger	I'm sick of doing other people's job and getting blamed for not doing it right .
__label__noemo	Ok . Well , we'll have a nurse take some blood in a few minutes to see if you're dehydrated . First , let me feel your pulse .
__label__noemo	Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
__label__sadness	Whatever am i going to tell me parents .
__label__noemo	Ok . I ’ Ve finished online . Let ’ s go . I ’ ll just get some money and my credit card .
__label__noemo	Now what about your experience ? How long have you been working with computers ?
__label__noemo	That's nothing new .
__label__joy	But it is lucky for us . The company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . I have shopped too often online these days .
__label__surprise	Really ? You don ’ t look very Chinese to me , if you don ’ t mind me saying so .
__label__noemo	We should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kebabs .
__label__joy	Bye .
__label__noemo	Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts . However , a few free k
__label__noemo	Can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a little ?
__label__noemo	I ’ ll make a deal with you . We ’ ll leave it up until Sunday , and then we ’ ll take it down after church .
__label__noemo	there are 15 chapters in total .
__label__noemo	I feel exactly the same way as you .
__label__noemo	What do you mean ?
__label__surprise	Really ? When did you decide this ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I did .
__label__noemo	No , the gym is free to guests . Take your room key , however , so you can get in .
__label__noemo	OK . Here you are . If there are no questions , could we have your signature in the blank below ?
__label__noemo	I need it delivered tomorrow . Will that be possible ?
__label__noemo	Hello everyone , and welcome to our CPR for beginners course.First of all , does anyone know what CPR stands for ?
__label__noemo	Yes.please .
__label__noemo	I see . That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !
__label__noemo	I think you'll be very pleased with how well we duplicate your old card .
__label__noemo	You need to fill out this form , please .
__label__noemo	Do you have desserts ?
__label__noemo	I envy you , Mr Meng ! What can I do for you today ?
__label__noemo	Lucky number . Find its location now .
__label__noemo	He looks strong.What does he do ?
__label__surprise	Why ?
__label__noemo	Thanks for reminding me . I had forgotten to get mine .
__label__noemo	That's the one .
__label__noemo	They took advantage of the blackout .
__label__noemo	You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere ? Well , it's the same thing .
__label__noemo	Which season do you like best ?
__label__noemo	Have you anything to declare ?
__label__noemo	You have to have your ticket checked .
__label__noemo	Have a pleasant stay in Britain .
__label__noemo	Where to , sir ?
__label__noemo	So , do you want to go somewhere for dinner and practice our English together tonight ?
__label__noemo	They would also like to have a meeting with our designers . And this time , their visit to our company will lay the basement for our cooperation , so you need to pay more attention .
__label__sadness	Whatever am i going to tell me parents .
__label__noemo	Sorry Paul . I couldn't help it . So why doesn't he give you a hand ?
__label__joy	You are more beautiful than the roses .
__label__noemo	Well , in that case . I will call the manger , you can talk directly with him .
__label__noemo	Oh , that's too bad .
__label__noemo	I ’ d rather you stayed in the office and did these things .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	she also believes in healthy diet . And she requires us to have regular meals .
__label__noemo	The library is next to the Adminstration Building . The Adminstration Building is over there near the school ’ s main entrance . There are school maps for free in the lobby of the Admin .
__label__disgust	And the plot is so simple .
__label__noemo	Good , I ' Ve get a two-pin plug .
__label__noemo	Sure , madam . Only one dollar .
__label__noemo	I see . How is it paid ? I mean , what payment methods are possible ?
__label__noemo	Are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ?
__label__noemo	How ?
__label__noemo	No , I can ’ t let you have it for 12.How about 14 ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to have Chinese food .
__label__joy	I started with game show this morning , I really enjoy them , and even answered the most of questions correctly .
__label__noemo	I don't know . I just need to try it once . I'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight .
__label__noemo	Yeah , maybe you ’ re right . How about this outfit ?
__label__noemo	What's the matter with me , Doctor ? I feel so tired these days .
__label__noemo	Yes , but they do it differently . Everything is different .
__label__noemo	Certainly .
__label__noemo	That black sheep . It serves him right .
__label__joy	I'm glad to meet you , Mr . Zhuang . Sit down , please .
__label__noemo	I had spaghetti with clam sauce for lunch .
__label__noemo	Hello , Dana , this is Kevin Abrahams from Eureka Corp . I don't know if you'll remember me but we met last week at the Chamber of Commerce luncheon .
__label__noemo	OK . What are the biggest cities ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I'm still working there . But I really find my job boring . I'd like to change my job .
__label__noemo	Will you please put your luggage on the scale ?
__label__noemo	When did you last time have your eyes checked ?
__label__joy	Good-bye !
__label__noemo	I can help you with that . Do you still have your receipt ?
__label__surprise	what a shame ! Didn't he realized that ?
__label__joy	Yes , let's do it .
__label__noemo	Why is that ?
__label__noemo	All right . I suggest posting the ad Monday through Friday .
__label__noemo	Oh , thank you . Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	They must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood .
__label__noemo	I am sorry , but I can't stay until the end of class .
__label__noemo	Could you tell me what university you went to , Mr . Smith ?
__label__noemo	Let me write it down on a piece of paper for you . You can show to the taxi driver .
__label__noemo	Ah , well , we have no choice .
__label__noemo	I really hope that your company could provide living places ; otherwise I have to rent a house to live .
__label__noemo	Ten days ago .
__label__noemo	About 50 miles .
__label__joy	That sounds like a good deal .
__label__noemo	But there isn't a single one right now .
__label__noemo	This blouse is a special offer today . You can have it at 10 % off the regular price .
__label__noemo	You're welcome .
__label__noemo	Jane , I ’ m on the other line , can you hang on for a second ?
__label__noemo	Perhaps it ’ s in your other pocket .
__label__noemo	Yes , sir .
__label__noemo	But what do most people think about it ?
__label__noemo	We have a double room for you with a nice view of the park . Would that be OK ?
__label__noemo	Mom , can we get cable TV or a satellite dish ?
__label__noemo	Run around the track . In the morning I run for an hour , and in the afternoon I run around the building .
__label__noemo	I ' Ve beaning worked IBM for years . I am vested personnel file system , He is the after sale survise director . he such a nice boss , I like working for him .
__label__joy	That ’ s a good idea ! The kitchen will look amazing !
__label__noemo	It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather .
__label__joy	Wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . I really like it . That is so nice of you .
__label__joy	You are our honored guests .
__label__noemo	What are you thinking about ?
__label__noemo	I still think we should have a realtor.We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house.And also , the realtor will inspect the house.He can tell us if the house has
__label__noemo	Paul , you were also a parent of young kids before . So , can you tell me what you did when your kids didn ’ t behave very well ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it is .
__label__noemo	Is there a daily passenger ship to Dalian ?
__label__noemo	The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me .
__label__noemo	So ?
__label__noemo	It's 3 nights a week , Monday , Tuesday and Thursday .
__label__joy	Yes . And what dances do you like best ?
__label__anger	I don't want to sit there and watch them torturing the animals .
__label__noemo	Do you mean financially rewarding ?
__label__noemo	Not really . I'm expected to attend a meeting .
__label__noemo	I want to get in touch with the Chinese Embassy , because my passport was in the stolen bag !

__label__joy	Oh , it's really fabulous . I wanna take a picture here .
__label__joy	Thanks . Could you tell me where I should deposit my bag ?

__label__joy	Wow ! Congratulations !
__label__noemo	No , the meeting will be held on the fourth floor .
__label__noemo	What's the rate for a station wagon ?
__label__noemo	I'd suggest that you go to the Philately Store in Nanjing Road East , where the items are authentic and the prices are reasonable .
__label__noemo	Working under pressure is exciting and challenging . I don ’ t mind . In fact , I am very efficient when certain pressure is exerted on the work .
__label__noemo	I think it's a great idea . Studying abroad will offer you plenty of new opportunities . Are you planning on going abroad ?
__label__noemo	No , that ’ s not all your fault .
__label__noemo	We hope so .
__label__noemo	Would you mail this letter for me when you go to the post office ?
__label__noemo	My daughter . She is missing . I don ’ t know where she is .
__label__noemo	Yes , I want to send a registered airmail letter to France .
__label__noemo	You mean fat boy ?
__label__noemo	Hello . I'm now trying to take a bath , but there are too many buttons.Would you tell me how to use them ?
__label__joy	Very comfortable . I'll take them .
__label__noemo	Is it easy to get lost ?
__label__noemo	Let me see ... Wednesday morning . Yes , I am booked solid all morning . What ’ s up ?
__label__noemo	Yes , you're right . Politicians of all kinds , religious people , and one or two madmen .

__label__joy	My granny is such a kind-hearted person . She is willing to help .
__label__noemo	Oh , I know . She is a famous woman and a focus of the newspaper now because of this thing .
__label__noemo	Oh , Mike . How are you doing ?
__label__noemo	Richard ! I need those tax forms from you before five !
__label__noemo	( still on the bus . ) What time is it ?
__label__noemo	Not right now . I've got to get another car and my old one is blown up .
__label__sadness	Unfortunately , I missed a chance to see a classic movie .
__label__joy	That's great !
__label__noemo	How about Friday afternoon ?
__label__noemo	Are there any good programs on TV ?
__label__noemo	I think one of the least costly ways to attract business is to ask some of our neighboring sites to offer links to our page inside of theirs . If they have related services , they may be willing to help us out .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__noemo	I need to find a bus that'll take me to the Gold Line .
__label__noemo	I came in to see how my home inspection went .
__label__noemo	I know what I am doing . Don't worry . Can you do me a favor ?

__label__noemo	How did it grow into such a large place ?
__label__joy	Um — I was just thinking aloud .
__label__noemo	I said Merry Christmas ! Don ’ t you know that Christmas is almost here ?
__label__noemo	Could you tell me which kind of payment you'll choose ?
__label__noemo	Mainly plastics . Plastics aren ’ t bio degradable - they don ’ t break down easily in the environment - so they shouldn't be thrown away .
__label__noemo	That's true . I guess we ’ ll have to keep looking for a manager then .
__label__noemo	That will be 80 Yuan altogether . Here is your invoice .
__label__noemo	Probably on the of the cabinet . I'll go and get it .
__label__noemo	Yeah ! Do all these people work in the company ? Everyone and their dog is here !
__label__joy	I like that . Then the adults will be more free to mingle and relax .
__label__noemo	Hello , madam . How do you like your staying here ?
__label__noemo	Escrow involves a lot of paperwork , but I will explain all of the steps to you as we go along .
__label__noemo	Good morning , Jerry . How's everything ?
__label__noemo	Wait a minute ! Just hold your horses ! What's your hurry , anyway ?
__label__noemo	What are you studying ?
__label__noemo	If you are really in love with your wife , you should be in support of her . You can ’ t have it both ways , of course .
__label__noemo	John , do you have a minute ?
__label__noemo	yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ...
__label__noemo	Sure , here you are .
__label__noemo	Were I in your position , I'd go to America .
__label__noemo	How are you making out these days ?
__label__noemo	No , there aren ’ t . this map just show the geographical features . Look at the Himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world .
__label__noemo	You will visit the Hyde Park , Poet's Corner , Tower of London , Fleet Street and Tower Bridge .
__label__noemo	I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things . Most importantly , I practice every chance I get .
__label__noemo	The time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__noemo	Chicago University . My major is Economics .
__label__joy	Hope the restaurant is still there .
__label__noemo	When could we meet to discuss the project ?
__label__noemo	Good afternoon , ABC Incorporated . How many I direct your call ?
__label__noemo	Must he stay in bed ?
__label__joy	I ’ m glad you ’ re enjoying it .
__label__noemo	oh my , no internet access is killing me .
__label__noemo	Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The tow just don ’ t go together .
__label__noemo	What about the registration procedure ? Is that complicated ?
__label__noemo	Not at all . I don't know what's dutiable . Do I have to pay duty on things for my own use ?
__label__noemo	Um ?
__label__disgust	I hate computer games .
__label__noemo	There was a serious disturbance in the street this morning .
__label__noemo	Size five .
__label__noemo	I'm ok . I wish I could say the same for my friend .
__label__noemo	What are you saying ? You are acting weird today .
__label__noemo	I won't say who , because I'm not sure yet . But I'll know soon .
__label__noemo	I like doughnuts .
__label__noemo	But I am not that someone . I can easily talk him into doing whatever I want him to do .
__label__noemo	I hated the hand-me-downs to wear when I was a kid .
__label__noemo	Here you are , sir . You're all set . I hope you enjoyed your stay . And that next time you're in town , you will stay with us again .
__label__noemo	Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow in here ?
__label__joy	An art ! You have a good point there . So it is called martial arts in English . The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely . They even made fighting a great enjoyment , so marvelous and fascinating .
__label__noemo	What useful treatment can you offer ?
__label__noemo	Does this job require that new employees take any kind of training course ?
__label__noemo	True . I would like to have some salmon sashimi and a roast salmon head .
__label__noemo	That ’ ll do.Bring the most recent one in with your completed application , and we ’ ll issue you a temporary library card right away .
__label__noemo	You owe $ 235.13 .
__label__noemo	Is my VCR ready ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me , you look lost . Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Small , but it should be enough for our needs . I think .
__label__noemo	I have got a computer engineer's qualification certificate .
__label__noemo	The final examination will be held at the end of this month . Have you made good preparation ?
__label__noemo	I work in a cubicle too , but I I don ’ t mind it .
__label__noemo	Well , it's a fruit with a big seed in it .
__label__noemo	The teacher asked me to make a speech in English class and I wasn't prepared . He punished me by making me stand in front of the whole class . It was so embarrassing .
__label__noemo	I think I ’ m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions .
__label__noemo	A little . Are you American ?
__label__noemo	Maybe you are right .
__label__noemo	Hey Ted , I saw this ad in the paper . You should take a look .
__label__noemo	I think my arm is broken .
__label__noemo	When you worked in your previous company , which did you prefer , working with other people or by yourself ?
__label__joy	I see them ! Wow ! How do you know they're wild ?
__label__noemo	Either way . I don ’ t care .
__label__noemo	well , I wanted to let you know that I've put in my notice .
__label__noemo	That's easy . Everyone knows that there are nine .
__label__noemo	No wonder I haven ’ t seen you recently . Where did you spend your holidays ?
__label__noemo	We call this a ' parking meter ' .
__label__noemo	What does the company mainly do ?
__label__noemo	I don't want to put you on the spot . Here's what I'm getting at , I don't think Vincent is the man for the job .
__label__noemo	How do I tell the difference between a ripe one and an unripe one ?
__label__noemo	it seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ?
__label__joy	That's neat !
__label__noemo	I have no idea . First time here .
__label__sadness	Sorry , I ’ m looking for my wallet .
__label__noemo	Very affordable sir . You can take it out of this lot today with 0 % down payment and no interest for the first year ! You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .
__label__joy	Yes , I think that rice will go perfectly with my chicken !
__label__noemo	What are you majoring in ?
__label__noemo	Hey , look at the offer I got in my e-mail . It says that I can get rich quickly while working at home !
__label__noemo	OK , sir . Here you are . There is a one-year warranty .
__label__noemo	Let ’ s play a game !
__label__noemo	No . Only a little . I fell off my porch .
__label__noemo	So what ?
__label__noemo	It is such a nice place .
__label__noemo	Oh , certainly .
__label__noemo	Please make a single-breasted .
__label__noemo	It's not just about the things that you learn , you know ... seminars are a really great opportunity to mingle and network with professionals in our industry from all over the nation . You can learn a few things , but more importantly , you rub shoulders with the business leaders and make contacts that could lead to potential sales or partnerships in the future . The social mixers are always more important than the seminars anyway .
__label__noemo	Is it very cold in winter there ?
__label__joy	Thank you so much for shopping here . Here's your change and receipt .
__label__noemo	David , recently I established a travelling forum , and now I want to make a plan to hold the first activity . Where can we go for this time ?
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__noemo	3725015281 ?
__label__noemo	Are you ready to move ?
__label__noemo	You will need to pay late fees on these books .
__label__noemo	Is there anything that you ’ Ve done to your tooth that might have caused the pain ?
__label__joy	I see . Thanks a lot .
__label__noemo	that's a very difficult language to learn , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	How about my backpack ? Do you know where that is ?
__label__noemo	And the problem is , sir ?
__label__joy	Smells good ! What ’ s for breakfast ?
__label__noemo	You see . I've lost my weight in spite of my good appetite .
__label__noemo	Hi , Monica , I am afraid I can ’ t make it to the office to punch out .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Excuse me .
__label__noemo	Come in , please .
__label__noemo	I have tried . But Americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much .
__label__noemo	He said I ' d got the flu .
__label__noemo	All of the extensions are listed on the wall chart over there if you ever need help .
__label__noemo	If I were him , I would give him a good talking-to . I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that .
__label__noemo	So , Emily , how was your day ?
__label__noemo	Like what ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I can , but not very well .
__label__noemo	Beijing International Airport . Would you please help me with my baggage ?
__label__noemo	Mary , why don't you come to my house this Saturday ?
__label__noemo	Well , all the gifts for my family , you know , two pairs of sneakers for my children and a bottle of perfume for my wife .
__label__noemo	My son came home from three years in the navy .
__label__noemo	Well , what I can tell you is this . We've got an excellent record on making deliveries to our customers . Besides , all our cartons are lined with shockproof cardboards and are wrapped up with polyethylene sheets . So they're not only shockproof but also dampproof .
__label__joy	Thank you . The change , sir .
__label__surprise	Really ? I was quite good at the hurdles and the discus .
__label__noemo	Because of work , I can only go look at houses on the weekend .
__label__noemo	Any other benefits ?
__label__noemo	Let's see . You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles .
__label__disgust	Can you take he away from me ?
__label__noemo	I was thinking of taking off from September first until the thirtieth . Would you be okay with that ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected .
__label__noemo	Well , I may have stayed on the phone too long . Can you give me her number ? I'll call her later .
__label__noemo	just today . I guess I forgot to mention it .
__label__joy	Wow ! I ’ m very excited about your ceremony .
__label__noemo	Was it a very old house ?
__label__noemo	I saw a lot of teenagers when Alan and I were there yesterday .
__label__noemo	It ’ s a thriller . It has Julia Roberts playing the female lead .
__label__noemo	I pay much attention to my daily diet . You know good eating habits help to fortify the body against disease .
__label__noemo	Cool . What will they think of next ? How much are they ?
__label__noemo	25.00 dollars a week , but you can't have visitors .
__label__noemo	Mark , you are not telling me the truth . Now why ?
__label__noemo	Do you know what you want to drink ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s our latest development . A product with high performance . We put it on the market just two months ago .
__label__noemo	I think it's OK . I also have two credit cards .
__label__noemo	But she means to help you , not to trouble you .
__label__noemo	What would you do if you were in my shoes ?
__label__noemo	Do you get along with your parents now ?
__label__noemo	I am not picky on food . Just bring me the day menu .
__label__noemo	I haven't danced for a long time .
__label__joy	Oh , we ’ d like the buffet please . We ’ Ve heard it ’ s very good .
__label__noemo	Maybe they don ’ t agree with my taste .
__label__noemo	Let me show you.We have this rose color . We also have different shades of beige .
__label__noemo	Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ?
__label__noemo	Yes . Why ?
__label__noemo	I got it .
__label__surprise	Wow , that's unbelievable ! You play so well , but you've never been to a real teacher . You will definitely be famous in the near future .
__label__noemo	It's fun walking around them , but their displays are so good I'm tempted to buy things I don't really need .
__label__noemo	Have you exercised strenuously or played sports recently ?
__label__noemo	Where were you last night , at exactly nine twenty PM ?
__label__noemo	No problem . Please fill in this transfer form that will authorise us to send the amount from the Securities Company to your account .
__label__noemo	Is that true ?
__label__noemo	Our neighbour ’ s tape recorder is so loud that it annoys us to death . I ’ Ve made up my mind to cut the electricity off .
__label__joy	It's pretty . Can I try it on ?
__label__noemo	The starting monthly salary would be ¥ 2,000 , with rises after the half year according to your competence .
__label__joy	Yes , thanks .
__label__noemo	Irene ! I heard you were on a date last night ! So , how how did it go ? I want all the juicy details !
__label__noemo	Oh . Who is the artist ?
__label__noemo	Love Music Woman
__label__joy	That's my boyfriend Matt . Isn't he cute ?
__label__noemo	My husband said he had a credit card . Do you accept credit card ?

__label__joy	Lunch sounds great ! Let's head on out !
__label__joy	How fine the needlework is ! What's the price ?
__label__noemo	We can do that , but you'll have to pay a little extra .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I agree.Every wall has two sides .
__label__noemo	I want sharing Company .
__label__joy	Enjoy yourself .
__label__noemo	by the way , how long does it take ?
__label__noemo	By telephone and in my name .
__label__noemo	I lost track of time , am I late ?
__label__noemo	That's something else ! Maybe I'll return it to them .
__label__surprise	Really ? I don't agree . This Star Wars episode was incredible !
__label__joy	No . Don't be silly . I wouldn't dream of letting you do that .
__label__noemo	Your niece will love this . Anything else ?
__label__noemo	But that way you're not savoring it .
__label__noemo	No .
__label__joy	Right .
__label__noemo	There's a petite section that you an check out .
__label__noemo	Have you gotten your learner's permit ?
__label__joy	Oh ... that makes me excited too !

__label__noemo	Oh ! I just want to drop in on him for a chat .
__label__noemo	I had to carry my backpack with me all day .
__label__noemo	We usually set up a direct debit system taking installments directly from your bank account on a monthly basis . And since you are already a valued customer , there should be no trouble in processing you application for this loan .
__label__noemo	When there is a computer available , I will call you .
__label__noemo	That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways .
__label__noemo	Ok I ’ Ve found it . Checking out on the 27th ?
__label__noemo	Here's the restaurant we're meeting the Smiths at .
__label__joy	Thank you , and have a nice day .

__label__noemo	It is serious .
__label__noemo	Could you help me ?
__label__noemo	Ladies and gentlemen . It's about time to land in New York . Here are a couple of forms for you to fill out .
__label__noemo	After the owners get home from work tonight , I will approach them with your offer .
__label__noemo	Lily , do you know Lizzy ?
__label__noemo	sure , I ’ ll just go put the kettle on . Why don ’ t you have a seat on the sofa and I ’ ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
__label__noemo	Is there anything I can do for you ?
__label__noemo	Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ?
__label__noemo	It's a bad idea . Vicky has short hair .
__label__noemo	No thanks . I want to have a refund .
__label__noemo	Yes . It's a prototype of our new product . It has got more advantages than the second did .
__label__noemo	Why don ’ t you recommend one to me ?
__label__noemo	Yes . It is very important to me . My mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . I have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and I know that t
__label__noemo	Straight ahead to the traffic lights , left and then right .
__label__joy	That's great . Thank you so much .
__label__noemo	It's a big bedroom with a drawing room , facing a beautiful wood .
__label__noemo	I want to take out some money , but there's a massive queue for the ATM so I thought I'd do it over the counter .
__label__joy	It's a cute little teddy bear !
__label__noemo	It's made in China .
__label__noemo	Hello , this is Julie from Google Corp . Is that Jin Lili ?
__label__noemo	she looked sweeter than her pictures .
__label__noemo	What type of movies do you like ?
__label__anger	But she lied to me .
__label__noemo	Good morning .
__label__noemo	Yes , I have .
__label__noemo	Have you had a chance to look over the contract ?
__label__noemo	I almost always make either a beef roast or a chicken roast with asparagus , parsnips , peas , carrots and potatoes on Sundays .
__label__joy	We are always happy to adjust our cooking to meet your needs .
__label__anger	I am fed up with Jack . He is so weak in dealing with other people and always eats dirt .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__noemo	Okay . Do you have a special location in mind ?
__label__noemo	I wonder if you often trade with others on the internet .
__label__joy	Oh , fresh juice , I love it . Well , I heard American people love hanging out in bars . Is that true ?
__label__noemo	I'm getting so paunchy that I'm afraid I have to buy a new belt to-morrow , and I think I must go on a diet .
__label__sadness	But Anne ...
__label__noemo	Oh ... why ?
__label__noemo	Sure . It's an issue asking for everyone's participation .
__label__surprise	What ? Are you serious ? Oh , my gosh ! There will be guys everywhere .
__label__joy	Yeah , I am very impressed with Tom Hanks ' performance in the movie .
__label__noemo	Yes , that's right . Extension 162 .

__label__noemo	I'll call you .
__label__noemo	Hello . Is everything OK ? Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	I just dropped in to say goodbye .
__label__noemo	Sorry , I've got a meeting in half an hour .

__label__surprise	An Ethiopian restaurant ? Whoa ! I always think of starving people in Ethiopia .
__label__noemo	At 8
__label__noemo	You have no choice , so you'd better adjust your thoughts to be ready to learn anything at any time .
__label__noemo	What size house would you like ?
__label__noemo	To be honest , it looks like your old carpet . Is it really new or did you just have your old cleaned ?
__label__joy	You're welcome , and I apologize for the inconvenience .
__label__anger	But that is terrible ! I am only here for one night !
__label__joy	Okay . I ’ ll take it . Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	Joe , how are you doing ?
__label__noemo	So you're traveling around the world , aren't you .
__label__noemo	I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day .
__label__noemo	Oh . Take it easy . As I ’ Ve said in the interview , once you are employed , we ’ ll give you a probation period of three months . And now we need to sign a draft agreement for the probation period .
__label__noemo	And please let white color dominate .
__label__noemo	She takes classes in accounting and business .
__label__noemo	We ’ re having a Valentine ’ s Day Party .
__label__noemo	I don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
__label__surprise	You've got to be joking .
__label__noemo	I need some US Dollars .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__noemo	Yes . Since I entered college , I have been working at a fast food restaurant as a part-time waitress .
__label__joy	( A moment later ) It's cute.The color suits my complexion .
__label__joy	Oh , it ’ s lovely . Think of the nasty weather we had last week .
__label__joy	I think that the company retreat should be in the mountains this year .
__label__noemo	Yes , that is big enough , but it's too heavy for me .
__label__noemo	Ok kids , here ’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee , a pail and a shovel . I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . Don ’ t stray too far . Wait ! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes
__label__noemo	Well ! You like sea food ?
__label__noemo	Just like the pattern dragon , right ?
__label__noemo	Then , we ’ Ve got plenty of time .
__label__noemo	Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month .
__label__noemo	Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ’ s . most mp ’ s vote the way their party wants them to .
__label__joy	Who is the best man ?
__label__noemo	Take me to this address , please .
__label__joy	You know those upstarts . They're all show-offs ! I think I'd better have a diet ; otherwise I'd look like a ballon soon .
__label__noemo	I'll have my brother cut some for you .
__label__noemo	That ’ s going to take a while to put together , Paul .
__label__noemo	I have two kids . A boy and a girl .
__label__noemo	I ’ m afraid you ’ ll become angry . But I think I must tell you .
__label__fear	Let me have a look . Whoa ! Get away from me !
__label__noemo	I believe there ’ s a sitcom .
__label__noemo	No , not at all . Go ahead .
__label__noemo	I suppose there's nothing cheaper , is there ?
__label__noemo	You mustn't go to bed very late . Can you be home before nine .
__label__noemo	Hey , Zina . You're here early today .
__label__noemo	Yes , sir . I'll bring it over . Have you decided what you'd like , sir ?
__label__noemo	Why not ? They are very fun and exiting .
__label__noemo	No , but I have taken elective courses in computer in college .
__label__noemo	So the company decided to cancel your trip to Hong Kong ?
__label__anger	Oh , honey ! Don ’ t you remember this important day to us ?
__label__noemo	Wow , that sounds great ! Where are you going ?
__label__noemo	Sure ! What ' s playing ?
__label__noemo	Great . I have the banquet room reserved for a lunch on for Nika Corporation on the 2nd of December . May I have your name and contact information ?
__label__joy	After the trouble I got into last year , no way .
__label__noemo	When and where did you obtain your degree ?
__label__noemo	You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs . So we are taking you into custody .
__label__noemo	I use short messages quite a lot . If it's not too complicated I will send a short message , which can save much phone charge .
__label__joy	Bye bye ! Have a pleasant journey !
__label__joy	That's really my pleasure to listen to a Chinese song .
__label__noemo	Very good . Do you have anything to declare ?
__label__noemo	Good morning ! Is Mr . Smith in ? I'm Cheng Jun from China National Petroleum Corporation . I'd like to see him .
__label__noemo	I wonder which looks more lustrous .
__label__joy	Thank you !
__label__joy	It's interesting , I like being an editor .
__label__noemo	Yeah . You don't need to rub it in .
__label__noemo	No , I don't think we have .
__label__surprise	You've been through this too ?
__label__joy	Yes , it is , isn't it ? A bit too light , really . What make have you got ?
__label__noemo	That's right , there's ' revocable ' and ' irrevocable ' . We usually go for the irrevocable one , it's the most popular .
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__noemo	A few months .
__label__noemo	In that case , I would suggest our own hotel restaurant . The chef , the food , and the service are outstanding .
__label__noemo	And for the Savings Deposit ?
__label__noemo	I bought it here three days ago .
__label__noemo	Yes , that ’ s right , you have the job now .
__label__noemo	I lived in England when I was a child .
__label__noemo	to be honest with you , Jason , I don't think I'm doing a very good job of balancing my schoolwork with my job . I'm always two steps behind . I've got to get back to the dorm and continue writing tha
__label__noemo	I think it ’ s important to most people . The problem is that you can usually only find out if someone is honest by getting to know them .
__label__noemo	OK . I like that green vegetable but I don't know how to call it .
__label__noemo	I see , D . But I plead you to help her .
__label__joy	I want to try something different today .
__label__noemo	What are you talking about ? It wasn ’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family !
__label__noemo	Well , in a way yes . But I must say that even if I ’ m not completely happy in my work I always give 110 % I would never shirk my responsibilities . I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon .
__label__noemo	Fine , Mr . Grant . Thanks for your time . I ’ ll talk to you next week .
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? That sounds interesting , what kinds of book do you publish ?
__label__noemo	I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .
__label__noemo	Someone declared that he saw it .
__label__anger	Curse this oven ! Curse it !
__label__joy	This is exciting ! Thank you so much !
__label__noemo	The work is rather hard , but it's interesting .
__label__noemo	Most of the time I'll be on a tour , enjoying the beautiful scenery there .
__label__noemo	The movies .
__label__noemo	Yes , you can take your letters to the counter over there .
__label__anger	Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
__label__noemo	We talked to our older brothers and sisters last night and got the scoop on what that job is all about .
__label__noemo	What else do I have to do ?
__label__joy	The right opportunity for you would come along soon . You know , music is transnational .
__label__noemo	Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place one machine instead of three .
__label__joy	Fantastic ! I guess the same is true with the arms , right ?
__label__joy	Get out of my way ! This is just like playing video games !
__label__noemo	Thanks .
__label__noemo	Can I reserve a room from the 13th to the 18th ?
__label__joy	I would like my margarita with no salt , thank you .
__label__noemo	Do you need anything , grocery ?
__label__joy	Yes , next March .
__label__fear	Well in the meantime you are a biohazard ! I didn ’ t get it when I was a kid and I ’ Ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult !
__label__noemo	Why don't you go sightseeing ?
__label__noemo	Oh , yes . The green dress is very smart . but I can't be sure if it goes with a hat .
__label__noemo	Is there the correct billing address ?
__label__sadness	Well , you always say you're busy .
__label__noemo	Sure I can , my treat .
__label__noemo	Mike ! What's going on , man ! Long time no see !
__label__noemo	Yeah , but grease and flour it first so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes .
__label__anger	Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops .
__label__noemo	One of my students told me she was very depressed today .
__label__noemo	Ok , thank you . By the way , could you please tell me how I can get there from A community ?
__label__noemo	That's OK . I will eat my eggs and bacon , and you can take my pancakes back .
__label__noemo	The party starts at 8 .
__label__noemo	Yes , I think so .
__label__noemo	But you're busy , aren't you ?
__label__noemo	I stayed in L . A . and it was sunny the entire weekend . We spent most of the time at home but we did go see King Kong on Christmas day .
__label__noemo	The owner said that the roof had leaked , but that he got it fixed last month .
__label__noemo	Doctor Butcher .
__label__noemo	What is it ?
__label__noemo	As a newcomer , you are going to be responsible for some basic tasks first , including certain routine duties like answering the telephone and typing . Later , you will be assigned to the Sales Department .
__label__joy	Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ?
__label__noemo	Women are such dreamers .
__label__noemo	You think it ’ s better that he should be told ?
__label__noemo	It must have been stolen by the few thieves . I ’ ll get it back for you .
__label__noemo	What's the matter ?
__label__sadness	But Mom ! Today we ’ re playing football ! I love football !
__label__noemo	By the way , a cotton came off your shirt you gave me the day before yesterday .
__label__sadness	Hmm , I don't feel very comfortable .
__label__noemo	My brother has last year's Accord.And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . I really like that color . I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord .
__label__noemo	I see .
__label__noemo	I'm skeptical . Mars is made of rocks containing silicon , iron , and various minerals . It also has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide . It is so different from what we have on earth , you know .
__label__sadness	Sorry , I've got people coming over tomorrow night .
__label__noemo	Long time no see !
__label__noemo	I've got some bad news about the bike you lent me .
__label__joy	That ’ s a nice area too . It ’ ll be a good investment for you .
__label__noemo	So you should bring an umbrella often .
__label__noemo	Are you going with your friends ?
__label__noemo	This color is becoming to you , too .
__label__noemo	I talked to her for a while , but she ’ s really depressed . So , I made an appointment with the school counselor for her .
__label__noemo	So get prepared for everything .
__label__noemo	Check with somebody from the IT department . They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
__label__noemo	Dad , can I have a pet ? I did what you said and passed all of my exams .
__label__noemo	I see .
__label__noemo	Yes , I really want to know about the housing system in your company .
__label__noemo	Bonjour !
__label__noemo	What seems to be the problem ?
__label__noemo	What do I do to log on to the computer ?
__label__joy	We hope that our cooperation will continue .
__label__joy	It's our pleasure to do business with you . We'll let you have the offer next Wednesday at the latest .
__label__noemo	I thought you would be worried about it . So I rang Auckland last night . As you are our biggest customer , they agreed to ship the order on the first vessel available that will leave Auckland next month .
__label__noemo	how did your interview go ?
__label__joy	Hey , great set of wheels .
__label__noemo	Let me see ... it's $ 50 .
__label__noemo	Would you like someone to walk you over to the Student Health Center ?
__label__noemo	is this line for non-residents ?
__label__noemo	Are you sure that I can get there in time if we take the less heavy route ?
__label__noemo	Okay ...
__label__noemo	I don't mind really.Perhaps a job in a shop or a factory .
__label__noemo	Yes . Good for you .
__label__noemo	That ’ s the least amount you can have .
__label__noemo	Yes , I know that . So I want him to have a good VCR to use .
__label__noemo	Pretty good . The HR manager asked me the usual questions . Then he wondered why I had decided to leave my previous job .
__label__noemo	Okay , I'll take these two magazines and a copy of Today's Post .
__label__noemo	I hear Fred is a very good student in your class .
__label__noemo	Don't tell me it affects our flight .
__label__noemo	Oh , she's nice . How much is she ?
__label__noemo	I'm just a little tired .
__label__joy	Thanks very much . I'm sure I'll be back , so see you again soon . Bye !
__label__joy	Oh , you needn't do that .
__label__noemo	Does that mean you're going to take my advice ?
__label__noemo	Not really , so long as you follow all the regulations .
__label__joy	You'll love this ! I can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone .
__label__noemo	Wonderful . I ’ d like to know why you ’ re interested in this position at our paper .
__label__noemo	Do you think I'll forget to do it ?
__label__noemo	Never mind , I can teach you .
__label__noemo	And you think about her all the time ?
__label__noemo	Garage sale , what does that mean ?
__label__joy	Are you kidding me ? I bought a same one last week . It's surprising that there is something we both like . Well , what do you think of these ceramic cups ?
__label__noemo	Don ’ t touch that thermostat ! You don ’ t pay the bills around here !
__label__noemo	Hey , Frank . I heard you got a new job .
__label__noemo	Oh yeah ? Tell me then , smarty pants , how will you go about setting up your garden ?
__label__sadness	I didn't make the soccer team .
__label__noemo	I'm off to Barcelona for a week .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'd like to book a table for two this evening .
__label__noemo	I think chess is more reasonable . You see , each side has eight pawns , a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi . A true battle should be like that . Soldiers should outnumber the commanders .
__label__noemo	Yes . We ’ Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month .
__label__noemo	I ’ m having a problem .
__label__noemo	That's all right .
__label__noemo	Every so often , I do .
__label__noemo	I have to be there before 17 o'clock .
__label__surprise	Well , I bombed my econ final and ended up with a 1.7 .
__label__noemo	I have plenty of gas .
__label__joy	I like hot food , especially Sichuan cuisine .
__label__noemo	What color is her hair ?
__label__noemo	He was very distinguished , maybe a bit over-qualified .
__label__noemo	You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned .
__label__noemo	how can I get it , please ?
__label__noemo	Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum .
__label__disgust	The new computer software is driving me crazy ! I really need a break !
__label__noemo	What size do you want the prints ?
__label__noemo	What did I just say ?
__label__noemo	If you get sick , I'll return the favor .
__label__noemo	But what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ?
__label__noemo	I get it now .
__label__joy	It's sounds like fun .
__label__noemo	Hey , there's Leo . I wonder why he's walking arm in arm with that young woman .
__label__noemo	Would you tell us your name , please ?
__label__noemo	You are so thoughtful . Do you think our tent will be working well ?
__label__noemo	Those tow games are quite different . First , there ’ s the size of the teams . In football , a team has 11 players . In rugby there are 15 players on each team . The biggest difference is that in football , only the goalkeeper can use his hands . In rugby , the ball is usually carried forward by players , though kicking is permitted .
__label__noemo	Excuse me .
__label__anger	I know . But I just can't stand her butting in when I was trying to emphasize a point .
__label__noemo	You don't have to . This is your knob menu.Just tick off the items you want for breakfast . write down the time and hang it outside the door before you go to bed tonight .
__label__noemo	No . I ’ m a little worried about security . You never who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren ’ t you worry about that ?
__label__noemo	Well take your time . There are so many things to sell .
__label__noemo	What size are you ?
__label__noemo	What's on TV tonight ? Is there a football match ?
__label__noemo	I want to put my desk over there , but it's too heavy for me to move .
__label__noemo	Great . Rmm , when can I expect to hear from you ?
__label__noemo	how much are you looking to spend ?
__label__noemo	Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ?
__label__noemo	it ’ ll be an expensive present , but we can share the cost .
__label__noemo	Pardon me . Could you help me ?
__label__noemo	Maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done .
__label__noemo	Yes , is there a problem ? Ma ’ am ?
__label__noemo	Until what ? What happened ? Did you see it clearly ? Did it attack you ?
__label__noemo	"These drawers contain cards describing every book in our library . Together they constitute the library's "" card catalog "" . You can see that each drawer runs from one part of the alphabet to another . Fox example , this drawer goes from SCA to SCM ."
__label__noemo	Make sure that your customs forms are with you .
__label__noemo	I ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . But can ’ t you try to get used to Western food ?
__label__joy	This is gonna be a great barbecue !
__label__sadness	I ’ m pretty tired . I haven ’ t been sleeping well .
__label__surprise	Science ? What are you talking about ? Forget about your science , OK ? It's a picnic !
__label__noemo	O . K . , thanks , doctor .
__label__anger	I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode .
__label__noemo	She kept on bothering me .
__label__noemo	Yes , but I don't know much about it .
__label__noemo	Do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space ?
__label__noemo	We will transfer your bag to the Lobby Floor Cloakroom . You may collect it there , madam .
__label__noemo	Well , I have a lot of experience in this area . I have all the qualifications you need . I enjoy working with people . In my current job , I ’ m in charge of a team of eight people .
__label__noemo	That's because I went to school for each class when I was at school . So now I am much more clever than you .
__label__surprise	Really ? How do you know that ?
__label__noemo	How long do you plan to stay here ?
__label__sadness	My colleagues quickly get promotions , while I always get sidelined . I don't know what to do anymore .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'd like five croissants , too .
__label__noemo	But he seems to be very happy with Rose .
__label__noemo	It seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map .
__label__noemo	Have a seat please while I call .
__label__noemo	I came two years ago after I graduated from college . This is my first job .
__label__noemo	Do you plan to pursue further education ?
__label__joy	See you then .
__label__joy	Good for you !
__label__surprise	What ? ! Isn't there a law against that , I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . You should know your rights ! If you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation .
__label__joy	Well , I've got to go . See you later .
__label__noemo	right . Then we turn left and walk up this small hill . The view from the top of the hill is worth the climb . We can eat a snack there .
__label__noemo	I had it when I left the house . I had it when we start to get the hotdog .
__label__noemo	Yes , I need this prescription please .
__label__noemo	15th of April , 1969 .
__label__noemo	I'd like to see the menu , please .
__label__noemo	I'm from New York . Oh , this is my stop . Bye , Robin .
__label__noemo	Yes . All the bidders will be invited to join us to supervise the tender-opening .
__label__noemo	Where to , madam ?
__label__noemo	Well , will you offer me any reduction since it's a out-of-season tour ?
__label__noemo	Mary didn't pass the final exam in physics .
__label__joy	Do you really ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry . The application for this position has closed .
__label__noemo	let me put it this way . I've never seen a professional sorts game in a stadium because I could never get myself to walk to the top of the stairs to sit down .
__label__noemo	I am sure we will .
__label__noemo	That's okay , I'll just check back later . Do you have the new Sting album ?
__label__joy	Quite good . The beautiful design and bright color are just the European taste . How are you gonna pack these blouses ?
__label__noemo	I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark . She then asked if I was his sister , and I said no , I was his wife . She hung up immediately .
__label__noemo	This can't be the right stop .
__label__noemo	Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop .
__label__noemo	do you want to go out for dinner tonight ?
__label__noemo	Okay , what time is my meeting in London ?
__label__joy	Do you want to go see a movie ?
__label__joy	Oh , you're welcome .
__label__noemo	I don't know . I feel like going out .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t know anything for certain . We always do a double check if there is a question .
__label__noemo	Yes , but I only have few experiences . I guided a few groups of foreign tourists from America last winter vacation . I showed them around some places of interest .
__label__noemo	What else do we need ?
__label__noemo	About 40 percent , if he speaks slowly.When he speaks fast , I can only catch a word here and there . But Mr . Wang is an excellent Chinese teacher.With his help , my Chinese is getting better and better e
__label__noemo	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	Well , our store offers a 90 - Day return policy and the manufacturer offers a one-year warranty on any factory defects .
__label__noemo	Hello !
__label__noemo	Don't worry . You don't have to do anything.All you have to do is listen . You will enjoy it .
__label__noemo	Would you like any toast , dear ?
__label__noemo	Well , humans could never make something like that .
__label__noemo	You mean you want to stay at home ?
__label__noemo	Don't worry . There are so many people . We will join the touring party .
__label__noemo	OK . I will bring it for you .
__label__noemo	Are you going out , Jack ?
__label__noemo	And can I have some ketchup , please ?
__label__noemo	Tad , I'm pretty hungry right now . Want to walk over and check out the food table ?
__label__noemo	In Thailand . I taught English there .
__label__joy	Aright . See you there .

__label__noemo	It means young girls . That's where you'll find clothes for young girls .
__label__noemo	have you ever been camping in the Boundary Waters ?
__label__noemo	Perhaps people should stop eating animals . We could grow more crops .
__label__joy	Meeting new people is a good thing .
__label__noemo	Have a nice day !
__label__noemo	I know something about it . Our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills .
__label__noemo	That's right , and turn left at the lights .
__label__noemo	No problem . Who is it ? Anyone I know ?
__label__joy	I'm from Shanghai . And you ?
__label__joy	Yes , it's much better than yesterday .
__label__noemo	how do you usually spend your day , now that you ’ Ve retired ?
__label__noemo	We usually eat chicken , pork and beef.you eat these meat a lot in your country too , don't you ?
__label__noemo	That's fine .
__label__noemo	Fine , I can seat you at 7
__label__noemo	Cash or check ?

__label__joy	You have a nice apartment .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__noemo	I'm just browsing , thanks .
__label__joy	That ’ s very kind of you . Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free .
__label__noemo	I don't know . Maybe next week . We haven't been to the Great Wall yet .
__label__noemo	OK , 400 Yuan please .
__label__noemo	Your flight takes off at 8
__label__noemo	OK , anyway , let me have it .
__label__noemo	Sure , it's over there .
__label__noemo	The accounts department , I think .
__label__noemo	I've known from your resume that you are a college graduate .
__label__noemo	Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ’ t it hideous ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me . Have you got the time ?
__label__noemo	Thank you . It's our first date . I hope it's not too offensive .
__label__noemo	Yes , my back aches .
__label__noemo	All the fears are nothing . You can make it . There is no other choice for you . Be brave .
__label__surprise	that was a great dinner . I didn't know that you knew how yo cook .
__label__noemo	It would be good if you could get them to me by Thursday afternoon , Ms . Barkley .
__label__noemo	What is the departure date ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I have , sir . How long are you going on vacation ?
__label__noemo	What can I do for you ?

__label__noemo	Well , I've got to stop and get gas in the car , first .
__label__noemo	Believe me , Mr . Wang . I'll do my best to promote the transaction .
__label__noemo	That's pretty short . Are you sure about this ?
__label__noemo	If I let you do that , then you're just going to be up all night .
__label__noemo	Oh yeah . It loses only a few seconds in the whole month .
__label__joy	exactly ! Oh , my god ! I love Britney ! I'm going to get it .
__label__noemo	you said it . You know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage .
__label__noemo	Okay . I'll fax the itinerary to you immediately .
__label__noemo	Do you know if she's read this one ?
__label__noemo	Certainly . Here's a survey report by a well-known lab in London , whose testimony is absolutely reliable .
__label__noemo	She ’ s a librarian at the public library .
__label__sadness	I really feel sorry for that rhumba boy if he ever identifies himself .
__label__noemo	( after a while ... ) Where's the patient ?
__label__noemo	You are a quick learner . I don't think you'll have any trouble with this .
__label__noemo	How do you put this seat back ? I know there is a lever somewhere .
__label__noemo	I will . Actually , I am worried so much about the security of this community because my house has been burgled twice before .
__label__noemo	No , sir . The bridges are fine.But I've heard rumors that the revolutionaries are coming down from the mountains.There has been fighting , sir .
__label__noemo	But I'm afraid it will take too much of my time .
__label__noemo	Ye Ting , who are these people in the picture ?

__label__noemo	I'm from Canada , originally .
__label__noemo	No . I will fly back twelve days from now .
__label__noemo	Great . What about having a formal interview on Monday next week ?
__label__noemo	She said that she didn ’ t want to foul her own nest .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , but is the reservation for yourself or for another party ?
__label__noemo	A PB & J is pretty easy to make .
__label__noemo	Where are you going this weekend ?
__label__noemo	Can you give me some idea of what you'd like ?
__label__noemo	I see . Well , you have two choices ; you can renew it or redeem it . Which would you prefer ?

__label__noemo	I would rather deal with the winter than the summer .
__label__noemo	Anything else ?
__label__noemo	I saw her yesterday . She was a little better .
__label__noemo	Definitely . It not only keeps me fit but also helps me concentrate on my soul .
__label__noemo	So , Ms . Thou , we're a newly-established company , but we have wide connections with wholesalers and retailers all over America .
__label__noemo	You'll have to make an appointment .

__label__joy	You did ? that is great !
__label__joy	Your dream will come true.It ' s really breathtaking .

__label__noemo	It was after 2 am .
__label__noemo	So what do you think of my new dress ?
__label__noemo	Would you like anything to drink with that ? For $ 1.50 , you can get a two-liter bottle of Coke .
__label__noemo	He was 20 years old then .
__label__joy	Good thinking ! We should also print some leaflets for students to distribute .
__label__noemo	Is there a lot of snow in this region at this time of the year ?
__label__joy	He will enjoy himself this weekend .
__label__noemo	Could you tell me a little about the organization ? For example , how big is your workforce here ?

__label__joy	I'll put the survey online this afternoon .
__label__noemo	But each children has his own interest .
__label__noemo	Good . Now exactly where is it ?
__label__noemo	A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face .
__label__noemo	Unemployment in my country is a fraction of that .
__label__noemo	That is your excuse .
__label__joy	Yes , there is this beautiful view . you may go fishing , camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air .
__label__noemo	Pretty well . Everyone is working hard .
__label__joy	Look ! Allen has the mike !
__label__noemo	Stay just a few minutes longer , OK ?
__label__noemo	What is the salary while on probation ?
__label__noemo	Thanks for your time .
__label__noemo	But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun , while I spend all my time doing reading and writing .
__label__noemo	It's so small that I didn't notice it .
__label__noemo	Certainly , sir .
__label__noemo	Can you leave a message for her to call her office ?
__label__noemo	Our personnel clerk will screen all the resumes that we receive , select the eligible ones and arrange the interview for them .
__label__noemo	Well , we can still do some window shopping , can we ?
__label__noemo	Well , but I need it tomorrow morning .
__label__noemo	yes , I guess I should try to use it .
__label__noemo	Do you have any advice ?
__label__noemo	It's business , Dave .
__label__surprise	Really ? I thought I was doing well .
__label__noemo	What did you do ?
__label__noemo	I'm afraid you must give up the cash . Are you insured ?
__label__noemo	Just let me weigh it for you . That's 2 lb . and 6 oz . That's be £ 10 .

__label__noemo	But you'll miss out on the football game .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time !
__label__noemo	Yeah . I still remember my first car . It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I turned 17 . I drove it around for a couple of years until I scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car .
__label__noemo	It ’ s a problem , because my boss is in that shop now .
__label__noemo	Yes , please do .
__label__surprise	Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ’ s a lot of weight !
__label__noemo	The negotiating bank has just been in touch ...
__label__noemo	Yeah , she ’ s broken up about it , poor kid .
__label__noemo	But he is not someone who can be led by the nose .
__label__joy	Here ! Open mine first .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid I have to go now . The plane will take off soon .
__label__noemo	What courses did you minor in ?
__label__noemo	I plan to take the loan for 3 years .
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__noemo	What ’ s your problem ?
__label__noemo	There must be a mistake .
__label__noemo	And your address , please ?
__label__noemo	Hi , Mary , I didn't see you at work this morning . Are you all right ?
__label__noemo	there ’ s problem with my bank statement . There ’ s a mistake on it . I also need to withdraw some money form the ATM .
__label__noemo	I have two years driving experience .
__label__joy	Thank you . Remember to look me up if you ’ re ever in Washington .
__label__joy	Nice to meet you too , Mr . Zhang .
__label__noemo	How often do you call to them ?
__label__noemo	Oh , sure .
__label__noemo	OK . I would like to book a ticket for that one .
__label__noemo	I preferred the forward with pictures of him side-by-side with monkeys .
__label__noemo	I didn ’ t get accepted .
__label__joy	Of course ! Let ’ s have a look . Great ! In my frame of mind , I ’ d like to buy one today .
__label__noemo	Hi , I would like to make a dinner reservation .
__label__noemo	Hello , is this the ABC company ?
__label__noemo	Could you give me an idea of how larger an amount you want ?
__label__noemo	He was a very easy teacher . Are you thinking of taking a class with him ?
__label__noemo	Well , the government offers its employees excellent health insurance benefits .
__label__noemo	But remind you , there are some forbidden activities .
__label__noemo	Oh . What was your major ?
__label__noemo	Is my membership the same as paying club members ? I mean , can I get discounts at club hotels ?
__label__noemo	Two blocks down the street .
__label__noemo	Where did it happen ?
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , but I just can't find the key . You must have it .
__label__noemo	Just straight .
__label__noemo	Ah ! Not on me ! Ow !
__label__noemo	But that should not be the reason for you to lose heart .
__label__noemo	Have you had anything to eat ?
__label__noemo	It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That's why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .
__label__noemo	Could I have my hair dyed ?
__label__noemo	Okay , thin crust . Your total is $ 21.50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it ’ s free !
__label__noemo	I suppose you're right .
__label__noemo	Well , that's an hour's ride.Why not just post your mail here .
__label__noemo	What would you do with all the animals ? You couldn ’ t just let them go . Besides , some people would still hunt them . Meat has become an integral part of our diet .
__label__noemo	I guess . Don't you have reunions in Taiwan ?
__label__noemo	We met them in Bermuda last May .
__label__noemo	You can come back in twenty minutes , and it will be ready .
__label__noemo	Yes , we're making plans for a tour .
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry . It ’ s for reference only , so it must stay in the library . But you ’ re welcome to look through it .
__label__noemo	I've been pretty busy myself .
__label__noemo	No , that won ’ t be necessary .
__label__joy	Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .
__label__noemo	Well , let me see . We have a nice one on which we still have several unfilled places .
__label__noemo	Nice to meet you here.How come you dropped into this company today ?
__label__noemo	I don ’ t have any symptoms of high blood pressure .
__label__noemo	OK . Thank you . Where should I buy them ?
__label__joy	Oh , I'm glad to hear that . Would you kindly send it to the Hilton Hotel ?
__label__noemo	It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor .
__label__noemo	Did you happen to meet someone ?
__label__noemo	That's good to hear . You've had an ideal recovery from your operation . We're going to send you home tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Open your mouth and say ah ... God , you are suffering from the swelling of tonsils .
__label__joy	Valerie ! Hi ! Wow how are you ? It ’ s been such a long time !
__label__joy	Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant .
__label__noemo	Yes , it did . It went off thirty minutes ago . You slept right through it . You're like a dead person while you sleep .
__label__noemo	Nowadays , ships and boats are no longer so important in transportation as they used to be .
__label__noemo	Hello , ma ’ am , can I help you find something ?
__label__noemo	Yes , Mary ?
__label__noemo	You look run down , Brian .
__label__noemo	It tastes good . How much are the grapes per kilo ?
__label__noemo	Thanks , Serena .
__label__noemo	I won't forget .
__label__joy	We went for a swim in the sea . That was the best part of the day . Just look at my nice tan .
__label__sadness	Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times .
__label__noemo	Not all the same nowadays I must say . Many families , especially those of newly married couples , choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines . Rose and I had a tour to Singapore , Malaysia , Thailand and Hong Kong last year . We stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday .
__label__joy	We would stay longer . but I've got to attend a meeting tomorrow morning . Thank you for your warm hospitality .
__label__noemo	Let me see that . I didn't get one when I came in .
__label__joy	Glad you asked me to join you . This will be fun !
__label__noemo	no , but I've always wanted to do that . I've heard it's a beautiful place to go .
__label__noemo	You ’ d better overcome your nervousness . it is considered an indication that you lack self-confidence .
__label__noemo	What have you been doing ?
__label__noemo	Perhaps you could give her a ring ?
__label__noemo	The gym is open 24/7 , but the stations are open from 7 a . m . to 10 p . m . only .
__label__noemo	Are you going to have a birthday party ?
__label__noemo	Can you tell the result ?
__label__noemo	What if I stay up and do something , until I get tired ?
__label__noemo	Nothing like that . My cousin is going to take a job overseas and he can't take his car with him , so he's going to sell it - cheap . It's practically new .
__label__noemo	Alright , please show me what you have .
__label__noemo	Yes , Mr . Reynolds . They were approved yesterday . You can pick up the check today .
__label__noemo	Let's see if we forget anything .
__label__noemo	If so , I suggest you have a taste for Sichuan food . Most Sichuan dishes are spicy and hot , but they have different tastes .
__label__joy	Sure , we wouldn't miss that for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour .
__label__noemo	Well . Didn ’ t you go around to the Smith after school ? You might have left it there .
__label__noemo	I always do volunteer work on the first Saturday of every month .
__label__noemo	Yes , that's true . Especially my writing . I think my papers aren't good enough . I make too many grammatical mistakes .
__label__noemo	Are you still interested in it ?
__label__noemo	How much is it ? Is three hundred dollars enough ?
__label__noemo	Why so late ? Didn ’ t she want to get married this October ?
__label__noemo	The initial fee still must be paid .
__label__surprise	why ? It ’ s unfair . You can learn a lot from it .
__label__noemo	What are you doing tonight ?
__label__noemo	Well , Peter , you have to do better than that next time , won ’ t you ?
__label__noemo	No , thanks .
__label__noemo	You'll take the blue line until you reach Xizhimen . That's a big station , so there will likely be a lot of people getting off at that stop . You can transfer to the lightrail there , you'll have to exit the subway and present the unused portion of your combination ticket to the Ticketmaster , they'll give you a new ticket to use on the lightrail system .
__label__joy	Hold on , I am looking at the map now . Ok , I can see Horntown Road . Do I go straight at the intersection ?
__label__noemo	I understand , officer . I guess it's just not my day today . I will accept the fine .
__label__disgust	Mark is parade his knowledge again .
__label__noemo	Hey let's go out tomorrow night . The Ram Bar and Grill is having a special on pitchers .
__label__noemo	But we can't have thirteen for dinner !
__label__noemo	Will you be able to solve my problem ?
__label__noemo	Good morning . I want to post this letter . Can you tell me what the postage is ?
__label__joy	Yes , but my house has large windows and so gets lots of sun . And it has a small balcony at the top .
__label__noemo	What's in it , please ?
__label__noemo	If I were you , I wouldn't drink too much .
__label__noemo	Yes . This is Peter calling from New York , I have to change the date of reservation .
__label__noemo	That is no problem at all , of course . You'll get a call at 7 o'colock and another at 7 fifteen .
__label__noemo	Would you mind if I ask some personal questions ?
__label__joy	Great ! Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Great . Let's go !
__label__noemo	I am used to editing with Word 2003 , and there are many pictures in the book .
__label__noemo	Yes , but it's very stressful .
__label__noemo	What are you doing tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	I can't figure out which dress to wear .
__label__joy	Good luck to them .
__label__noemo	Yes , I think so too .
__label__joy	I will .
__label__noemo	Sure . That's really amazing . However I don't have so much time . Do you have a full day cruise ?
__label__noemo	So he is . But , why not try to help him to become stronger ?
__label__noemo	What's the 30 yuan for ?
__label__noemo	I'm afraid not , sir .
__label__noemo	How much are you looking to spend ?
__label__joy	That's all right.Thank you .
__label__noemo	nothing particular .
__label__noemo	You do ?
__label__noemo	What would you like to know ?
__label__noemo	Oh , no , get off it . It wasn ’ t such a killer class . You just have to get into it . Like they say , no pain , no gain .
__label__noemo	It ’ s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . I play the part of the detective . He has to catch the killer , but there ’ s very little evidence . It ’ s a psychological th
__label__noemo	How often do you run your anti-virus program ?
__label__noemo	No , I've not heard of it . Tell me about it .
__label__noemo	What if it exceeds the capacity ?
__label__noemo	Hi . What's up ?
__label__noemo	Where to , sir ?
__label__noemo	Some of my friends play cards on the internet . Have you ever tried that ?
__label__noemo	Perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb .
__label__noemo	I first learned how to do it in high school .
__label__noemo	What about veggies ?
__label__noemo	You just ran a red light .
__label__joy	Thanks , you too .
__label__noemo	I like all sorts of movies , primarily drama and science fiction .
__label__noemo	Yes , thank you very much .
__label__noemo	How did you get that ? No need to show you my hand , I lose.This is not as much fun as the music concert we just saw .
__label__noemo	Whatever , I ’ m going to go watch the opening match .
__label__noemo	Where is it located ?
__label__joy	Cool !
__label__joy	Yes . I have . I liked it very much . Like you , I was very impressed with Rachel ’ s performance in the movie . She ’ s going to be a star .
__label__noemo	There is too much traffic in Taipei these days , I think cars should be banned .
__label__joy	Um ... Uh ... I'm just looking , thanks .
__label__noemo	I don't think so .
__label__noemo	To be honest with you , Jason , I don't think I'm doing a very good job of balancing my schoolwork with my job . I'm always two steps behind . I've got to get back to the dorm and continue writing that paper . Say ! Why don ’ t you talk to your advisor ? And let me know !
__label__noemo	Have you travelled to many other countries ?
__label__joy	Mm , I love burnt bread .
__label__noemo	i do , too .
__label__joy	Yeah , we've experienced the 8.0 magnitude earthquake in Wenchman .
__label__noemo	I am very active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like leaving them half done .
__label__noemo	I went back home last night . You know tired as a dog , so I took a quick shower and went to bed . I couldn't fall asleep , because Brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . I kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . He shouted at me .
__label__joy	All right . Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality .
__label__noemo	Yes , I did . I ’ Ve put one on the table for each child . I put up the big “ happy birthday ” sign too .
__label__noemo	Andrew's Hair Salon , this is Andrew .
__label__noemo	It's very dark in here . Will you turn on the light ?
__label__noemo	What position do you play ?
__label__noemo	How did you grow such long nails ?
__label__noemo	Then why does he let himself be lead by the nose ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I'm from Taiwan . I never heard of a gas station where you fill up your own car .
__label__anger	I got robbed .
__label__noemo	What kind of keys ?
__label__noemo	in a few weeks . Are you planning on watching them ?
__label__noemo	It takes some time for the stuff you buy online to arrive . But I think this problem will be solved soon .
__label__noemo	A $ 100 000 policy shouldn't be too expensive . Here , call my agent . He'll give you a good deal .
__label__noemo	Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did ’ t know that you had split up . What happened ?
__label__fear	I'm scared .
__label__joy	OK . Let's go .
__label__noemo	I see ! How many pieces of cake did you eat ?
__label__noemo	My elder aunt feels like vomiting , she is pregnant .
__label__noemo	So Vicky , how long have you held your present position ?
__label__noemo	I am wiped out . Thank you .
__label__noemo	Why not ?
__label__noemo	I would like to ask for one day off next week . Do you think the manager will agree ? I know it is the busy time for our company , but I do have some important things to handle .
__label__noemo	Thank you . Please call me at any time if you have any questions .
__label__joy	Great ! I'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . Could you tell me the detailed dress ?
__label__joy	How about Thursday ?
__label__noemo	It's about 200 years old . It has a lot of history !
__label__joy	I'm sorry.It ' s out of season now .
__label__surprise	What ? But it is my favorite piece of clothing .
__label__noemo	Have you given the puppies anything to eat today ?
__label__noemo	As long as you don ’ t overdo it , a glass of wine a day should be OK .
__label__joy	Thomas , if I could write with the beauty in her eyes , I was born to look in them and know myself .
__label__noemo	I've got a reservation here . My name is John Sandals .
__label__noemo	You bought a compact car ?
__label__noemo	I see why it lags behind other towns .
__label__noemo	My name is Dunlin and I live in Beijing . I was born in 1980 . I will graduate from Peking University this July . I have majored in accounting .
__label__noemo	Of course . We can give you a call anytime you like .
__label__noemo	OK , there you are .
__label__noemo	Now , sign your name on the back of the card .
__label__noemo	We mostly handle office furniture . We supply first-class furniture . Here are our catalogue and the pattern books . You can see the material is superior and with all the latest styles . Can you give me some idea about what you're looking for ?
__label__noemo	Can you tell me what happened here ?
__label__noemo	S :: Welcome to Flash Foto.What can I do for you , ma ’ am ?
__label__sadness	I am still waiting for their call .
__label__joy	Oh , thanks all the same .
__label__joy	Many happy returns of the day , darling ?
__label__noemo	I'll go get the chips . What do you want to drink ?
__label__noemo	Thank you , Mr . Johnson . May I ask you one more question ? When will your property become available ?
__label__joy	Okay , that's good . I get it .
__label__sadness	I knew this would happen some day ...
__label__noemo	What do you believe , John ? Are you Christian ?
__label__sadness	I already had that idea .
__label__noemo	I got it . Then I should mention my educating background and working experience , should I ?
__label__noemo	Yes , whenever I think about China , I'd see the Tian'an Men Square . China is a very beautiful country . And I've seen many landmarks in China but I like the Great Wall most .
__label__joy	Sounds nice . We will take this , two bowls of shrimp rolls .
__label__noemo	Ok , as John after Kennedy put it , let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate .
__label__noemo	No problem , we have a short form right here ; just hand it to me when you are done .
__label__noemo	No problem .
__label__noemo	You could be right .
__label__noemo	Yes . What is the rent ?
__label__noemo	I've heard that people in your country like mutton chops .
__label__noemo	But as to me finding a good job is the most important thing .
__label__joy	That's a good idea.We haven't been there for ages .
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__anger	You can say that again . Susan ’ brother dropped in from out of town , so I offered to put him up for a few days . But he ’ s driving me up a wall . This guy is bottomless pit .
__label__noemo	What about the loan repayment ?
__label__noemo	Bring me a cup of coffee , please .
__label__noemo	6,000 miles , all highway mileage .
__label__sadness	I am not in the mood .
__label__noemo	Thanks . I'll let him know .
__label__noemo	Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
__label__noemo	What have you learnt from this short experience ?
__label__joy	Oh , this is just fine .
__label__joy	I like that .
__label__noemo	I don't know . I think you might be over the hill .
__label__noemo	I make around one hundred thousand dollars per year .
__label__noemo	Taxi ! ! !
__label__noemo	I am sorry you didn't enjoy it , sir . I will return it to the kitchen and bring you one that is well cooked . How is your steak this time , sir ?
__label__anger	I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there is .
__label__noemo	I'm glad to meet you , Mr . Zhuang . Sit down , please .
__label__noemo	Yes , here are what we have exclusively for our guests .
__label__noemo	10,000 sq . m . You should give us a discount for such a large quantity .
__label__noemo	That ’ s fine .
__label__disgust	Look at me . I look so old ! I look as if I were thirty .
__label__noemo	Yeah . I'm really looking forward to it .
__label__noemo	It ’ s Saturday , a great weekend .
__label__noemo	I need to get one .
__label__noemo	This is today ’ s schedule . At 8: 30AM , conference with the department managers . At 9 o ’ clock , live for the workshop where you ’ ll award prizes to the staff for preventatives .
__label__noemo	Let me see the notice . It is here . Our booth number is E108 . Good number .
__label__noemo	Hey Rachael , what's up ? How is your day ?
__label__noemo	But I have to go to my homeroom .
__label__noemo	When I first moved in , I walked everywhere . But within a week , I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now , I always take public transportation .
__label__noemo	John dates her seven times a week .
__label__noemo	It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months .
__label__noemo	maybe your boss isn't so horrible after all !
__label__noemo	My pleasure . I hope you get a hold of him .
__label__noemo	Seven , please .
__label__joy	Our softball team is in the finals ! We ’ re playing the McGrath office on Saturday .
__label__joy	Yeah , time is money . We really need to make good use of it .
__label__noemo	Why are you willing to work for our company ?
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Because they are rednecks .
__label__noemo	455623 .
__label__noemo	Brian , a company called me for an interview .
__label__noemo	I have a special party tonight , and I'd like to change my style . Actually , I ’ m thinking about a perm . My sister is getting married next month . I think that if I have a perm now , I'll look very natural by then . What do you say ?
__label__noemo	Good afternoon . Reservations . May I help you ?
__label__noemo	In order to achieve that objective . I would work step by step and make further study .
__label__noemo	There were no major problems . One leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that I found .
__label__noemo	Which team is your favorite ?
__label__noemo	I hear you , sir . Nonsmoking . Now , about the bed , is a queen-size okay ?
__label__joy	It was great ! How was your year ?
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__noemo	I want to reserve a VIP room at 7:00 this evening .
__label__noemo	Well , all the drinks including beer are free of charge .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , can you tell me the way to the British Museum ?
__label__joy	Sure . The sunny days of spring are ideal for outdoor gatherings .
__label__noemo	well , what do you have in mind ?
__label__noemo	Things change every minute .
__label__noemo	Oh , you are out of breath ! What ’ s happened ?
__label__noemo	Shall we discuss the packing ? You know , a well-designed package helps sell the goods , so the products must not only be superior in quality , but also attractive in appearance . I'd like to see the sample of packing .
__label__noemo	of what ?
__label__noemo	The last one clockwise .
__label__noemo	How long should I continue taking them ?
__label__noemo	Ok , this premium for the difference between 130 % and 110 % of the invoice value should be borne by the buyer .
__label__noemo	Well , these are for internal use.You take a packet each time.Four times a day .
__label__noemo	No . Every spring time around April , I'm stricken with allergies .
__label__noemo	Well , I could put you on a waiting list.But that doesn't guarantee you will get into the class . What is your name ?
__label__joy	Good . I love Chinese food . What did you order ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it is the credit demand.Where can I cash travellers ' cheques ?
__label__noemo	I know what you're saying , but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy .
__label__noemo	Sure ! Are you okay ? You seem a bit worried.What ’ s on your mind ?
__label__noemo	I see . okay , well let ’ s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
__label__noemo	My house is up in Altadena .
__label__noemo	Yeah , the doctor said that I can leave soon . I really miss home .
__label__noemo	Good morning , Miss Wu ! Can I ask you something ?
__label__noemo	Aah ! Close your eyes . You aren't supposed to see this .
__label__noemo	No way , if it still has 21 .
__label__noemo	Well , I cook a lot of big meals .
__label__noemo	Look on the rack to the right .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'd like to exchange some US dollars into RIB .
__label__noemo	Oh no , this type gets dirty very easily and it's difficult to clean .
__label__noemo	I don't think we have any food .
__label__noemo	Oh , by the way , could you give me a ride ? My car is still in the garage .
__label__noemo	Oh , that's good . I should be able to find it pretty easily then . Is that far from here ?
__label__noemo	I would like to use a computer .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I will .
__label__noemo	I didn't realize until after our date that they weren't my type .
__label__noemo	Wow , your roommates are cleaning the room .
__label__joy	Sure , I'd love to . Thank you .
__label__noemo	Good . We will make the offer tomorrow afternoon . Is that all right ?
__label__noemo	What are the seasons like in your city ?
__label__noemo	I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
__label__noemo	Let me write it down on this slip of paper for you . You can show it to the taxi-driver .
__label__noemo	I'm from China . What about you ?
__label__noemo	Hello , Madam . What can I do for you today ?
__label__joy	Congratulations ! Why do people hold parties before the baby is born ?
__label__noemo	Yes . Flight DP336 leaves at 15:16 . Is that all right ?
__label__noemo	Sure . You can find everything all over the world . Let ’ s check it out online !
__label__noemo	Yeah , I ’ m trying to decorate my house .
__label__noemo	Let's get this card for mom , it's funny .
__label__noemo	No , who won ?
__label__noemo	I feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter's disease .
__label__noemo	Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren .
__label__noemo	Well , they had enough harvests for the next winter and celebration 。 They decided to have a big feast for the natives , giving thanks the land , and everyone for the foods , healthy and new lives .
__label__noemo	Yes , there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it . Besides , you see , in recent years , we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness .
__label__noemo	Will you be voting ?
__label__noemo	OK , just take a deep breath , Sir . Everything is going to be fine . Here's a form to report missing Traveller's Cheques , whatever the reason . Please fill it in and we can get moving on this .
__label__noemo	I ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere .
__label__noemo	Doing what ?
__label__noemo	OK . See you at noon .
__label__noemo	When can you get the finished product to me ?
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , Lucy . I'm afraid that I can't get up .
__label__noemo	Well , I will look around your shop some more . I need to think about it .
__label__noemo	You can just put Dear Sir or Madam , officialese not personal , you can write to whom may concerned .
__label__noemo	The rent is $ 600 a month ?
__label__noemo	What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	When will we get one of those ?
__label__joy	Yes , but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again !
__label__noemo	Day tour . How much does that cost ?
__label__noemo	I just need to see some ID , like a passport for example .
__label__surprise	Huh ? You are breaking our rule already ! And we didn't even start to play yet !
__label__noemo	No problem . Look at this one . Same pan , but with a lightweight wooden handle .
__label__noemo	How about a snack after work ?
__label__joy	Yes . that is a very good idea . It would be a shame if we could not find a place to sit .
__label__noemo	I see , so it's similar to global warming ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I commute five days a week by train .
__label__noemo	Did you hear what happened to Mike in Accounts ?
__label__noemo	He asked me if I'd like to be a newspaper salesperson ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , that's nice .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I guess so . I've never actually heard of this one , but ...
__label__noemo	You would like me to send this to all managerial staff ? I'm sorry , sir , could you please clarify ? Who all is included in managerial staff ?
__label__noemo	I'm try to write a letter to one of our clients , But I just don't know exactly what to say , I don't even know how to get started , I know I should write dear Mr . Mrs . or Ms . , but the problem is I don't know the name of contact person .
__label__joy	Not at all . I am pleased to tell you these .
__label__noemo	That sounds really neat . Is there an extra charge for these swim stations ?
__label__joy	Well , thanks for the compliment anyway !
__label__joy	That's great . Then we won't fight over taking the same ride .
__label__noemo	Today's rate is 821.32 USD to 100 RIB , which isn't bad .
__label__noemo	Thanks a lot . Oh , excuse me . Can I take two value meals ? And I want some chili paste .
__label__joy	Yes , you are right . I love flowers and hence have taken to growing them . I take care of my flowers every day as if they are my good friends .
__label__noemo	Afternoon , please , if that's possible .
__label__noemo	Maybe , but I think they are just for kids .
__label__noemo	About three times a week if I can .
__label__noemo	The Rockets .
__label__noemo	What do you want me to do about it ?
__label__noemo	When we were students , he was no good in any subject .
__label__joy	What a great weekend that was !
__label__joy	He looks like a very personable man .
__label__joy	A small glass , or a big one ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to have it in big waves .
__label__joy	I like him very much . He ’ s a gay dog .
__label__noemo	Enter your PIN .
__label__noemo	Yes , but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
__label__noemo	Saturday ? Oh , I have a previous engagement .
__label__noemo	Hum , me too . This winter holiday was especially long . What have you done ?
__label__noemo	Have you packed the camera yet ?
__label__noemo	$ 300 per month .
__label__noemo	Not a great deal .
__label__noemo	And it ’ s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ’ s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her .
__label__noemo	When do you need them , sir ?
__label__noemo	There's nothing left from dinner .
__label__noemo	Hey . I just played basketball earlier , so my legs are a little sore . Let's work out on arms and stomach today .
__label__noemo	That's as it should be . When will it be paid in and credited to our account ?
__label__noemo	The baggage allowance is different according to the class of your ticket . What class are you travelling ?
__label__noemo	Yes that ’ s right . I ’ Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I ’ m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed school .
__label__noemo	For what ? I thought you didn't like western food .
__label__surprise	Me ? Oh , no . In fact , I took up dancing quite recently .
__label__noemo	Is there any way that you can fix my schedule ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I wrote a thesis entitled English Education in High School and it was published in the Education Magazine .
__label__noemo	Not hot but warm . Very comfortable .
__label__noemo	Your quantity sold is beyond the required by more than 30 % .
__label__noemo	One of the reasons for our good quality products is because of our quality inspection system , which is the best of its kind .
__label__noemo	Double-room , please . It's for an American couple .
__label__sadness	I know , but I was so upset . I mean , come on ! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ?
__label__noemo	I want a refund !
__label__noemo	How many tickets do you want ?
__label__noemo	Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen .
__label__noemo	Do you think that my job pays unemployment ?
__label__noemo	What would you do without me ?
__label__noemo	Have you got anything for diarrhea ?
__label__noemo	Is this room with a bath room ?
__label__noemo	Can I pay with traveller's cheques ?
__label__noemo	I could do some typing for you .
__label__noemo	I ’ m sure you will enjoy yourselves .
__label__noemo	I studied French . Anyway ... that's enough about me.How about you ? Were you born in L . A . ?
__label__noemo	Could I just stop you there ? Sorry to interrupt , but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want .
__label__noemo	Yes , we are very close . He is 12 years old now and very smart . He always makes us laugh a lot .
__label__noemo	Write down your name here in ink .
__label__noemo	Oh yes ! Sometimes it rains very heavily.How about here in Beijing ?
__label__noemo	No , this is my first time here .
__label__noemo	OK , sir . I'll see what I can do .
__label__noemo	How do you like the food sold in this sidewalk snack booth ?
__label__noemo	"Yes , it has . Some Mexicans are crazy . They drink a lot of liquors even on hot days . Have you ever heard of "" Tequila Sauta "" ?"
__label__noemo	By the way , do you work out ?
__label__noemo	No , I don't . So I need some help .
__label__noemo	I know sir ! We didn ’ t expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden . On the other hand , you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses and reinvest in emerging markets . We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box .
__label__noemo	I'd be quite willing to if I could , but we must comply with the label requirements according to our law , or we can't clear the consignment of lichee through the Customs .
__label__noemo	That sure didn't last long !
__label__noemo	Yes , he married my sister ten years ago .
__label__noemo	I haven't made up my mind . Maybe I will go to the US . What about you ?
__label__noemo	You ’ re so picky sometimes .
__label__noemo	Oh , sure .
__label__noemo	I'm very much interested in the position .
__label__noemo	You ’ re a big fan of Andy Lau , aren ’ t you ?
__label__noemo	Would you like to go sightseeing tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	Um .. I don ’ t think so . I need the car tonight to pick up your mother .
__label__noemo	If I could do it in the morning , then that would be good .
__label__noemo	No , fireworks are awesome !
__label__noemo	Not until you have paid 10 percent margin .
__label__joy	no , it's definitely my turn to treat you ... you paid last time !
__label__noemo	what date is it today ?
__label__noemo	Hi , Bob , what time will you be home tonight ?
__label__joy	Is it made of chocolate ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children .
__label__noemo	Is it a long ride to Beijing Library ?
__label__joy	all right . How about this black shirt ? It can be worn for anything---a party , a job interview and even a funeral !
__label__noemo	Did you tell others that we are getting married soon ? You have such a big mouth !
__label__noemo	According to some studies it may cause cancer .
__label__noemo	No , I can't . I've really got important business .
__label__noemo	If you like the place , you can fill out an application form . I'll bring one with me .
__label__noemo	No problem , just get rid of the bugs !
__label__joy	Thank you for inviting me . Sounds lovely ! I would like to come . Where is your new apartment ?
__label__noemo	Thanks . I appreciate the hand . I ’ d have to make two or three trips on my own .
__label__noemo	I would give him or her basic first aid and ask my partner to call for assistance at the same time .
__label__noemo	Do you know who did ?
__label__noemo	We could make it lower for you . What's your counter-offer ?
__label__noemo	Are you ready to order ?
__label__noemo	You've got a point there . It is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit . There is no need to ask if he needs it or not , or if he wants something else . It might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea .
__label__noemo	Anything to drink , sir ?
__label__noemo	Sure , honey , we ’ re talking now , aren ’ t we ?
__label__noemo	How can we keep track of our grades ?
__label__noemo	I have worked as an executive secretary for 5 years , first for trading companies , and now I am working for a trust company . I interact well with peers , clients , administrators and bosses . I thrive on challenge and work well in high-stress environments .
__label__noemo	All right . Give me a big smile . Are you ready ? Cheese !
__label__noemo	My name is Jessica . What's yours ?
__label__noemo	when was the last time you have track up ?
__label__noemo	So , Fred , what are your plans for after graduation ?
__label__noemo	How's your new car ?
__label__noemo	That's a good idea . And remind them to be slow at the beginning , not to run into the railings .
__label__noemo	I guess that ’ s out . Why don ’ t we go shopping ?
__label__noemo	The hardware of computer is basically all the concrete things you can touch with your hands and see with your eyes .
__label__noemo	How long have you been on your current job ?
__label__noemo	Mr . Allen , I have just received your note which informs me that you have offered the accountant position to another candidate . May I ask why I was defeated ?
__label__noemo	One kilogram , too .
__label__noemo	Well.let ’ s get going then ! I love road trips !
__label__noemo	yes , employees can take up to 10 days of sick leave per year . However , in order to get paid , you ’ ll have to bring in a note from the doctor ’ s .
__label__noemo	They ’ re dark gray .
__label__joy	the port is exquisite . It must have spent years aging in barrels . Am I right ?
__label__joy	really ? I thought you hated shopping ?
__label__joy	Hello , Tom . How do you find the dinner of yesterday ?
__label__noemo	Your parents are not like that ?
__label__joy	The food there is wonderful .
__label__noemo	You are welcome . See you next time .
__label__noemo	Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A .
__label__noemo	How did that happen ?
__label__noemo	We could take a cut on the price . But 25 % would reduce much our profit margin . We suggest a compromise 10 % .
__label__noemo	Yes . When do you want it ?
__label__noemo	Single , please .
__label__noemo	Hello , Ms . Barkley . How are you ?
__label__noemo	It's Monday , October 27 . Speaking of dates , when are you leaving ?
__label__noemo	What do you use your computer for ?
__label__noemo	You must have seen some other kind of bird .
__label__noemo	Could you please tell me when I get to the Central Park ?
__label__noemo	But I need a pretty decent job . I need to make enough to pay my rent at least .
__label__noemo	On the Internet ? I have never tried that way .
__label__noemo	No wonder you say English is a crazy language .
__label__noemo	Professor Wood ? I think he's a brilliant scientist .
__label__noemo	What is it ?
__label__noemo	It must be a haunted house . Are you frightened ?
__label__noemo	You are being watched ! Be careful Dan ! Be careful !
__label__noemo	Sure . We also would like to use the chairs from the lunchroom . Would that be OK ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry , but Mr.Thomas left the office a few minutes ago .
__label__noemo	Okay , you call them .
__label__noemo	Ah ! I get your point . We have just what you need . Our Jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . The one bedroom apartments are very economical , but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . I think you can find a very apartment there .
__label__noemo	Not at all . Go ahead .
__label__noemo	Good afternoon . May I help you ?
__label__surprise	I can ’ t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure .
__label__noemo	Are there many choices of online shopping ?
__label__noemo	Not really . You should try to not eat foods high in calories , salts or saturated fats . Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors .
__label__noemo	Not quite . I also like romance and comedy movies very much .
__label__joy	Very well , I can ring you up over here , sir .
__label__noemo	Sure , what can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted .
__label__joy	Of course . Let's go .
__label__noemo	Do you have enough money to buy that dress ?
__label__anger	I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something .
__label__noemo	You're right .
__label__noemo	Here is your room . I hope you like it .
__label__noemo	What section did you work in ?
__label__noemo	I have a long flight for ten hours . I need to choose a magazine .
__label__noemo	So what do these organs do , teacher ?
__label__joy	OK.thank you .
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome . Be sure to get the keys one day before you move in .
__label__noemo	What do you drink ?
__label__noemo	Are you going to vote on Tuesday ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I like movies with surprise endings , although , sometimes they can be frustrating . Maybe I should invite my girlfriend to go next weekend .
__label__sadness	Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry .
__label__joy	Cool ! I can't believe he agreed to go all the way to Dallas with us !
__label__noemo	It's summer in Sydney so you have to bring your summer wear .
__label__joy	Now the band is playing a slow dance .
__label__noemo	It's $ 32.00 .
__label__noemo	How many years have you had the driver's license ?
__label__noemo	Yes , of course . If you like the room , call the landlord and confirm the information of the room .
__label__noemo	I listen to various types of music .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'd like another cup of coffee afterwards . Make it hot , please .
__label__noemo	I'll have the lamb chops , well-done , please .
__label__noemo	Sir , wait ! ! I need your address !
__label__noemo	Indeed . He's strict with himself too . We can see every lecture of his is well-prepared .
__label__noemo	What was that ?
__label__noemo	I could try , but I can ’ t say for sure if I ’ ll get up in time . What time do you want to go ?
__label__noemo	She is as meek as a lamb . She never goes against anyone or anything . She's as good as gold , you know ?
__label__noemo	Do you play any sports or games ?
__label__noemo	I can't agree to that . My company will have to pay for both sending them and bringing them back .
__label__noemo	You don ’ t mind if I smoke , do you ?
__label__noemo	At 7:30 p . m .
__label__disgust	I agree completely . I just don't understand what's wrong with them . Don't they have any humanity ?
__label__noemo	Would you like to play golf with me ?
__label__noemo	Oh , sorry to hear that . Listen , I ’ Ve got a rush order . Can you help me out ?
__label__noemo	I'm planning a trip to Europe .
__label__noemo	I didn ’ t know you were working there this year .
__label__noemo	I have to start eating better too .
__label__joy	The weather is really nice today . Let's walk .
__label__joy	You're lucky !
__label__noemo	Is it very cold in winter ?
__label__joy	Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too .
__label__noemo	I think so .
__label__joy	Here it is .
__label__noemo	David , we have been doing business for three years , haven't we ?
__label__noemo	Can you give me a hand , Tom ?
__label__noemo	Well , I ’ m not too sure , actually . I ’ Ve got a lot going on the next couple of weeks . Why don ’ t I call you later ?
__label__noemo	I told you to wear running shoes . But you don't listen .
__label__noemo	Hi , Mr . Sandals . I'm Michelle , at your service . When do you need the room ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s fun meeting new people .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Next Monday .
__label__noemo	That's a very good lesson . We must familiarize ourselves with the exam from now on .
__label__noemo	Who cares ? She is pretty .
__label__noemo	What about these shirts ? Do you see anything you like ?
__label__noemo	No problem .
__label__noemo	OK , OK , fine ! Just open the gate !
__label__noemo	Well , I think you should pay upon arrival .
__label__noemo	I see .
__label__noemo	I have studied its skills recently at a training school . I plan to run a restaurant , so I have to practise cooking !
__label__noemo	What does your company do exactly ?
__label__noemo	Yes , you'd print out the address and telephone number of those guests from your computer , and then send those materials to each business worker .
__label__noemo	Sure , no problem . As I said , cartons are good enough for goods like this . You don't have to worry about it .
__label__surprise	Jeez ... I didn ’ t realize a single bedroom apartment went for so much these days .
__label__noemo	How long do you intend to stay ?
__label__noemo	Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call .
__label__noemo	That ’ s what I ’ Ve heard . But as far as I ’ m concerned , it takes a genius to figure it out . Can you pass the sugar , please ?
__label__noemo	Two years .
__label__noemo	Good morning ! I'd like to buy twelve tickets to Beijing for October 14th .
__label__noemo	Good morning . I'd like to reserve some rooms for a tourist party .
__label__noemo	I don't understand . You don't even know the ' friends ' you are ' talking ' to !
__label__noemo	For me , it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play .
__label__noemo	You mean we'll share the taxi ?
__label__noemo	Yes , we have a showroom not far away from here , Mr . Black . Are you free now ?
__label__noemo	She even stayed at a different hotel . She said I might be contagious .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t worry . You can take night classes . I did that when I had kids . And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . Then you could find a job and work .
__label__noemo	How long do we stop over here ?
__label__noemo	that's amazing . Are you doing well in your classes ?
__label__joy	All right . Next time you will treat .
__label__noemo	Why did you drag me into this ? I've spent a week salary .
__label__noemo	That's OK . How can my salary be improved ?
__label__noemo	How about Music Madness ?
__label__noemo	Does all that come to 10,000 NT ?
__label__noemo	Can I borrow five bucks ?
__label__noemo	Oh , yeah , it ’ s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt .
__label__noemo	But she feels like having no appetite at all if she stays at home all day .
__label__noemo	What do you mean ? It will help us to relax .
__label__noemo	Do you take your dog for a walk every day ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I can get it for you but I need to go back inside the bank .
__label__noemo	My husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate .
__label__noemo	We are going to use this cuff here , and it will give me a reading .
__label__noemo	Maybe some other time .
__label__noemo	Thank you , that will be all . I ’ ll take care of it .
__label__anger	Get out of my store , you jerk !
__label__noemo	Sure , I'll get it for you.Books or magazines ?
__label__joy	Yes , l have two of her Cds , l'II lend them to you if you like .
__label__noemo	How about recycling ? Does that actually help ?
__label__noemo	That's Susan .
__label__joy	That ’ s really interesting , you have to play for me some time .
__label__sadness	well , I'm really worried about my grades . I didn't think this course would be so stressful .
__label__noemo	The doctor told me to stay about one month .
__label__noemo	Poor cat .
__label__noemo	Well , on Saturday I cleaned the house and played tennis . Then on Sunday I hiked in the country .
__label__noemo	Just this ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to see some traditional arts .
__label__noemo	We'll go tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Here . Let me give you an application form .
__label__joy	That's a good idea . You'd better hurry up before they've filled all classes . Many people are learning how to drive now .
__label__noemo	I envy them the sun .
__label__noemo	Don't worry about it . It must be somewhere in your room . Let's see where you put it . Have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
__label__noemo	Oh , lots of things . Mostly training new people .
__label__noemo	Well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start .
__label__noemo	If we work on this tomorrow night , you could easily be ready by Friday .
__label__noemo	Yes , no problem . You walk down this street . You turn left at the first intersection . Walk along that road , turn right at the corner . After that , you make a left-hand turn at the first traffic light . The Royal Hotel is on your right side .
__label__noemo	I hope so .
__label__noemo	You can only view the apartment with an appointment .
__label__joy	Oh , come on ! Failure is the mother of success . Don ’ t lose heart . I'm sure you'll succeed .
__label__noemo	You see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening .
__label__noemo	Aren ’ t you going to swim ?
__label__noemo	Yes , do you like it ?
__label__noemo	Okay , next question . If Eric asked you out on a date , what would you say ?
__label__noemo	Could you wait a moment ? I have to get a trolley . May I see your room key , please ?
__label__noemo	Mr . Li , the report has been finished .
__label__noemo	I find it interesting .
__label__noemo	Okay , I think that I understand .
__label__noemo	I hear the drinks and food there are moderately priced.You should be fine .
__label__noemo	He must be happy .
__label__noemo	That ’ s true . But as a woman , I ’ m glad that even though I don ’ t want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can ’ t imagine what China would be like if there weren ’ t a one-child policy !
__label__noemo	Why do people like all this fancy , expensive underwear ?
__label__noemo	Just dab it all over your face and then take a look at the symbols that appear .
__label__joy	No problem , sir .
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__joy	Have you enjoyed your weekend ?
__label__noemo	We used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good , very good . But , the clients reacted very negatively when they saw her . Some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively .
__label__noemo	Well , I am up to my neck in work . I've got to finish this report . Sarah needs it by noon . I don't want to be scolded if I can ’ t finish my work by the deadline .
__label__joy	Oh , that would be very useful .
__label__noemo	Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .
__label__joy	You are welcome .
__label__joy	Your budget is a good idea .
__label__noemo	You are asking the right person . Here are two very important tips . First , you need to visit no more than one site to find the best products and prices . I can recommend you some online merchants . Second , write your mail address correctly . Otherwise , you can ’ t receive your delivery in time .
__label__noemo	By the way , how much does it cost to send a package to Taiwan ?
__label__noemo	But you could have saved money .
__label__noemo	It's OK . She normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder , and I don't know what shade to buy .
__label__noemo	I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it .
__label__noemo	Speaking .
__label__noemo	We serve different styles of Chinese food here . But I'm not sure which one do you prefer .
__label__noemo	I prefer a sedentary job and I used to work as an operator .
__label__noemo	It's here at last !
__label__noemo	I need this magazine .
__label__noemo	It is in mine too . The biggest issue is water . The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important .
__label__noemo	Shall we check your oil and tires ?
__label__noemo	When I told David I was coming here to live , he give me your number , and suggest that I give your a ring . I was wondering if you could give me some advices .
__label__noemo	10 years ago , maybe yes . But nowadays we are a global village , it's easy to deal with any foreign country .
__label__surprise	You must be joking . The job is nice and she is well paid .
__label__joy	That's nice . And I need a pre-paid phone card .
__label__noemo	I had no idea how seriously that country takes soccer !
__label__noemo	Did you have a fight with Jack ?
__label__disgust	I've no idea . Oh yes , and the most ridiculous thing . He asked me what I had for breakfast this morning .
__label__noemo	Don't mention it .
__label__joy	Certainly . ( Take a table-cloth to her )
__label__joy	You have a perfect taste !
__label__noemo	No problem , but you've got to be careful .
__label__noemo	you mean he plays well ? Yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks .
__label__noemo	According to the regulations , the camera you've brought along for personal use can be passed for the time being duty free , but you will have to take it out with you when you leave the country .
__label__noemo	You ’ re welcome .
__label__noemo	I went to try it on yesterday , but it only came in extra small .
__label__joy	You're right , that is great .
__label__noemo	Yes , is there any vacant room for tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	I find the sheet in my room is so stained.Would you please help us change it for a clean one ?
__label__noemo	No , you don't have to . Here comes the train . Be careful ! Subway doors open and close automatically .
__label__noemo	Look at the map . It has different areas , such as marine lives , mammals , polar animals and insects .
__label__noemo	Ok , I'll use my Visa . Here you are .
__label__noemo	Is the seed edible ?
__label__noemo	Do we have it available ?
__label__noemo	I'll be happy to get back to you with an estimate in the next few days .
__label__noemo	I am from China .
__label__noemo	Here , use this rag to apply pressure to the cut . Does it hurt ?
__label__noemo	Yes , we have several brands , which one do you prefer ?
__label__noemo	Is there a problem ?
__label__noemo	Jess ? Well , she ’ s very smart , and has a great sense of humor . She ’ s very feminine ...
__label__noemo	Quite a few actually . By the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . My friend has invited us . Do you want to go ?
__label__noemo	Well , I thought it was not that serious .
__label__joy	How can I ever thank you ? I owe you a big favor .
__label__noemo	How good are you at sports , Bill ?
__label__noemo	What kind of personality do you think you have ?
__label__noemo	Good morning . Could you tell me the times of trains to London , please ?
__label__noemo	Hurry up , will you ?
__label__noemo	Are you getting overtime ?
__label__noemo	He wouldn't say over the phone .
__label__noemo	But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet , I have no idea how I could have picked a virus .
__label__joy	I would look so cool carrying this around !
__label__noemo	DO you have any plan for your future ?
__label__noemo	You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her .
__label__noemo	All right . Goodbye .
__label__noemo	isn ’ t it really cold there ?
__label__joy	Yes ! Let ’ s go sailing and water skiing . That ’ s so exciting .
__label__noemo	Does it rain a lot in summer there ?
__label__noemo	Our special tonight is lobster .
__label__noemo	Someone else is making charges on my debit card .
__label__noemo	What do you mean by that ?
__label__noemo	Wait a second , PLS . Yes , Mr . Lee , we have a room reserved for you . How long do you plan to stay ?
__label__noemo	Of course , I should have been more careful . I ’ m sorry .
__label__noemo	How many rolls altogether ?
__label__noemo	Maybe you haven't found the magic .
__label__noemo	I'm not keen on dessert as a habit . They are fattening .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I think I'll get this one-piece .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , how long is the flight to Phoenix ?
__label__noemo	Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military ?
__label__noemo	Isn't that dangerous though ? I mean bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or re-heated ?
__label__noemo	What's the difference in price ?
__label__noemo	Don't worry . You'll do fine .
__label__noemo	No . I didn't kill him on purpose , madam . It's him who caused the incident . I need to see my attorney .
__label__noemo	Is that a one-way or round trip ?
__label__noemo	Which kinds of vegetables do people in your country usually eat ?
__label__noemo	No problem . We'll bring you the towels in just a minute .
__label__noemo	Can you tell me the differences between a letter and a memorandum , Miss Thong ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I did . Don't worry .
__label__noemo	Let ’ s see ... I would say about eight hundred dollars .
__label__sadness	I'm terribly sorry . You know we are so busy today and we forget to sew the button back on . Please wait a moment . It will be ready soon .
__label__noemo	It's my geography , sir.The Map of Africa you set us .
__label__noemo	Sure , but what do I wear ?
__label__joy	it certainly is .
__label__noemo	No . Which one do you recommend ?
__label__noemo	We expect the goods to be on the market before the end of December to catch up with the Spring Festival sales .
__label__noemo	That ’ s fine ... I need to pick up some stationary-you know , a stapler , scissors , files , who should I see about that ?
__label__noemo	I see .
__label__noemo	Our profit margin is in the neighborhood of 20 % .
__label__noemo	Have you got some ID and your cash card ?
__label__noemo	Of course , sir , I'll have a look in the back .
__label__noemo	First of all , thank you for accepting this job .
__label__noemo	it's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz .
__label__noemo	Why not ? China is a wonderful country .
__label__joy	Happy New Year !
__label__surprise	You know you shouldn't say that at a time like this .
__label__noemo	That ’ s really a let-down .
__label__joy	Let's see . Have you been to a jazz club yet ?
__label__noemo	No , thanks . Just let me sleep until I wake up .
__label__noemo	Look , there is traffic accident over there .
__label__noemo	Yes . Here's a quarter . I flip it , you call it in the air .
__label__noemo	It's in the hall on the first floor .
__label__sadness	My daughter . She is missing . I don ’ t know where she is .
__label__noemo	I've actually been busy lately .
__label__anger	Come on ! We have been here for almost an hour ! I thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish !
__label__noemo	They usually taste sweet , but they remind me of an orange .
__label__noemo	She is going to get married .
__label__noemo	What color do you want ?
__label__noemo	Well , you have to get 166 credits , including required courses and optional courses .
__label__noemo	Have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals .
__label__noemo	How much duty should I pay ?
__label__noemo	Not a problem . The number is 626-555-1739 .
__label__noemo	Yeah , Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate .
__label__noemo	How do you like your steaks ?
__label__noemo	I have and I can prove that is 100 % true for you .
__label__noemo	Well , let's shake on that and draw up the details of the contract .
__label__joy	That would be nice . Can you read the characters ?
__label__noemo	No . Forget about it . It's not important .
__label__noemo	Good evening , sir .
__label__noemo	it's a kind of rice ball that is made in Malaysia . What about you ?
__label__noemo	That'll be fine .
__label__noemo	Hi , Steven .
__label__noemo	Why don't you have any money for another bus ?
__label__noemo	At least you know what American women generally like in a man .
__label__noemo	But I thought this was the right bus to go to Washington Square Park .
__label__noemo	$ 50 .
__label__noemo	How do you like your steak ?
__label__noemo	Well , you are right on that point . This is the reason that I don ’ t buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products .
__label__noemo	10:00 a . m . When am I supposed to check in ?
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	I'm trying to turn it on , but it won't work .
__label__noemo	Sure . Show me your receipt , please .
__label__joy	I was really glad to hear about your promotion . Congratulations !
__label__noemo	I'm David , Joanna's husband . She has to be at work late today . So she asked me to pick you up here .
__label__noemo	I ’ m getting this beret – doesn ’ t it look cool ? I ’ d like to get some jeans too , but I don ’ t have enough cash on me .
__label__noemo	Ok . Ask away .
__label__noemo	I think so .
__label__noemo	Hello . Welcome !
__label__noemo	OK . Oh , how much do you make at your current job , if you don ’ t mind my asking ?
__label__noemo	I want to buy some jewellery .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t worry , you can pay in an installment , that is to say , you don ’ t have to pay the whole amount of money at once .
__label__noemo	Good ! But also , write off the bed you want to tell them the reason of your writing , give them more reference .
__label__joy	you are welcome .
__label__noemo	Must I stop all my training ? Will I be able to attend the games ?
__label__noemo	What ?
__label__noemo	Are you ready for a second ?
__label__noemo	I didn ’ t know you were taking any kind of class . Tell me about it .
__label__noemo	Oh , my jump rope . Mom , can you get it for me ?
__label__noemo	When I ’ m old , I ’ ll also be like that .
__label__noemo	Talk it easy , Anna . You really don't hate me . do you ?
__label__noemo	How are your typing and shorthand skills ?
__label__joy	I have a sweet tooth . Chocolate is my favorite . So how about you ?
__label__noemo	The money goes in the slot over there . It has to be smooth to go in .
__label__joy	I'll get my things and meet you there .
__label__noemo	Actually , we are famous for our Cuervo Gold margaritas .
__label__noemo	As I said , it is possible , but it would be much more expensive . I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system .
__label__noemo	Don't believe him.He ' s a liar .
__label__noemo	I have an opening . Do you have an add sheet for me to sign ?
__label__noemo	Don't be too critical.We can't expect it to be perfect .
__label__noemo	We can figure that out right now . How much do you earn annually ?
__label__noemo	What do you do on that day ?
__label__noemo	I worked as a personnel manager in a state-owned company , and then I transferred to joint venture as a sales manager . So I am familiar with the food market in China .
__label__noemo	But Ben is not a bad man . I know him from A to Z .
__label__noemo	I'll have an application form with me . You can fill it out if you're interested .
__label__noemo	You're not coming ?
__label__noemo	It's 212-331-7600 .
__label__noemo	Why don't you take a taxi ? It'll get you there much faster .
__label__noemo	Every time I try to start this program , the computer freezes .
__label__noemo	Yes , here it is . That's received and cleared , so it's available for withdrawal .
__label__noemo	Well , good luck . Give me a ring sometime , and let me know how you are .
__label__sadness	Sorry , but I'm on my way out now.Could you come back in an hour ?
__label__anger	You shouldn't have told her the truth.What can we do now ?
__label__noemo	Can we sit on the grass , darling ?
__label__noemo	How's your work ?
__label__joy	True , and I like the kitchen . It's new and well equipped .
__label__noemo	Are they cheaper ?
__label__noemo	May I see your ID ?
__label__noemo	I'd be happy if I got a rise .
__label__noemo	Can you tell me what's the time in London ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I would .
__label__noemo	I have some . I worked in the IT department at a language school for four years in Spain .
__label__noemo	Are there any other jobs waiting for me in the future ?
__label__noemo	Then , what's your usual commission rate for your agents ?
__label__joy	Oh , I see it . Thanks for your help .
__label__joy	It look fine.Can I try it on ?
__label__joy	You'd like it .
__label__noemo	Why don't you wear purple eye shadow for a change ? We also have lipstick to go with it .
__label__anger	Well , if I'm not living here anymore , then I won't have to listen to your rules .
__label__noemo	Ok , now some points for attention . First of all , pay attention to safety ... Now , sign your names on the lab record , and after that you can start . If there is any question , just let me know .
__label__noemo	I dropped it , and the cover tore off .
__label__noemo	Thank you for letting me add your class .
__label__noemo	I think that maybe I should accept their offer .
__label__noemo	I'd like to change these dollars into RIB . Would you please tell me the exchange rate between American dollar and RIB ?
__label__noemo	Yes , but to the health , this break has long enough .
__label__noemo	I'm thinking of dropping out .
__label__joy	Thank you . I was lucky this time .
__label__noemo	Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ?
__label__noemo	So what have you been up to ?
__label__joy	We have been through this a million times ! Let ’ s get going already ! I ’ m ready !
__label__noemo	Why do you say so ? Everyone admires that you have a good wife .
__label__noemo	In fifties please .
__label__noemo	This is the White Rose Restaurant.May I help you ?
__label__noemo	You know . I really don't those big hotels .
__label__noemo	I don't know exactly . It's a tradition . Maybe it's for sanitary reasons .
__label__noemo	No , thanks . His home is not far and I can walk there .
__label__noemo	Well , I ’ Ve got some papers due .
__label__noemo	Would you and your wife care to come to our place and have tea with us some afternoon ?
__label__noemo	Turn right at the third light and then go straight for two blocks .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . Does this train go to Brooklyn ?
__label__anger	I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !
__label__joy	Next Monday is my birthday , and I would like you to attend my party .
__label__noemo	All right , David . Is this for a checkup or a cleaning ?
__label__noemo	I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .
__label__noemo	The second week of September is still in the high-season , so the cheapest tickets are $ 650 . The high season lasts until the 15th , so fares after that date are cheaper .
__label__noemo	What are you doing this weekend ?
__label__noemo	Do you import any food items ?
__label__noemo	I have learned English for 10 years , and I have passed College English test level 4 and 6 .
__label__noemo	Do we get a day off from school then ?
__label__noemo	Can ’ t you remember the days when you had the hots for me ?
__label__noemo	ok , let's go .
__label__noemo	OK . Monday is the big day for job ads .
__label__noemo	The total is 45 yuan .
__label__noemo	Not at all . Go ahead .
__label__noemo	Have you heard about the new iPhone ?
__label__noemo	It really depends on you .
__label__noemo	Doctor , I have a bad cough and a headache .
__label__noemo	How would you solve the problem ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m afraid a pencil won ’ t do . Wait a moment , I ’ ll find you one .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , can you do me a favor ?
__label__noemo	Any question about the work ?
__label__noemo	I teach at Beijing Normal University , English composition and some conversational classes .
__label__noemo	How are you going to find an apartment ?
__label__noemo	Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ?
__label__noemo	We are out at the moment . May I suggest some rye bread ?
__label__joy	I can understand . By the way , is there anyway I can help ?
__label__noemo	My new plan is to wait for the end of the sand storm and clean my apartment .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive .
__label__noemo	So the life of a cave woman was less stressful than my life ?
__label__noemo	I've asked my parents to live with us for a while , so they can look after her for me while I am at work or in the class .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes . I like to exercise . But I don ’ t watch sports or buy sports magazines . I don ’ t have much time to do those things .
__label__noemo	Actually , many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese , so they ’ re easy for me .
__label__noemo	Ever since I brought home some bad grades in elementary school , they never expected much .
__label__noemo	Well , here there are many different clubs you can get into , for free , you don't have to pay , some of them . In London it's really expensive for drinks and an entry fee .
__label__noemo	So decode this for me , Madame Psycho .
__label__noemo	Quiet color .
__label__noemo	I'm really curious . What is it like doing housework all day for a living ?
__label__noemo	I hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time .
__label__noemo	It would largely depend on the size of the order and the items you want .
__label__surprise	Oh , she sings too ?
__label__noemo	OK , it's not far from here .
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__noemo	I hope we can do more business together . Though we are satisfied with our past trade record , there are still possibilities for more business . In the meantime , let's discuss other spheres of cooperation , such as investment , technology transfer and technical assistance .
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	It's 10 yuan . How much money do you want to deposit ?
__label__noemo	I failed in my computer course once and I made up my mind to learn it well . Then I made painstaking preparation for 3 months and I finally got it .
__label__noemo	No , I don ’ t . I get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients .
__label__noemo	Yes , he's 6 feet tall , 200 pounds , black hair , and about 30 years old .
__label__noemo	Can't you give me a warning ?
__label__noemo	Can I borrow these magazines ?
__label__noemo	I study the administration.Yes.But I'm more attracted to writing articles . I want to use my knowledge of business to write financial news .
__label__noemo	The facial will start with thorough cleansing .
__label__noemo	Good day . How can we assist you ?
__label__noemo	It is cold on the mountain . Have you packed the windshelled clothes and bodywarmers ?
__label__noemo	Even in Taiwan , I always liked to take the train . It is more comfortable .
__label__noemo	We do have a souvenir shop on the first floor , sir .
__label__noemo	How's your new car ?
__label__noemo	How about going there to have a look now ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s a skill . What can I say ? I don ’ t know why , I just have a long routine .
__label__noemo	Yeah , fine . And dressing leather shoes .
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? No wonder that she looks quite depressed recently .
__label__noemo	What do you have in foundation ?
__label__joy	Sure . I love this place , especially the decoration . So tasteful !
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry , sir . I ’ m going to have to take a look inside your bag .
__label__noemo	You have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 .
__label__noemo	Hm ... I think you ' Ve got the flu .
__label__noemo	So , Casey , how are things going with the photos for the press kit ?
__label__noemo	Even though you are only twelve , it ’ s not too early to start saving a little money .
__label__joy	Mr . Wilson , here's a present for you .
__label__joy	Sure.She is a peaceful child .
__label__joy	Great ! I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers .
__label__noemo	All right . I ’ ll repair them for you .
__label__noemo	I hope not . We are getting closer .. two more ... one more ... it's our turn .
__label__noemo	Hi , are you Catherine ?
__label__noemo	so did i . I ran the ideas by a few people before the meeting and their ideas seemed to have the supports of some people .
__label__noemo	Would you like something to drink ?
__label__noemo	Dear , can you drive me to the clinic ?
__label__noemo	You're not going to get up in five minutes if I let you fall back asleep .
__label__noemo	Oh , sure , I understand . I'd be happy to send you a promotional packet about the programs that I think might best suit a company of your size . Would it be okay if I called again to see if you have any questions ?
__label__noemo	We guarantee our product for two years .
__label__noemo	If you hire me , I'll start studying Spanish again .
__label__noemo	Doctor , what are some things I can do to stay as healthy as I can be ?
__label__sadness	Sorry , madam . We have stopped selling those kinds of eggs for a week .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit .
__label__noemo	But Sandra ... you love your job ! You spent months trying to get this position . It's perfect for you !
__label__noemo	You may keep it for the time being . I'm not using it now .
__label__noemo	All right . Here are our F . O . B . price lists . All the prices are subject to our final confirmation .
__label__joy	I will . Thank you for all .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , I must have been confused . I had thought it's C section , but actually it's D section . I'll move my car right away .
__label__noemo	Okay , give me a week and I'll have time to get my pencil real sharp . I should have some new figures from Malaysia by then .
__label__noemo	I will . I want to write the first draft tonight.So I could bring it tomorrow morning .
__label__noemo	Three times a day after meals .
__label__joy	not only our annual sales brake a record , but our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well . After a two-year slump , we finally back in the black .
__label__joy	It does seem like the perfect day ! I ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! This looks like the perfect spot ! Ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up ca
__label__noemo	Of course they are .
__label__joy	Congratulations !
__label__noemo	I ’ m fine , Celia . And you ?
__label__noemo	Some people believe that a tough approach is better . Other prefer a more lenient approach .
__label__noemo	no , I didn ’ t . I gave them a really good clean , so they just look new . The worktop was in poor condition , so I had a new one added .
__label__noemo	Do you have anything do declare ?
__label__noemo	How did your vacation go ?
__label__noemo	What's the matter with you , Paul ?
__label__noemo	Good afternoon , sir . Can I help you ?
__label__sadness	He never came .
__label__noemo	I need to return these books .
__label__noemo	Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .
__label__noemo	I had no idea that I ran it .
__label__noemo	Today's her birthday and she told me she wants me to buy her flowers .
__label__joy	Quite satisfied . I'm looking forward to our future cooperation .
__label__noemo	No problem .
__label__noemo	Dad , come on ! Just tell me .
__label__noemo	2244 Forest Drive .
__label__noemo	I can ’ t go any higher than $ 850 .
__label__noemo	I am sorry , sir.All the tickets have been sold out .
__label__noemo	Yes . Can you tell him Bob White called ?
__label__surprise	What ? I only stayed three nights .
__label__noemo	Sales have been exceptionally good during the past twelve months .
__label__joy	Right . That's good .
__label__noemo	What number is the suspect ?
__label__noemo	There aren't many places that sell used things in Taiwan , besides auction websites .
__label__noemo	I really should be on my way .
__label__joy	Here are all kinds of jades . Choose whatever you like , please .
__label__noemo	You need to stop smoking , and make sure that you get 30 minutes of exercise every day .
__label__noemo	Would you please let the next applicant come in on your way out ?
__label__noemo	When is the place available ?
__label__joy	We thought it would be fun to have a pool party at Jay's house .
__label__joy	I'm glad you came . I hope you enjoyed it .
__label__noemo	Could you please help me to check out the book ?
__label__noemo	A deposit , huh ? I would think my baggage would be enough of a deposit .
__label__joy	That's so sweet of you . We definitely want it .
__label__noemo	What would you like to eat ?
__label__noemo	Can I wear T-shirt and jeans for the job interview ?
__label__fear	No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood .
__label__noemo	Well , it has to be cheap . I don't want a really expensive apartment .
__label__noemo	Room service.What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I do . You can buy a bus schedule in a news stand .
__label__joy	Well , I think I want to order the new Accord then.It looks like an excellent car .
__label__noemo	Hi Steve . This is Mike . What are you doing ?
__label__noemo	Let me examine you . Don't worry . It's nothing serious .
__label__joy	Okay .
__label__noemo	Can you help me figure out how to use this vending machine ?
__label__noemo	Yeah of course ! Although , don ’ t you ever wonder what could have been ?
__label__noemo	What is your major ?
__label__noemo	stirred will be fine .
__label__noemo	Turn right at the second crossing and then go straight for two blocks .
__label__noemo	What'd he do ?
__label__noemo	Do you bring some gifts along ?
__label__joy	I'm so glad you like it .
__label__noemo	May I have your name and room number ?
__label__noemo	I see . Is that all there is to it ?
__label__noemo	Hi David , this is Marge . Can you meet me after work for a few minutes ?
__label__noemo	relationships can be confusing sometimes .
__label__joy	Wonderful . I ’ m so excited .
__label__joy	Roger Vargas is up at bat . The pitcher winds up and strike one !
__label__noemo	That ’ s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ’ s like we went back in time !
__label__noemo	Yes . If you undertake additional courses , provided these are approved , and you complete them successfully , you can claim back part , quite a large part , 75 % of the costs you incurred . Not just the fees , - traveling and other expenses too .
__label__noemo	How about your other siblings ? Do they spend a lot of time with your parents ?
__label__noemo	01088256798
__label__surprise	My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ?
__label__noemo	Then , Do you know her younger sister ?
__label__noemo	Hello . May I help you ?
__label__noemo	No , I'm not asking for money . I'm asking for your advice .
__label__joy	Yes , I ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction .
__label__noemo	Is the Chinese team taking the lead ?
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__noemo	Galileo is one of them .
__label__noemo	One last thing . Is it waterproof ?
__label__noemo	So what's the movie about ?
__label__joy	I see.Thank you .
__label__noemo	Eight hundred and fifty yuan .
__label__noemo	That's because you are always fixing your eyes on the bald .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , driver , where is the main area for restaurants ?
__label__noemo	oh , there is a supermarket not far from here . But there is also a tea house around the corner , where you can get tea and a tea set as well .
__label__noemo	How about your appetite ?
__label__noemo	He's a very nice person . We will all miss him .
__label__noemo	I'd love to help you out , but I'm a bit short on cash this month as well . I had to get a new engine put into my car , and that ate up my savings .
__label__noemo	We have thought of you very carefully , but the other candidate has more experience .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'd like to make an appointment to see the doctor . My name is Randy Horn .
__label__noemo	Please , call my John . Well , there ’ s a subway stop and bus station just around the corner . Do you have children ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to have lunch in my room .
__label__noemo	I left the job because of expiry of my employment contract . Besides I have accumulated a lot of experience in this sort of job . I want to seek better jobs .
__label__noemo	Not a sound on the city streets , just the beat of my own heart , I think that ’ s how it goes , something like that .
__label__noemo	Yes . But he doesn't care . I really wouldn't want to move , but I simply can ’ t stand him .
__label__noemo	I am sorry.The flight is late.Please go to the waiting room for further notice .
__label__noemo	Yes , please . We need a record of you education and your work experiences .
__label__joy	Sure . I'll be back in a minute .
__label__noemo	What happened ?
__label__noemo	Jack wonders whether Linda likes him or not .
__label__noemo	Do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation ?
__label__noemo	It's not only the name of our company that will change ... I expect that after this acquisition , there'll be a ton of things up in the air .
__label__noemo	Really ? What jobs are they ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s a job that pays well . If you ’ re lucky , you might have opportunities to travel as well . Have you applied to any banks yet ? Our course will end soon .
__label__noemo	Let ’ s see ... If I won the lottery , I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world .
__label__noemo	Definitely not , sir .
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__noemo	Well , I need a Deposit Certification to handle this .
__label__noemo	No problem . Your ticket is for Trans Pacific Flight 87 from Detroit to Beijing at 3 forty p . m . on April 13 . You will arrive at Beijing International Airport at six 35 p . m . on April 14 . Your electronic
__label__noemo	You have a colorful life .
__label__noemo	I'm free on Sunday . I'd like to take a look in Beijing City , could you tell me where to go ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I'm not certain , but I think I've lost it .
__label__noemo	Grant . How is everything ?
__label__noemo	That's good .
__label__noemo	Are you ready to transfer to a new school tomorrow ?
__label__joy	Yes , thank you . That would be great .
__label__noemo	Well , it has a cassette record ... a cassette tape .
__label__noemo	Yes . Once it gets hot , put a little oil in it , add the vegetables and stir-fry them for a few minutes .
__label__noemo	Nothing ' doing .
__label__joy	At 6 o'clock .
__label__noemo	how long do you want to sign a contract for ?
__label__noemo	What's her outlook ?
__label__noemo	The secret is persistence .
__label__noemo	That restaurant has six parking spaces .
__label__noemo	Step out of the vehicle , please . Sir , what do you have in the back ?
__label__joy	Good luck !
__label__joy	Congratulations ! So , have you started planning your move ?
__label__noemo	I need it for the parking meter .
__label__noemo	Anything else ?
__label__noemo	How about some dumplings ? I just can't get enough of them .
__label__noemo	No . Could you tell me something more about it ? I want to play well .
__label__noemo	He is cute . What dose he do ?
__label__noemo	I think it ’ s fairly useful , but there are two big problems . First , a lot of the information you find online is false . Second , when you buy something online , you don ’ t see it until you actually get it .
__label__noemo	Boy , you've got such a crush on her , haven't you ?
__label__noemo	I like it so far . My classes are pretty good right now .
__label__noemo	I want to apply my knowledge and experience to a challenging position and finally move on to management level .
__label__noemo	What kind of ground beef do you need ?
__label__anger	Oh , come on , Gordon , it's the afternoon now . Why were you late really ?
__label__noemo	Sure . I teach history in a university . Have you heard of Dong-Hai University ?
__label__noemo	Hello , I am Mr . Johnson at room 309 . I would like to have a safe box . Do I need to pay for a safe box ?
__label__noemo	Well , Mr . Parsons , I am flexible when it comes to salary . The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me .
__label__noemo	Yes , we do , debit or credit ?
__label__joy	Absolutely ! Everything that ’ s thrilling turns me on .
__label__noemo	Your daughter . She sold it at the school auction .
__label__noemo	I am volunteering for the campaign .
__label__joy	thanks , that was nice of you .
__label__noemo	What is your date of birth ?
__label__noemo	Hold on , before you kick your car let ’ s go through some possible problems .
__label__noemo	That is our office block . We have all the administrative depart - ments there . Down there is the research and development section .
__label__noemo	Get in , please . Where to , madam ?
__label__noemo	As we are a well-established company , we are very familiar with the customers ' needs . Besides , we can make full use of our good connections with the wholesalers and retailers here and develop a good market for your products if appointed as your agent .
__label__joy	That sounds ideal .
__label__noemo	What do you like to do in your spare time ?
__label__noemo	In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls .
__label__noemo	The style is all right , but I'm not sure about the color . Let me think for a while .
__label__noemo	Can I pay by private check ?
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve been thinking of doing that lately ! I don ’ t want some banker to run off with my money !
__label__noemo	Good luck !
__label__noemo	I just want a light wave . I look really silly if my hair is too curly .
__label__noemo	you're the first guest to arrive . I'll just put your coat away and then I'll get you something to drink .
__label__joy	Jane . Nice to meet you .
__label__noemo	They don't have a lot of organic foods there .
__label__noemo	Sorry , it's not available now . Anything else ?
__label__noemo	The time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
__label__joy	my pleasure , and have a good time !
__label__noemo	Probably we can put one on that counter . And we can put one on the floor by the bed . Over there .
__label__noemo	Oh , I was out sick most of last week . I ’ m still not completely over it . You ’ d better not get too close !
__label__noemo	They always eat spaghetti and drink wine , don't they ?
__label__joy	I miss you too . Tell me where you like to do the next day .
__label__noemo	We ’ re going to the bookshop . Would you like to join us ?
__label__surprise	seriously ? But you are such a genius .
__label__noemo	Welcome to Bill ’ s Fabric World . What can I do for you today ?
__label__noemo	I would like to make a reservation for tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Oh , I remember . It was about 10 o'clock . When I was about to go to bed , suddenly I heard help outside .
__label__noemo	Wow ! I didn't notice the time.It ' s almost noon . I have to get home .
__label__joy	If there's anything that I can help you in the future , please let me know .
__label__noemo	Because I won't let it fail .
__label__noemo	Very well .
__label__noemo	Sorry , but no jeans here .
__label__noemo	My father and sister are out to photographing . What about you ?
__label__noemo	have you been drinking plenty of water ?
__label__noemo	Anything else ?
__label__noemo	No problem .
__label__joy	I'm looking forward to summer vacation .
__label__noemo	That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .
__label__noemo	Dad , I ’ d like to borrow some money .
__label__noemo	I ’ d prefer to see him asap . If I have to wait for another 30 mins , I think I will faint from this unbearable pain in my stomach and ...
__label__noemo	Do you have anything to declare ?
__label__noemo	Why aren't you doing well in the class ?
__label__noemo	Just a minute . Here's your change .
__label__noemo	Two tickets , please . How much are they ?
__label__noemo	Remember it is the boss who hires you and tell her how much you have improved the office efficiency .
__label__sadness	Oh my god . Please save her life .
__label__noemo	You are still a student ?
__label__noemo	Just a moment , please . Oh , yes . One twin and one single . Is that right ?
__label__surprise	That ’ s crazy !
__label__noemo	Excuse me , can you tell me where is the taxi stand ?
__label__noemo	It's an e-mail . It says , We need to meet . I'll give you a sweet treat . It's not what you think .
__label__noemo	Can I just do it here ?
__label__noemo	It's a scam 7 that's based on a hierarchy , like a pyramid . The person at the top asks the people below him for money , and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him .
__label__noemo	If I need to know the price , I ’ ll just look at the label .
__label__noemo	How about drink ?
__label__joy	Of course .
__label__joy	Well , I just wanted to say well done . Really you did a great job .
__label__noemo	We have a lot of other applicants for this position . Why do you think that you deserve to get the job ?
__label__noemo	Certainly .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . Nature calls .
__label__noemo	Um , this steak , I asked for to be medium rare .
__label__noemo	I have not given it much thought . Do you have any good suggestions ?
__label__noemo	I love this house and would be willing to pay the full asking price of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars .
__label__noemo	How can I help you ?
__label__noemo	1 % ? That ’ s too low a rate . Could you see your way to increase it to 2 % ? .
__label__noemo	hey , the new SOHO . How's everything going ?
__label__noemo	Hello , Becky . Well , you see , I have this thing here , called a Fixed Deposit Certificate , and I've just noticed the date on it .
__label__noemo	If I can improve my vertical jump a few more inches , I think beach volleyball might be my ticket .
__label__noemo	I appreciate you saying that and would like you to join us in our meeting .
__label__joy	Thank you . Oh , it's very delicious .
__label__joy	I can still remember our first date .
__label__noemo	I'm not sure.Medium , I suppose.Maybe a little on the heavy side .
__label__noemo	I graduated from Hebes University .
__label__surprise	I can ’ t believe that Anthony is finally getting married !
__label__noemo	what I have to give you a hospital for an ex-treat .
__label__noemo	That's for sure .
__label__noemo	it was really busy . I had to work straight through my lunch break .
__label__noemo	Of course . As for an entry-level accountant , we pay ¥ 1,500 a month in the first half year . We have a grading system to evaluate your work . If you have made progress , we will certainly raise your salary . For beginners with a CPA certificate , they can earn at least ¥ 2 , 000 a month .
__label__noemo	Hello . Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	So what ?
__label__noemo	True . True .
__label__noemo	Get in . I will take you there .
__label__noemo	It would be nice to go to the beach sometime this weekend .
__label__noemo	The interview will take about 15 minutes , and your phone will be turned on in 24 hours .
__label__joy	You do have great taste . That's the most expensive stuff here .
__label__noemo	Would you like a drink ?
__label__noemo	And do you have any medicine for air sickness ?
__label__noemo	Yes , that ’ s right . But I had no idea I would be charged for all this . Thank goodness my company will let me reimburse all this .
__label__noemo	What about the afternoon ?
__label__noemo	Why don ’ t you run off with him ? What are you waiting for ?
__label__noemo	Sounds good . I think I'll have the lamb for my main course . What does it come with ?
__label__joy	We'll do the seaweed wrap , the jet bath , and the foot massage .
__label__noemo	What happened ?
__label__noemo	Take the number 5 train and get off at the United Squire .
__label__noemo	If you could show me your details , please . What can I do ?
__label__noemo	Yes . These hobbies have indeed enriched my life
__label__noemo	That's tough indeed ! Do you think your health can afford ?
__label__noemo	Not so well . To be honest with you , I broke up with Tom .
__label__noemo	I'll take home economics .
__label__noemo	Don't worry about it . Try to look on the bright sight of things .
__label__noemo	Don't rub it in . Where am I going to put this huge thing ?
__label__noemo	Would you like to apply for one right now ?
__label__noemo	Well , could you let me see the room ?
__label__noemo	Mrs . White .
__label__noemo	Where does she live ?
__label__noemo	Mr Moon , how good to see you again .
__label__noemo	I think the job should make use of the professional experience I have obtained , and offer me opportunity for advancement .
__label__joy	Thank you , David .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I am of the same opinion .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I can't cook anything until tomorrow , anyway . Let's go to the restaurant nearby . It's my treat .
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__joy	Wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . I really like it . That is so nice of you .
__label__noemo	It is a little high . I'm told that your hotel is offering discount now .
__label__noemo	We are sorry , but single rooms have been occupied .
__label__joy	Smells good ! What ’ s for breakfast ?
__label__noemo	I like to live here and enjoy my neighbors ' company . And I don't think I should waste money just because I have much of it .
__label__noemo	Very well . You will need some stamps for the postcards and I need to weigh that package .
__label__joy	Let's have pumpkin pie .
__label__noemo	Everyone should be able to love who they want .
__label__joy	Oh , hi Lucas , come on in . I'm Barbara . Nice to meet you .
__label__noemo	So I will cut the sides just above the ear . Is that good ?
__label__noemo	Have you ever been there ?
__label__noemo	Okay , Miss .
__label__noemo	My income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .
__label__noemo	Here ’ s your hot dog and beer . What happened ? Did I miss anything ?
__label__noemo	Interpersonal and technical skills .
__label__noemo	sure . I ’ m open to any reasonable suggestions .
__label__noemo	I only have my household register .
__label__joy	That's my cousin Hubert . He likes smiling .
__label__joy	I love Japan a lot .
__label__noemo	You know , I'm a compulsive overeater . I got to watch what I eat .
__label__noemo	Hello !
__label__noemo	Make it 4
__label__noemo	let's hope so .
__label__noemo	Would you rather stay home ?
__label__noemo	Which tooth is it ?
__label__noemo	I really like it here so far .
__label__noemo	Am I going to be charged extra for using the gym ?
__label__noemo	When exactly does the party start ?
__label__noemo	Thanks .
__label__noemo	Apparently forced entry . The lock is battered to pieces .
__label__joy	Typical you , always wanting to keep the best things for yourself . The more I appreciate the gift now .
__label__noemo	Hi ! Crenshaw and Hawthorne , at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner .
__label__joy	Yeah , I went over the figures this morning . We're finally started making money again !
__label__disgust	To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck !
__label__noemo	I don't really need five .
__label__noemo	Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally .
__label__noemo	Oh , Brian . That ’ s really sweet of you guys . I would love to get together with all of you . How about Friday ?
__label__noemo	Well , the color is all right . But it looks outdated.Can you show me that one ?
__label__noemo	Two slices of whole wheat bread and one cup of coffee .
__label__surprise	Good gracious . That ’ s incredible !
__label__noemo	You should never open a door without looking to see who it is .
__label__joy	Oh , Jack , you deserve it.You ' Ve been working so hard .
__label__joy	It's really good .
__label__noemo	I see . You are in luck this month because all of our models are on sale ! it is a perfect time to buy a new car since it ’ s the end of the year .
__label__joy	Thanks . You too .
__label__noemo	It seems that it is a key department for providing materials and transportation .
__label__noemo	Shoes ? You already have a closet full of shoes .
__label__anger	I never went to court .
__label__noemo	And does Rocky drive a truck , too ?
__label__surprise	Really ? I thought he loved his wife very much .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__noemo	A taxi will be here in just a minute , sir .
__label__noemo	I'd like to have red cooked sea cucumber .
__label__noemo	You can't help learning when you're using it all day.You ' ll see . A few weeks ' study in the school will have a similar effect on you .
__label__noemo	Say , what's your favorite sport ?
__label__noemo	how late were you ?
__label__noemo	Where have you put it ?
__label__noemo	Yes . How are the Spanish classes going ?
__label__noemo	Hello , madam . Where to ?
__label__noemo	My date is quite sophisticated . She would expect nothing less than the best .
__label__noemo	Hmm , how about seven ? I can treat you to dinner .
__label__noemo	You would have to order in excess of 10,000 units to be eligible .
__label__noemo	Maintaining basic health and safety standards is your responsibility .
__label__noemo	You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision .
__label__noemo	It varies from time to time.At present it is 6 % .
__label__noemo	Sure , no problem . What are you trying to get ?
__label__noemo	What ’ s going to be covered in the orientation ?
__label__noemo	Hello . This is John ’ s Distribution . Can I help you ?
__label__joy	It will give us better feeling and atmosphere if it rains .
__label__noemo	It's 7500 yuan per square meter , and I really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room . Its total area is about 80 square meters .
__label__noemo	What's the problem ?
__label__joy	( ha ha ) I ’ ll keep that in mind , but don ’ t tell my husband .
__label__noemo	It's chilly outside , so don't forget to put on your jacket .
__label__noemo	Could you tell me something about investment environment of your country ?
__label__noemo	Aisle , please .
__label__noemo	Sure , would you like any appetizers today ?
__label__noemo	I prefer the British paper , but I'll read whatever one you aren't going to read right away .
__label__noemo	OK , do you know what kind of food will be served ?
__label__noemo	Green beans . They pop and turn brown when you roast them .
__label__noemo	Oh . It ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped .
__label__noemo	How ?
__label__noemo	Nice choice .
__label__noemo	Actually , I think the paper-cuts is OK , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . They think that is a miracle .
__label__noemo	Hey , I know what that's like . I bought a BMW on my Visa card . Now the payments really hurt .
__label__noemo	It's $ 308 a night .
__label__noemo	Thank you . I didn't think it would be this simple .
__label__noemo	I ’ m pretty sure that Jim will turn out to be a good lawyer .
__label__noemo	No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ?
__label__joy	That sounds like a good deal .
__label__noemo	Sometimes you can save money and you can find things that you had difficulty finding in a store . sometimes it's just convenient , like doing it late at night and sometimes it's just fun .
__label__noemo	I like neither .
__label__noemo	No , we are just too different . This isn ’ t working .
__label__noemo	sure . We should probably pre-heat the oven right away , too .
__label__noemo	You mean we can't just buy curtains already made ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about that . I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline .
__label__noemo	What is your complaint about ?
__label__joy	I certainly am . I would have been very disappointed if I hadn ’ t got them .
__label__noemo	But this time I ’ m going to stick to it . I really mean it ! Trust me , Carol , I ’ m going to be a new man in one year ’ s time !
__label__noemo	He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .
__label__anger	I don't know what to do about the people who live in the flat above me !
__label__noemo	I found a few pairs of pants .
__label__noemo	No , of course not . Just in case . Nothing to worry about . Don't you also do this in China ?
__label__joy	On the fourth day , we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic . And no stomach problems .
__label__noemo	That's a reasonable price .
__label__noemo	Yes . I'd like a hamburger and a large order of french fries , please .
__label__joy	Yes , please . That is very kind of you .
__label__noemo	That's fate .
__label__joy	Oh , thank you .
__label__noemo	Did you have a better price in mind ?
__label__noemo	It's expensive for me .
__label__joy	Well , it looks great from the curb . Let ’ s go on inside .
__label__noemo	It is true . I think we should change some policies .
__label__noemo	Where are you from , Ms.Baker ?
__label__noemo	You sit in there , listen to the morning announcement with other kids , and then you go to your classes .
__label__noemo	For real ?
__label__noemo	Tell him to call me tomorrow morning .
__label__noemo	oh , hi Lucas , come on in . I'm Barbara . Nice to meet you .
__label__joy	Tell me about it , will you ?
__label__noemo	Ann , do you have time next Monday ?
__label__noemo	Hey man ! How ’ s it hanging ?
__label__noemo	OK !
__label__noemo	Fine , but it cannot happen again if you want an “ A ” in the class .
__label__joy	Thank you for your compliment.Won ' t you try this fish with white sauce ? I'm rather round of it .
__label__noemo	I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not .
__label__joy	That sounds nice . Where did you go ?
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__noemo	Martha . What's wrong ? Why are you crying ?
__label__noemo	I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday .
__label__noemo	Have you ever climbed the mountain before ?
__label__noemo	The heart !
__label__noemo	Check the drawer .
__label__fear	Security , Dan , security ! You can never be too safe you know ! A lot of sickos out there . Just the other day they caught that peeping tom red handed ! Had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window .
__label__noemo	Each night costs 320 RIB , but for a four night stay , we can offer a discount of 15 % .
__label__joy	Yes , I am seven . I am a big girl now .
__label__noemo	Well , I won ’ t put a crime into their doings .
__label__noemo	oh , that's exciting . What's this guy like ? Is he hot ?
__label__noemo	well then , this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . I bet you'd love it .
__label__noemo	Well , I was going to drive to Birmingham to see some friends .
__label__noemo	The other class is on Monday and Wednesday from 10 am - 12 .
__label__noemo	The headlines are all about the presidential election in the united states . Few other stories made the front pages .
__label__noemo	Oh , I know . I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus 5 and some students trying to imitate you .
__label__noemo	You should do sports to keep young .
__label__noemo	I know . i could not believe it when i got hit by that storm.it was pouring with rain all afternoon .
__label__noemo	But for an enterprise of your size , an order from us will certainly not embarrass you financially .
__label__joy	Darlene ! Indeed , it ’ s been a while ! How have you been ? Wow , you look amazing ! I love what you ’ Ve done with your hair !
__label__noemo	All right , but would you be so kind as to make up your mind soon ? We're very busy just now as you can see , sir .
__label__noemo	Of course , it ’ s not polite of them , but sometimes you should put things the other way round and try to understand them .
__label__noemo	I ’ m not going to tell you .
__label__noemo	I thought we could turn the upstairs study into a baby room . What do you think about lavender ?
__label__noemo	Take me to the airport , please .
__label__noemo	I studied economics , I am especially interested in the economic development of China .
__label__noemo	Please wait a moment ... here is the bill . Please check it .
__label__noemo	Here , sir . Sit down in this wheel chair .
__label__noemo	Sure , we have both skirts and slacks that will go well with the sweater . I especially like this flowery skirt . It's very much in style this year .
__label__joy	Well , really ! That was wonderful ! I felt no pain at all . Thank you , doctor .
__label__noemo	A minute , please . It's 6212 yuan all together . Tax included .
__label__noemo	I get home pretty late , around midnight .
__label__noemo	But the bank should be closed so we shouldn't to be able to get any money .
__label__noemo	Yes . What's your size ?
__label__noemo	The museums are excellent . And the shopping ! Well ! I'm sure you'll spend a lot of money there .
__label__noemo	That's true .
__label__joy	No need for that . It's not usually busy on weekdays .
__label__noemo	She already bought that evening gown .
__label__joy	No , not really . Just bring yourselves . We would like to your presence .
__label__noemo	Do you know what package you want to get ?
__label__noemo	In 1978 . I went to college here .
__label__noemo	Is there a bonus system or any other incentive plan in place ?
__label__noemo	well , I spend a lot of time watching movies .
__label__noemo	And what did the program say ?
__label__noemo	What's the specialty of the house ?
__label__noemo	Why not ?
__label__noemo	Do you like reading books ?
__label__noemo	It was me . I am so sorry .
__label__noemo	How can I avoid injuring myself during exercise ?
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	You should emphasize fresh fruits and vegetables , along with whole grains and protein .
__label__noemo	What sort of things are you interested in ?
__label__noemo	I think you probably know China has adopted a flexible policy in her foreign trade .
__label__noemo	Even you can bargain with the owner of one on-line store , although he or she provides ' But It Now ' prices .
__label__noemo	Hello , Lucy . This is Monica again . I have a question .
__label__noemo	I think we should buy some souvenirs to take home .
__label__noemo	Well , probably . Probably you will have to wait in line if you don't have tickets .
__label__noemo	Oh Jackie ? We broke up last week .
__label__noemo	Here is the 6,100 RIB .
__label__noemo	I see , Mr . Baker . How many people are you planning to invite and how much would you like to spend per person ?
__label__noemo	In Boston .
__label__noemo	Dad and mom ?
__label__noemo	Ah ... I see .
__label__noemo	Hi , Michelle . Do you need to use the photocopier ?
__label__noemo	What symptoms does he have ?
__label__noemo	How time flies ! Now you are a college student out of a little girl .
__label__joy	That's great to hear .
__label__noemo	I know that it ’ s going around the dorms .
__label__noemo	She did last time .
__label__noemo	Abby Park Hotel . Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	You need to fix it .
__label__noemo	Of course . Can I have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon ?
__label__noemo	Unfortunately not .
__label__noemo	Thank you . Nice to meet you too . I'm John . Is this your first time to take a long-distance trip on plane ?
__label__noemo	Well , it's a secret .
__label__noemo	Sure , he is a soccer star .
__label__joy	I am glad I did not drive a car .
__label__sadness	I did . But I am so depressed because there is nobody that will help me .
__label__noemo	Thank you , would you hang up and wait ?
__label__noemo	That's right . This entrance is for even numbers . That entrance over there is for odd numbers . Let's go over there .
__label__noemo	I'd like to order dinner .
__label__noemo	Plead your case .
__label__noemo	Poor Ann . She did not love her husband at all .
__label__noemo	You look hot and tired . Jack , have you been exercising ?
__label__noemo	Well , what would you suggest ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it is .
__label__noemo	How soon can you begin working for us ?
__label__noemo	May I have your name ?
__label__noemo	Surely of course . Give me your card please .
__label__noemo	Please have a seat . I know our employment officer has already given you the information about your employee contract , but I ’ d like to go over the main details again before signing the contract . First , you ’ ll be getting a monthly salary , with one month paid vacation after one year of service . No probation is involved .
__label__noemo	Your job includes paper filing a lot . Anc you will have to check and fill the stationer cabinet regularly . Besides , you have to reserve the meeting room in advance if the are any important visitors .
__label__noemo	It's 5:30 by my watch .
__label__noemo	That man's really a bore to me .
__label__joy	I enjoyed talking to you .
__label__surprise	My birthday ? I forgot it , Thank you for remembering my birthday .
__label__noemo	You can have Saturdays and Sundays off . In addition , you may have a paid month vacation every year . But when it is necessary , we do expect you to work overtime . Does it suit you ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I see .
__label__noemo	Couldn't you extend the delivery period by two weeks ? That would make things much easier for us .
__label__noemo	No . You can go to the Bank of China to exchange some US dollars at the current exchange rate of the day you exchange them . The maximum amount you can exchange is $ 2,000 .
__label__noemo	Are you suggesting that anyone can be ?
__label__joy	It can't be dry , and can't die .
__label__noemo	Please don't forget to say good-bye to the rest of the family for me .
__label__sadness	It's gone completely .
__label__noemo	Yes , please . How much is it ?
__label__noemo	they are all pretty easy-going . It's a very friendly place to work .
__label__noemo	I'm here for the backpack you announced several minutes ago .
__label__noemo	Someone will be up shortly with your order , sir .
__label__noemo	Yes , sir . It's one of the best beers in China .
__label__noemo	Well , I think we will order after we finish the main course .
__label__noemo	What do you plead ?
__label__noemo	I saw a vacancy board outside for assistant . Has the vacancy been filled ?
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	I'd really like to be in London , but it's the most expensive city in England to live in , so I don't know if I can afford to live there .
__label__noemo	You ’ d better , to protect your clothes . Now please watch your step .
__label__joy	I've got some great news for you !
__label__noemo	She doesn't have an ounce of fat on her face .
__label__noemo	No , thanks .
__label__noemo	Maybe you have food poisoning .
__label__joy	Yeah . I shouldn't stress about this anymore . It's not like I can do anything about it .
__label__noemo	Ok . Hope it's a pleasant trip .
__label__noemo	Thank you . Doctor .
__label__noemo	Passport , please , madam .
__label__joy	Yes , I do.That looks good . It's not too short.It ' s just right . How much do I owe you ?
__label__noemo	How much for the bus ride ?
__label__noemo	I didn't know that . How much does it cost to subscribe ?
__label__joy	You are really a good citizen .
__label__noemo	It's very simple . Divide the clothes by the colors , and wash them in cold water . If you've got some special stains on them like sugar , coffee or something else please let the dry cleaner know .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , could you please show me the way to the human resource department ?
__label__noemo	What size do you want the prints ?
__label__joy	ok . Then I can make up my mind .
__label__noemo	I went to play tennis in the public park .
__label__noemo	It ’ s alright , I will take you through the procedure . Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
__label__noemo	Never ever come to work drunk , also smoking in the office is not allowed .
__label__noemo	I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .
__label__noemo	John , do you have a minute ?
__label__joy	Me too . But anyway we hope he lives happily in the future .
__label__noemo	Yes , you may enjoy a seven-day paid holiday in the first year . After that , you can have two more days each year .
__label__noemo	Yes , they are all on the shelf .
__label__noemo	The baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces .
__label__noemo	And I don't see any loose electric wiring that could cause fires .
__label__noemo	But the importance of the export research is often neglected by the managers .
__label__noemo	I feel that history is about to be made , and I want to be a part of it .
__label__noemo	Sure . I know her elder sister Sue and younger sister Mary .
__label__noemo	Alright.Well , I'll stay here and have another coffee . Nice running into you .
__label__noemo	The Johnson are on their way back.You remember them , don't you ?
__label__noemo	And that's it . You're done .
__label__noemo	Wait a minute ! I don't like 7 fifteen , now that I think about it . Change it to 7 thirty .
__label__noemo	Yes , I can't sleep well every night .
__label__noemo	I hope we could offer the most favorable terms .
__label__noemo	Sure . But everyone loves to be beautiful . Hey , do you think this pair of sunglasses matches the handbag well ?
__label__noemo	So , what did you get them ?
__label__noemo	Is there anything wrong ?
__label__noemo	You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea .
__label__noemo	And here's mine .
__label__noemo	The main reason is the fact that you're a horrible driver .
__label__noemo	Maybe I have asking too many questions today .
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__noemo	Hey , Jane ... are you familiar with our company's insurance policies ?
__label__noemo	I beg your pardon ?
__label__noemo	Laptops are more expensive , right ?
__label__surprise	Exactly what did he do ?
__label__noemo	Your desire coincides with ours .
__label__sadness	Oh , I'm afraid I'll be busy tomorrow evening .
__label__noemo	I like playing computer games , but I'm not really into board games .
__label__noemo	If you could be ready by , say 6:30 o'clock , I'll be at the hotel to pick you up .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . My name is Richard Davis of Magic Office Supplies . I'm here to see Mr.Chen .
__label__noemo	Oh , is that right ? Is there a subway station near here ?
__label__anger	They ’ re really running you into the ground . Why don ’ t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere .
__label__noemo	Is that different from this kind of zoo ?
__label__joy	Oh , it's no problem.It ' s OK.You know , it only happened once .
__label__joy	That's very sensible . Would it be alright if I left early today to prepare for the trip ?
__label__noemo	What's the name of the girl that has just passed us ?
__label__noemo	You ’ re welcome . Could I have your name and phone number , please ?
__label__noemo	Absolutely ! We were never still for too long . But now I ’ m really looking to settle down .
__label__noemo	May I help you ?
__label__joy	I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products .
__label__noemo	But what are the sources of water pollution ?
__label__noemo	Is it Ok if I sit here ?
__label__noemo	All right . I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep .
__label__noemo	Certainly madam , what kind of coffee would you like ?
__label__noemo	Certainly , it is very nice talking with you . But I really have to go now . Catch you later .
__label__noemo	Do you want to know where I got mine from ?
__label__joy	Hello , Michael . My name's Shirley . Pleased to meet you .
__label__noemo	Yeah , do you see his Adam's apple ? It becomes bigger .
__label__noemo	Would you like to introduce me to Mr.Johnson ?
__label__joy	That ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ?
__label__noemo	Any plans tonight ?
__label__joy	That's great .
__label__surprise	There was a stop sign ?
__label__noemo	That would take care of it , thank you .
__label__noemo	I am always on the look out for such girls .
__label__noemo	Mr Edwards , this is Kristy calling from IBA .
__label__joy	My pleasure ! This tea towel ’ s a little ragged . Do you have another one ?
__label__noemo	I can ’ t give you a definite answer . Let ’ s play it by ear .
__label__noemo	Maybe you'll get another chance at the statue .
__label__noemo	If I remember correctly , it's about $ 130 .
__label__noemo	Come on . We are already here . Besides , I really wanna see this picture .
__label__noemo	I've only found a few openings in my field .
__label__noemo	Are you kidding ? The train leaves in an hour . Where did you put it ?
__label__noemo	Your husband is very helpful , isn't he ?
__label__noemo	I feel sorry for you .
__label__noemo	ha , well , we have no choice .
__label__noemo	I don't think I'm going to dream about anything . I'm really tired .
__label__noemo	No I'm not ready yet . I still have to brush my teeth and wash my face . Can you wait for a few minutes ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m not sure that ’ s a good idea .
__label__noemo	How do you like other films starring Charlie Chaplin ?
__label__joy	Okay . Enjoy your browsing .
__label__noemo	I don't think much of the film .
__label__noemo	I wrote the check out for too much .
__label__joy	Thank you . Now how much do I owe you ?
__label__noemo	Don ’ t do that . Give it to me .
__label__noemo	Oh , that's all right .
__label__noemo	Big head !
__label__noemo	Is that right ? I didn't know it .
__label__joy	I love the fresh air , the scenery the exercise , and the time to think .
__label__noemo	First please get the bill at the doctor's office , then pay it either with cash or by check . Even though you're discharged , you still need to take a rest at home . Don't hurry back to work until you have fully recovered .
__label__noemo	I am a journalist . I write for China Daily .
__label__noemo	Okay , I guess I'll cook .
__label__noemo	You gotta have some better deodorant .
__label__noemo	Get me a medium Pepsi .
__label__noemo	Have you ever written up a business plan before ?
__label__noemo	I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t you think in that case , there wouldn ’ t be so much stealing ?
__label__noemo	What was the score ?
__label__noemo	Okay , I'll do that , but my crown was just put on last year . Will my dental insurance cover the work ?
__label__noemo	Can you show me which charges you ’ re referring to ?
__label__noemo	Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry . I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter .
__label__noemo	I see . Then the basic different is , hackers build things , crackers break them .
__label__sadness	It's my girlfriend . I guess she's playing the army game .
__label__noemo	Well , as for Albert , he should go to an office supply store.There ' s a very good one called Office Depot . They have everything he will need.And their prices are good too . It's very convey
__label__noemo	It closes at six .
__label__noemo	You'll see this charge on your amenities account .
__label__noemo	Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed.And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do .
__label__noemo	How often is the bonus ?
__label__noemo	Just kidding , Mikel . Why don't you come work out with me ?
__label__noemo	Nice to meet you too .
__label__noemo	No , thanks . I've decided to give up smoking .
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	What kind of insurance could the company provide for its employees ?
__label__joy	A lot . I probably got to moonlight for the rest of my life , but so what , it ’ s worth it . Come on , get in . Let ’ s take a drive .
__label__surprise	Wow . You guys never take a break ! I want to come in and have a look at your sale . Your sale is still on , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	No.It was very close and they argued over the bid for a long time . Better luck next time .
__label__surprise	Really ? How did you get the chance ?
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	Yes . I was in charge of profit and loss for the northwest region of Canada . As a manager , I was directly responsible for a 50 % increase in sales over a four-month period .
__label__noemo	May I have your name ?
__label__noemo	Yes , sure . You need to put your card in the slot .
__label__noemo	Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ?
__label__noemo	Basketball and swimming .
__label__noemo	I think he will be back around 2:00 . If you like , please leave your name and phone number , I'll have him call you as soon as he comes back .
__label__noemo	Mary , come here . I've found the book our teacher recommended us to buy last week .
__label__noemo	It's too early . Let's make it seven , OK ?
__label__noemo	I think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He's still a millionaire .
__label__noemo	What challenges is your country's economy facing at the moment ?
__label__noemo	What are the charges you ’ re referring to ?
__label__joy	Why not ? The Sweetheart pendant matches the cell phone well . I'd take this one .
__label__noemo	Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ?
__label__noemo	Your LC must be opened at least onemonth before the time shipment , otherwise we won't be able to catch the ship .
__label__anger	I can't stand being with you any more . I'm sick of your drinking .
__label__noemo	Tomorrow afternoon .
__label__noemo	Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road .
__label__noemo	We should choose from the backups .
__label__noemo	Hum , don ’ t say that . Maybe you can do something useful for me .
__label__noemo	What do you think of it ?
__label__noemo	I sure did . How about you ?
__label__noemo	I would like a cup of decaf with cream and no sugar .
__label__noemo	How do you feel ?
__label__noemo	what's wrong ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to have some vegetables first .
__label__noemo	Wine ’ s fine by me . Let ’ s order a bottle of the house red then .
__label__sadness	I lost all my lottery winnings playing the stock market .
__label__noemo	Certainly I have . I like to read books on vary subjects , and i can read everything I can get my hands on in my spare time . I don't want to idle away and waste my time .
__label__joy	Great play !
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__joy	but i can see you dance wonderfully well .
__label__noemo	I need to know if I have any fees to pay .
__label__noemo	Now , tell me , what do you eat ?
__label__noemo	Because they are full-grown . Look at their curvy figures .
__label__noemo	20 percent is the best discount I can offer . That will came to 72yuan .
__label__noemo	Take a look at this dress ! Don't you think it's perfect for you , ma'am ? Uh , where are you going , ma'am ? Ma'am ?
__label__noemo	Quite a few times , I had my back to the wall .
__label__noemo	Well , I was wondering what the salaries are like ? I mean ... are they much lower than the corporate world ?
__label__noemo	No , there aren't . I'm sorry .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__noemo	There you go .
__label__noemo	Well , let me check . We delivered four bags to room 1106 , you friend's room about an hour ago .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__noemo	I see , but games are played in different ways . I'm wondering what type of games do you like to play ?
__label__noemo	I bet he is . He domed his own life .
__label__noemo	Well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places .
__label__joy	Sometimes , it ’ s hard to know who belongs in each section of the museum !
__label__noemo	I'd like to sit in the rear .
__label__noemo	Maybe one month . Just have a try first . Not too tough at the beginning .
__label__noemo	I see
__label__noemo	This room is filthy with cockroaches .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	Is she as clever as you ?
__label__noemo	It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .
__label__noemo	Everything you can see will be on sale .
__label__noemo	Yes , that's what I think.Maybe the next time you go out with him to buy groceries , you'll get lost for even longer.Maybe six hours or so .
__label__noemo	How do I get to the Olympic Stadium , please ?
__label__noemo	Sure . The main courses I took included commercial accounting , cost accounting , industrial accounting , electronic accounting , and so on .
__label__noemo	I think I just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid not . He's in jail for house-breaking at the moment .
__label__noemo	Why ? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live .
__label__noemo	I need you to help me .
__label__noemo	What's the admission charge ?
__label__noemo	That's probably because he grades on a curve .
__label__noemo	I'm exhausted . My new exercise class is so hard ,
__label__noemo	I didn't mean to . It was an accident .
__label__noemo	they need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though .
__label__noemo	Certainly sir , would you like some rice or noodles with that ?
__label__joy	I know of the past years we have faced and shared troubles , but we survived and here we are .
__label__noemo	The price varies according to the seats . 300 for the front , 200 for the middle , and 50 for the back .
__label__noemo	It's a promise .
__label__noemo	That is too expensive .
__label__noemo	Did he leave when you left ?
__label__noemo	We'll need two bedrooms . The kitchen and dining room can be separate or combined .
__label__joy	Thanks for your help .
__label__noemo	I'm Rudy Randolph at 818-555-1234 , April ninth to the fifteenth .
__label__noemo	In fact , in the past we only attended local exhibitions .
__label__joy	That ’ s very kind of you . But if I don ’ t go now I ’ ll miss the last bus .
__label__noemo	Yes , in all these four sports . the Chinese Olympic dream teams led the way . They swept the floor against their opponents in table tennis and diving .
__label__noemo	I need to make sure that my wife will be financially secure if I die .
__label__noemo	What did you do at the office today ?
__label__noemo	Well , it's one way to get through the in-betweens if you really want to grow it out !
__label__noemo	Please come in !
__label__noemo	I actually like having a curfew . I have an excuse to get to bed on time .
__label__noemo	You are welcome . It's our job to keep things running smoothly .
__label__noemo	That's true , and we have been on this bus for a while .
__label__surprise	70 hours ? I would be dead if I worked hard like that .
__label__noemo	Well , there ’ s one more thing . The telephone is dead .
__label__noemo	Go ahead . It will be safe with me .
__label__joy	This is interesting , Ms.Parker .
__label__noemo	What sports do they play there ?
__label__noemo	Well , say hello to him for me .
__label__noemo	Are there tickets for Saturday then ?
__label__noemo	Thank you , but I prefer the fish
__label__noemo	There was a stop sign back there that you didn't stop for .
__label__noemo	The phone bill ’ s in my name .
__label__noemo	I'm in Beijing , at the Weston Hotel .
__label__noemo	Do you know this song ?
__label__noemo	Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ?
__label__noemo	My family setup is a bit different . In New York city , there're only three people , my mother , my stepfather and me . During this summertime , I fly out to California and live with my dad . Dad's getting
__label__noemo	All right , I ’ ll leave her the message , Mary . Thanks for calling .
__label__noemo	"According to the dictates of Eng Shut , it is favorable to site a residence to the south of a nearby hill . When the capital was moved to Beijing , no hill existed at this location , so one was constructed . It is called "" Coal Hill "" . The last emper-or of Ming Dynasty , Chongzhen , committed suicide by hanging himself here in 1644 ."
__label__noemo	Hi , may I speak to Ryan , please ?
__label__noemo	Have you seen a lot of them ?
__label__noemo	My boyfriend is an attorney and told me that I could fax him anything if I had a question .
__label__noemo	What kind of job do you think I should get ?
__label__noemo	This is room eleven-seven and my name is Terry Chen .
__label__noemo	And your point is ?
__label__joy	Sounds not bad ! You know , the only thing I worried about is the safety . I ’ m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
__label__disgust	Oh , yeah ! I had a blast ! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . Sorry , I ’ m just not into this health kick .
__label__noemo	About twenty minutes .
__label__noemo	Books in the first aisle are all best sellers .
__label__anger	You know you didn't .
__label__noemo	Have all the operators been trained on it ?
__label__noemo	Hello , three-five .
__label__joy	I think so too.Let ' s go !
__label__joy	We enjoy it too !
__label__noemo	Yes . If we don't have the facilities to deal with it here , we send it out for maintenance .
__label__noemo	What did you do ?
__label__noemo	Um ?
__label__noemo	Nice to meet you , Ms . Wang . You must be exhausted after your long trip from Canada .
__label__noemo	Okay , sign me up for the class on Monday and Wednesday .
__label__noemo	people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated .
__label__noemo	It is in mine too.The biggest issue is water . The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important .
__label__joy	Jenny plans to hold it in church .
__label__noemo	I see . Yes , you'll need to renew your passport in a few months . Make sure you don't let it expire while you are in the UK .
__label__noemo	And can you get a seat ?
__label__noemo	Thanks a lot . Sorry to trouble you .
__label__noemo	All right .
__label__noemo	John , why don ’ t you go and do some gardening ? The lawn needs weeding .
__label__noemo	Let me see . A roasted duck is 15 dollars . A plate of pork is 10 dollars . A bowl of beef is 6 dollars . Two bottles of beer are 3 dollars.That ' ll be a total of 34 dollars .
__label__noemo	I am calling to ask the position of HR manager . Could you tell me more about it ?
__label__noemo	May I show you the gold ones ?
__label__noemo	Is it all right for me to come in now . Mr . Sutcliffe ?
__label__noemo	Short and sweet ? But what if I have to explain something complicated ?
__label__noemo	And do you like English food ?
__label__noemo	I really can't wait that long . Are there any other buses that can take me there ?
__label__noemo	Yes , please .
__label__fear	Frightened ? You must be joking .
__label__noemo	Believe me . I will get up and get ready in five minutes .
__label__noemo	Just to the bottom of my ears . By the way , I'd like a shave , too .
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__joy	You are welcome .
__label__noemo	Oh , cheer up ! A girlfriend is not everything .
__label__noemo	That's long leave . How's your project coming along ?
__label__noemo	it's not that bad . It kind of feels like I'm on vacation , not having to answer my phone all the time !
__label__noemo	Yes , someone is coming to get me .
__label__noemo	Look at this survey conducted by a website . A quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . Hi , Francis , what about you ?
__label__noemo	David , do you think which team will get the champion tonight ?
__label__noemo	I understand .
__label__noemo	I've tried , but I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program .
__label__joy	Baby , I love you so much .
__label__noemo	We're having trouble with Bob .
__label__noemo	Would you mind telling me then — what were those four years of college for ? What was the point of all that hard work ?
__label__noemo	I want to get some ground beef .
__label__noemo	How about having a cup of tea with us ?
__label__anger	Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .
__label__noemo	I see . Did anything else happen ?
__label__noemo	Are you sure you can be a successful cashier ?
__label__noemo	I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher .
__label__noemo	You don ’ t know that ?
__label__noemo	Will it exfoliate the skin as well ?
__label__noemo	Have you visited our souvenir shop , sir ? It's loaded with all kinds of items .
__label__noemo	Hello , Helen . This is John . How are you ?
__label__noemo	Yes , that would be great . How much is the room ?
__label__surprise	Are you kidding ? I ’ m terrible ! But I love to watch sports . I go to football or baseball games a lot . And I read sports magazines every week .
__label__sadness	I am pretty sure that I am in trouble .
__label__noemo	There are two types of L / C here and I'm not sure which one I want .
__label__joy	I hope you enjoy your dinner .
__label__noemo	I understand . Rain does make it smell cleaner .
__label__noemo	Have you worked in a computer company before ?
__label__joy	Well , then , I'll talk to you later . Have a good day !
__label__noemo	Let's go and buy one .
__label__noemo	I can help you if you can just tell me what evening you like the reservation for .
__label__noemo	It must have really hurt afterwards .
__label__noemo	Deal , Where is Gucci ?
__label__joy	Now that ’ s a great idea !
__label__noemo	They are keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
__label__noemo	I want to have a continental breakfast .
__label__noemo	It sounds quite simple . Next time when I travel abroad , I will apply for this kind of check too .
__label__noemo	Yes , I have , but it doesn ’ t help me very much . I ’ m not very good at reading maps .
__label__noemo	I would've never known .
__label__noemo	What time is the most convenient for you to change rooms , sir ?
__label__noemo	It's rather an unusual case . Have you found the cause of leaking ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry . I won't do it again .
__label__surprise	Wow ! I have been working here for 15 years and you ’ re the first person to accept a lost luggage situation cheerfully .
__label__noemo	Hello !
__label__noemo	Half past six ... and it's half past six already .
__label__noemo	Thanks anyway , but I'll do it , Rebecca . Let's get the class .
__label__noemo	What ?
__label__noemo	Hi , David . You are very difficult to reach . I called several times . But I kept getting a busy signal . Is your phone out of order ?
__label__joy	Take care and give my best to you parents .
__label__noemo	What kind of chocolate do you want ?
__label__noemo	The music is on.May I have the pleasure to dance with you ?
__label__joy	thanks !
__label__joy	Good morning , Kevin .
__label__joy	It is a great pleasure for me to have this opportunity for interview .
__label__noemo	I mean it ’ s not his fault .
__label__anger	This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it .
__label__joy	That's a great relief . I was worried about him .
__label__noemo	I'll keep that in mind . And how much is it altogether ?
__label__noemo	Then we must pay a large amount of money for the hotel . But if we want to save money , we can choose a hotel which is not so good .
__label__noemo	No , I'm stuffed . The check , please .
__label__noemo	Daddy , don't mention it .
__label__noemo	That's not bad . It could be a short-term alternative . Your mum can look for another one when the market improves . Things will work out eventually .
__label__noemo	No . Not that . I mean a training card.The card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine.Here , let me show you .
__label__noemo	Du Kun .
__label__joy	I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really , arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff .
__label__noemo	All right , thanks .
__label__noemo	So you're quite happy with your new job ?
__label__noemo	OK , I'll take one order of that .

__label__noemo	She is dealing with customers and driving up new business . The guy next to her is in charge of their office computer network .
__label__joy	Not at all .
__label__noemo	I like designing products , and one of my designs received an award . Moreover , I am familiar with CAD . But I can do any mechanic well if I am employed .
__label__noemo	It's just a regular inspection . Do you have anything to declare ?

__label__joy	No problem , sir . Let me help you .
__label__noemo	No , I don't .
__label__noemo	I prefer a package tour , and we don't have to worry about accommodation , meals or that sort of trivial demanding things .
__label__noemo	I think it leaves at two thirty .
__label__noemo	Do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
__label__noemo	Give me a six-piece chicken nuggets , a large fry and a large Coke .
__label__noemo	Okay , well it ’ s always more difficult to describe them isn ’ t it ?
__label__joy	No , really ! And she told me the secret to winning , wear red underwear !
__label__noemo	For color prints ?
__label__joy	Wow ! I can ’ t believe I ’ m standing here !

__label__noemo	OK , so here ’ s the plan ; When we land , run to gate 14 !
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__noemo	Nine total . Seven children and my parents .
__label__noemo	I don't know , she didn't say . I'm so sorry about this .

__label__noemo	That will be on the second of December . Be there half an hour early to get your bags on the bus . Do you understand ?
__label__noemo	It's for myself .
__label__noemo	May I ask whether we are allowed to wear casual clothes in the office ?
__label__joy	The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ’ s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful .
__label__noemo	Why not ? It's the very reason why I've applied for this job . It's really exciting for me to experience business in an international environment .
__label__joy	Yes , the fitting room is over there , it looks fantastic on you , this style color in sizes natural here and figure , perfectly .
__label__noemo	I like peace.As a matter of fact , I once had a job in a library .

__label__joy	How beautiful the flower is !
__label__noemo	Where can we get batteries ?
__label__noemo	I just want to make sure that there is possibility of giving us a loan .
__label__surprise	But I should have aced it . I mean I finished the paper so quickly , thinking it's a piece of cake . But when I knew my result , I was like what ? That can't be true !
__label__noemo	I only know him through the ... you are not gonna believe this .
__label__joy	I hope so . A good journey to you !
__label__noemo	Why does he want to do that ?
__label__noemo	Don't worry , most of the leads on mildly interested , if not strongly interested . We've just got to make sure the Hot ones are contacted right away . And even the contacts that for what ever reason aren't prepared to make an order now , they might be interested in the future . Please be conscanciouss about getting a hold of everyone of these leads . We've spent a big chunk of marketing budget to find these people . I don't want our investment to go down the drain .
__label__joy	Great . How long were you away ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , I'm very nauseous.It ' s mostly nausea and a fever .
__label__noemo	Who's in charge of the construction project ?
__label__noemo	May I see some identification , sir , please ?

__label__surprise	Well , oh my God , there is another problem , I'm afraid . There is still a stain on the shirt .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes .
__label__anger	If I hear Love Me Tender one more time , I think I'll go crazy !
__label__noemo	You spoken English is pretty good . Please tell me your experience in learning English .
__label__noemo	Poor old John ! I am ever so sorry .
__label__noemo	I'm very hungry , Donald . What can I eat ?
__label__noemo	I never did like this MP4 anyway . I won't hear of it .
__label__noemo	One orange juice , scrambled eggs with bacon , toast and coffee .
__label__noemo	What's it like in summer ?
__label__joy	Yes , that sounds like a good idea .
__label__joy	Good . Thank you for telling me this .
__label__noemo	They are professors and government officials .
__label__noemo	Oh , it runs every 20 mins . You must have missed it , when you came here . It should be here any minute now .
__label__noemo	We've had a few problems . One of the bolts has worked loose and a blade has snapped off .
__label__noemo	When can you do that ?
__label__noemo	How about a movie tonight ?
__label__noemo	Thank you and take care .
__label__joy	You said it .
__label__noemo	All right . Our insurance coverage is 110 % of the invoice value , up to the port of destination only .
__label__noemo	I don't know . You should know how she's going to react . She is your girlfriend .
__label__noemo	OK , but please make sure that you get all of your make-up work completed .
__label__noemo	I want a shirt .
__label__noemo	I'd like to open a current account .
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . Fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things .
__label__noemo	How about a love story then ?
__label__noemo	Of course . Here you are .
__label__noemo	No , not yet . But Susan says they ’ d like to get married in November or December . Then they ’ ll go to Hawaii for their honeymoon .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t you always fail in the math tests ?
__label__noemo	What about the trip ? Do you enjoy yourself ?
__label__noemo	Certainly . It could really benefit someone like you . Besides insurance for you , you can also get more or less dividends from the insurance company .
__label__noemo	Yes . How much is it to send these things to Shanghai by regular delivery ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I am aware of them .
__label__noemo	Are you applying to study or work abroad ?
__label__noemo	How much does it cost per day ?
__label__noemo	I think that those are some really nice shoes . What kind are they ?
__label__noemo	You didn't ring me last night . You said you would .
__label__noemo	Hello . Where are you headed today ?
__label__noemo	Wow , must be interesting to watch dragon boats compete a-gainst one another on the city river .
__label__noemo	I just got a message from my sister saying that she's been in a car accident . I need to go pick her up .
__label__anger	Very well , consider me gone .
__label__noemo	Does he have any other complaints ?
__label__joy	Oh , good . Why don ’ t you take the bus to mine and we could play Mah Tiang ?

__label__noemo	Yes . I ’ ll do it tomorrow .
__label__noemo	I see.Did they succeed in the end ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I get it .
__label__noemo	What would you like for dessert ?
__label__joy	Great – That ’ ll be big help .
__label__noemo	Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Mcintosh and Apple are the same thing .
__label__joy	I ’ m fantastic !
__label__noemo	To run a successful internet business , it requires a little research and relatively small investment . You've got to have a good idea of some kind of product that is in demand or would be popular .
__label__noemo	No . You see , I went back to school to get my Master ’ s Degree when I was in my thirties . You won ’ t be older than that .
__label__noemo	I want to try the local specialty . Can you recommend me some ?
__label__noemo	How do I use it ?
__label__noemo	Is it a color TV or a black and white TV ?
__label__noemo	perhaps I ’ m being too shy . I should go out more too and not spend time worrying about tests !
__label__noemo	All right . But what was the trouble ?
__label__noemo	well , to be honest , there's another reason . I've got a better offer .
__label__noemo	Help me hang up this picture , please . Would you hold it straight while I put in the nail ?
__label__surprise	So ?
__label__noemo	She's not a house-cat . She stays outside most of the time .
__label__joy	Yes , I will . Thanks for your care .
__label__noemo	Well , I want a fillet steak , medium , but my little girl doesn't care for steak . Could she have something else instead ?
__label__noemo	Well , my family's away and I can't afford to do much.What about you ?
__label__joy	It's my pleasure .
__label__joy	And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government .
__label__noemo	Okay.Hey , is that a dark cloud over there ? Do you think it will rain after all ?
__label__sadness	You know that my father is irritable .
__label__noemo	They could go out and play with their friends .
__label__noemo	O . K . Great . Just sign and date it here ?
__label__joy	He performs very well . He is so funny !
__label__noemo	It ’ s still too much . Can ’ t you make it any cheaper than that ?
__label__noemo	Yeas , It is . Sewen Jes speaking . How can I help ?
__label__noemo	What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	She likes to golf , dance and eat foreign food .
__label__noemo	That dress is too expensive .
__label__noemo	No , and I don ’ t usually get a lot of stomachaches .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , can you tell me where I can take a taxi ? This is the first time I have been in England , so I don't know where I can do at all .
__label__noemo	We are willing to participate in the bid which you advertised in China Daily . Would you please tell me the detail of the tender conditions ?
__label__noemo	Sure , I have a friend who play fairly well . We should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game .
__label__noemo	We cannot pay you unless you turn that form in every two weeks .
__label__anger	You mean I won't get a raise until recession ends ?
__label__noemo	There are two classes that are still open .
__label__noemo	Sorry , I don ’ t know the rule about punching .
__label__noemo	Make sure you come here before noon . I will be picking up my friend at the airport in the afternoon .
__label__noemo	Thanks . What time will you arrive ?
__label__joy	Oh , don ’ t worry , I will !
__label__noemo	I like watching comedies , like ' Boat ' . Do you like watching comedies too ?
__label__joy	Thank you for your compliment .
__label__noemo	Your tie is handsome .
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . I'll show you some .
__label__noemo	Icecream , please .
__label__noemo	And no hijackers .
__label__noemo	Look , the printer isn ’ t functioning well . I ’ Ve pushed the start button . It is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log . What ’ s going on ?
__label__joy	My pleasure .
__label__noemo	In this period , you can only get the basic salary , 2,500 yuan per month .
__label__noemo	What do you find frustrating in a work situation ?
__label__noemo	So does it mean we're arriving on the same day ?
__label__joy	yes . He always get us special gift . We should repay his kindness .
__label__joy	Bye !
__label__noemo	How many of them were there ?
__label__noemo	3 Yuan , please .
__label__joy	I'm really glad that you came to see me .
__label__noemo	You ’ re going to set up your own law office , aren ’ t you ?
__label__joy	Sure , here you go .
__label__noemo	We'll just give you a credit for the inconvenience .
__label__anger	Why are you arresting me ?
__label__noemo	It looks more like a toy , or a cool briefcase !
__label__noemo	Sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ?
__label__joy	That sounds an interesting job , Bob .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__noemo	Peter , where are you going ?
__label__noemo	Certainly . A letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted . A memorandum is a communication within an organization .
__label__noemo	What did the critic say ?
__label__noemo	well , he'll definitely lose his license , pay a fine , and maybe even spend some time in jail .
__label__joy	I love the balcony . We can sit outside and enjoy the sun in summer . We are on the 12th floor , so there ’ s very nice view from the balcony .
__label__noemo	Could you quote the price of CIF Hamburg ?
__label__noemo	Why are you so rude to your wife ?
__label__noemo	No problem . Do you want the money to go by M / T or T / T ?
__label__noemo	hello ?
__label__noemo	That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ?
__label__noemo	Single or return ?
__label__joy	It's weekend again , I'm glad I can arrange for my personal matters .
__label__noemo	Did you tell him ?
__label__noemo	I went out on one interview , but I haven ’ t heard back from them .
__label__noemo	Yes . Copywriters are supposed to design and write articles for the advertising company .
__label__anger	We have to wait six more minutes !
__label__noemo	Anything else ?
__label__joy	It's beautiful here .
__label__joy	You are welcome .
__label__noemo	I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Yes , it's right over here .
__label__noemo	About half an hour , if there's no traffic jam .
__label__noemo	That ’ s human nature .
__label__surprise	Are you sure ? Who told you that ? I highly doubt that they would take the step to merge into one company ... They're supposed to be bitter enemies , the strictest of competitors.It must be a rumor.It can't be true .
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__anger	He doesn ’ t lift a finger ! I bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon .
__label__noemo	Great ! Would you prefer smoking or nonsmoking ?
__label__noemo	Is there anything valuable in it ?
__label__noemo	I don ’ t think I can get up enough nerve to do this .
__label__noemo	Yes , stones .
__label__noemo	I'm still not too jazzed about going ... I feel kind of awkward in those cocktail party situations .
__label__joy	thanks . I appreciate that .
__label__noemo	Yes , it's so cold .
__label__noemo	Ok .
__label__noemo	Yeah ... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there .
__label__noemo	Not at all . When you wash it , it will fall into place naturally . You'll probably need another cut in about a month . Shall I make an appointment for you ?
__label__noemo	I know ! Anyways I just talked to Alex ’ s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party It ’ s gonna be so much fun ! All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night .
__label__surprise	Really ? I've already opened this one.Say , this is sweet , and it's just what I need to go with my new suit.Thank you ever so much .
__label__joy	It looks good . Pack me a bouquet of violet , please .
__label__joy	ok ! I ’ ll bring one to you next time .
__label__noemo	In order to prevent the fish from eating the poet's body .
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve changed my mind .
__label__noemo	Hello , Pam .
__label__noemo	Dad , you've been driving for three hours . Why don't we have a switch ?
__label__noemo	What happened ?
__label__noemo	Wait a minute . I made a phone call , but I never made a connection .
__label__noemo	Let's take a break .
__label__joy	I will , thanks for your concern .
__label__noemo	I'm good . How are you ?
__label__noemo	Yes , that's the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ?
__label__joy	Oh , good . How old is your niece ?
__label__noemo	I can schedule you for that day and time .
__label__noemo	Have you gone out on any interviews so far ?
__label__noemo	Sometimes I think television is too biased . None of them are completely objective .
__label__noemo	Yes , they are .
__label__noemo	No problem .
__label__noemo	Very well . Let's see , according to his vaccination record , Ricky has received his Polio , Tetanus and Hepatitis B shots . He is 14 months old , so he is due for Hepatitis A , Chickenpox and Measles shots .
__label__noemo	I like Indian food as well .
__label__noemo	Got it . Are you still updating your blog ?

__label__noemo	I don't know . I never went to one .
__label__noemo	That is so lucky of you .
__label__noemo	What experience do you have with office machinery ?
__label__noemo	Daniel , carrots contain much Vitamin C . It is good for you .
__label__noemo	Can I have your keys , please ? Thank you . Here's your statement .
__label__noemo	Excuse me.Could you please tell me where the train station is ?
__label__noemo	No , I don't think she's that strong-minded .
__label__joy	Wow , you ’ Ve inspired me to do something !
__label__joy	The same to me . All the things here make me happy , the mountain , the water , the grass , the birds , the sunshine ...
__label__noemo	I have been washing the dishes for over a week now .
__label__noemo	Yes , the climate of France rarely has severe winters . In southern France , one can live in comfort the whole year . Is Japan good for farming ?
__label__joy	Of course , otherwise you ’ ll just have to wait for hours .
__label__noemo	Yes , Mr.Forester .
__label__noemo	Should I be contacting my bank in the meantime ?
__label__noemo	I want some cosmetics.Could you recommend some ?
__label__joy	No problem !
__label__joy	Yes , They are great fun and very challenging , too . Some day I'll want to try deep-sea diving and rock-climbing , too .

__label__noemo	I'd like to reserve a double room . I will be arriving next Monday , the 12th . My name is Wilson .

__label__sadness	I'm very sorry for that , but I sent you several messages to explain , my mom was seriously ill , and I had to look afer her .
__label__noemo	Oh , really ? I just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert , painting , handwriting , reading novels and reading fashion magazines . What about yours ?
__label__noemo	What ?
__label__noemo	OK ! I expect you to accept our general terms and conditions of trade . We believe that through our cooperation , large transactions will be brought to speedy conclusion .
__label__noemo	Well , we apply tape and plaster to from a solid enclosure to protect the bones from moving . In this way they will heal properly . Take it easy . It won't hurt you . Let me see . The X-ray picture indicates that your humerus is broken in two places . And you'll have to wear the cast for three weeks . You'll need to come back in two weeks , so I can have another look .
__label__noemo	So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?
__label__noemo	Have you tried university part-time jobs ?
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	Are you a medical or surgical case ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I want to book a room .
__label__joy	Thank you very much !
__label__joy	Great minds think alike .
__label__noemo	I've been looking for a swimming pool , but I haven't found one yet .
__label__noemo	When is your garden at its best ?
__label__noemo	To be honest , I haven't really done much research .
__label__joy	I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent .
__label__noemo	I read in the newspapers that the passenger liners from Shanghai to Ningpo and Dalian have been out of business ; and the liners up and down the Yangtze River have been reduced by 70 % .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I quit .
__label__noemo	not really . I went to the veterinarian to get her vaccinated and she told me that all I needed to do was to make sure to trim its nails from time to time , to give her food and water , and to clean its

__label__noemo	Carton ?
__label__noemo	Are there any cities where it rains a lot ?
__label__noemo	Can I have my check , please .
__label__noemo	The tape player doesn ’ t work .
__label__noemo	Well , maybe . But I like the little kid who played Manakin Skywalker . I can't imagine anyone else playing that role .
__label__noemo	I can show you where they are .
__label__surprise	What ?
__label__noemo	There was a truck on the freeway , and it flipped over .
__label__noemo	Then what time do you think he will be in ?
__label__noemo	Basically , I ’ Ve got a few concerns about him , and the bottom line is , I don ’ t think he ’ s a good fit for our company .
__label__anger	Oh ... I'm sweating already . It's so hot . I can feel it boiling ! Can I get out yet ?
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__noemo	Is that satisfactory ?
__label__noemo	Good.Can you give me some information about it ... uh .. mileage and the tires and things like that ?

__label__joy	No , thanks . You ’ Ve done a lot for me already . Thank you for everything .
__label__noemo	No , Your Honor , I was not .

__label__noemo	we landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again .
__label__noemo	Then , when do you plan to get married ?
__label__noemo	You ’ re not allowed to do that .
__label__noemo	Put it this way – it wasn ’ t cheap .
__label__noemo	I don't want you to misunderstand , Miss Briggs.We are very serious about hiring you . We want you to teach for us.We usually do contracts this way because it is more convenient .
__label__joy	It's great ! Where did you get the CD ?
__label__noemo	Oh , no , you don't .
__label__noemo	it was a good game , but not good enough to watch again . Keep surfing .
__label__noemo	Economy fare for single ticket from Beijing to Shanghai is 500 yuan .
__label__noemo	Yes , I am , but I think it ’ s time for some plastic surgery I ’ m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . See ?
__label__joy	I've been great . What about you ?
__label__noemo	No , I don't .
__label__noemo	I'm going to stay in the city .
__label__joy	Oh , that's great .
__label__noemo	Ok . Where shall I pay duty for it ?
__label__noemo	Well , sir , I was just hoping that I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year .
__label__noemo	She is dealing with customers and driving up new business . The guy next to her is in charge of their office computer network .
__label__noemo	I suggest that you go to the lawyers ' office to get some help .
__label__joy	Maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer .
__label__noemo	Do you receive any other income ?
__label__noemo	We always sell the best . You can believe us at this point .
__label__noemo	Fair enough !
__label__noemo	B , your main duty is to answer phone calls and transfer files to the person who wants them . Is that difficult ?
__label__noemo	( while driving ) Are you in a hurry ?
__label__noemo	Well , it was definitely worth all the time .
__label__noemo	My favorite recreation is cooking . I learned to cook Chinese dishes and western style dishes as well . It keeps me busy and makes me happy .
__label__noemo	Well , let me get that out of your way . Would you like to order something else from the menu ? Or I could bring you another order of chicken if you'd like .

__label__noemo	Teamwork is ok to me , and I hope the team will be complementary in personality .
__label__joy	Yes , absolutely ! We have a very good reputation in the neighborhood .
__label__noemo	Right . I ’ ll see you later .

__label__noemo	I will be sending someone out as soon as I can get hold of the roofer . Will you be home this morning ?
__label__noemo	It's a lovely day out today , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college .
__label__noemo	I'm going to have to say that Superbad is the best movie ever .
__label__noemo	Yeah , the new ones can be tricky . What are you trying to buy ?
__label__joy	Thanks . I ’ m proud of myself , too .
__label__noemo	The journey is worth while . Where are we going after this ?
__label__noemo	Do you want an international money order or a banker's draft ?
__label__noemo	Hey . Steven . You have a large chunk of money , but why do you still live in the old flat , instead of buying a new villa ?
__label__noemo	This one looks really expensive though .
__label__noemo	So , I passed ?
__label__noemo	Don't worry about that . I'll reimburse you as soon as I receive the package .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem . In fact , he's booked up the whole week except tomorrow afternoon .

__label__noemo	no . I'm new here . I just moved here a few months ago .
__label__noemo	Yes . I'm looking for some perfume . Do you have perfumes with a light scent ?
__label__noemo	But I'm not sleepy , darling . I want to finish it today .

__label__noemo	Which team do you think will emerge with the last laugh in this World Cup ?
__label__noemo	OK , I'll process that for you now .
__label__noemo	May I have your name and contact number , Sir ?
__label__noemo	What ’ s the matter ?
__label__noemo	A lot of people do . I'll try it for a while anyway , but I certainly don't want to pay a lot of parking tickets .
__label__noemo	In that case , how about this one ? It ’ s inexpensive but it ’ s still well made and easy to play .
__label__noemo	I agree with you .
__label__joy	I love ice cream .
__label__noemo	Unusual pet are often more expensive to keep . Is that a problem ?
__label__anger	No , but now he'll be in trouble . What's a boyfriend for ? To forget about Valentine's Day ?

__label__noemo	In Chicago .
__label__noemo	Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .
__label__noemo	You sure have bad luck these days .
__label__noemo	I've paid for it . Here's the receipt .

__label__noemo	OK , let's go .
__label__noemo	Of course , I'll try my best.When can I start working ?

__label__noemo	And I don't like meat that much.The only meat I eat is chicken .
__label__noemo	I'm not sure yet.Maybe this will all be gone in a day . So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments . I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think .
__label__noemo	Yes , please . And you can cash my traveler's check , can't you ?
__label__noemo	Good morning , sir . Can I help you ?

__label__noemo	you're rather energetic today . What's going on ?
__label__noemo	No .
__label__noemo	Yes , but I'll bet she won't again .
__label__joy	Bye ! See you on Saturday evening .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll come down and watch you play some day , and see what it ’ s like .
__label__noemo	If you were assigned some work which you are not so interested , would you take it or not ?
__label__noemo	No . And on the contrary , I feel young , fresh and energetic .
__label__noemo	Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ?
__label__noemo	Get this prescription filled and go straight to bed .
__label__surprise	Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant .
__label__joy	Not at all .
__label__noemo	OK . I've got it .
__label__noemo	That bad , huh ?
__label__noemo	I heard you are looking for a house .
__label__noemo	That's fine .
__label__noemo	What should he have then ?
__label__noemo	Artistic tapestry is the highest expression form of the rug weaving art . How about these ones ?
__label__noemo	Fifty dollars . What is the exchange rate today ?
__label__noemo	Hi . I need to have my shoes repaired .
__label__joy	Come on . Put the gun down .
__label__joy	That's all right . I'm almost finished . Do you need my help ?
__label__noemo	I don't understand very well . Could you give me a map ?
__label__noemo	Your clock never works . Perhaps you should buy a new one .
__label__noemo	Coach .
__label__noemo	But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity.And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example.they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .
__label__noemo	The river in my city sometime freeze over . People go ice-skating on it . In summer people go boating on the river . But few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
__label__noemo	Thank you for calling . I really appreciate your kindness . But right now , I ’ m very busy preparing for an interview of another company . I don ’ t think I am available for this opportunity .
__label__noemo	Isn ’ t this great ? I always wanted to own a farm , live out in the country , grow my own food !
__label__noemo	I'm told Cold Blood just finished its last cut .
__label__disgust	Coffee ? I don ’ t honestly like that kind of stuff .
__label__surprise	Really ? Me too .
__label__noemo	Is it serious , Doctor ?
__label__noemo	Nothing really , you ?
__label__noemo	O . K . Ticket , please .
__label__noemo	What , curly ?
__label__noemo	Yes , the service certainly didn't add to the experience .
__label__noemo	Mr Green , please .
__label__joy	Hello , Rebecca , fancy meeting you here !
__label__noemo	Oh ok , where do I get off ?
__label__noemo	would you like something to drink ? I've got tea and some grape juice .
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__noemo	What's his job ?
__label__joy	Thanks anyway , but I'll do it , Rebecca . Let's get to class .
__label__noemo	It ’ s too bad that you have to leave so early .
__label__noemo	What exercises can I do to firm up my backside
__label__noemo	I need a hat . Would you show me some ?
__label__noemo	What did you do last night ?
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	Yes and no . Let me see if I can clarify that . The terms are the same except that the contract for training has a clause that allows for the cancellation after the first six months .
__label__surprise	That ’ s amazing ! Were any other records broken ?
__label__noemo	Is there a big selection of organic foods at Whole Foods ?
__label__noemo	Well , have you ever heard of Oulong tea and compressed tea ?
__label__noemo	I hear your sister has had an accident , is it true ?
__label__noemo	Helen , why do you keep flushing the toilet ? What's wrong ?
__label__disgust	I don't think the lecture is very interesting .
__label__noemo	I'm Akimbo . Nice to meet you , I guess .
__label__noemo	Lucy , I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ?
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Only if you pay your fine .
__label__joy	I hope so .
__label__noemo	Would you please follow me , please ?
__label__joy	I'm standing in front of an exquisite work of art !
__label__noemo	In the end it was a nice evening and I got an iPad as my birthday present which I wanted for a while .
__label__noemo	Hello . What can I do for you today ?
__label__noemo	And what ’ s the problem ?
__label__joy	Merry Christmas !
__label__noemo	There is a charge on here that I never made .
__label__noemo	Hello , have you made a reservation ?
__label__joy	Hi , Zhengjun , what make you so happy .
__label__noemo	Yes ! Here is my bankbook .
__label__noemo	are you looking for a course ?
__label__noemo	I'm wearing my heavy jacket .
__label__noemo	How do you do ?
__label__noemo	What's it about ? You know , I couldn't help falling asleep .
__label__noemo	I ’ d like to talk to you for a second , please .
__label__joy	There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different.Would you like to go to a concert ?
__label__noemo	I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready .
__label__noemo	I really should be on my way .
__label__noemo	I ’ m all right , thanks . Just a little tired .
__label__noemo	That would be fine .
__label__noemo	What do you plan on doing after you retire ?
__label__noemo	So what does this plan include ?
__label__noemo	Project Management . I was very interested in this course when I was a student . And I think it's very useful for my present work .
__label__noemo	Where did you buy it ?
__label__joy	Of course not . People all over the world watch it on TV , or listen to it on the radio .
__label__noemo	I know that . I mean I couldn't understand her at all .
__label__noemo	And among apples , oranges and bananas , which is your favorite ?
__label__noemo	You still need to eat breakfast , take a shower , and get dressed .
__label__noemo	Sorry , madam . We don't have vacancies at the moment .
__label__noemo	How much antifreeze did you put in your new car then ? You must have to keep it well below zero .
__label__noemo	At 345 Lincoln Avenue . Oklahoma City .
__label__noemo	Oh , I see.how old is she ?
__label__surprise	Oh ? What's that ?
__label__noemo	Ok .
__label__noemo	Here you go .
__label__surprise	Really ? I ’ m surprised .
__label__sadness	But she did and made me disappointed .
__label__noemo	Well , good luck with your garden , especially considering we are in the dry season and it won ’ t rain for the next three months !
__label__noemo	No . I would rather just return it .
__label__noemo	So , can I trust him or what ?
__label__noemo	Can you tell something about the preparation for the register ?
__label__noemo	Do you have any plan to buy a house in this city ?
__label__noemo	Try this on please .
__label__noemo	It ’ s about Bob Dylan .
__label__noemo	Would you please fill in this registration form ?
__label__noemo	Hi , dear , do you know what the important day is today ?
__label__noemo	Good morning , Miss Cai . Congratulations ! You ’ Ve passed the interview .
__label__noemo	If you like , but now we have to think about meals and many other things .
__label__noemo	Okay . This trail looks the best . It's a little steep . But I'm sure it will be alright .
__label__noemo	No ...
__label__noemo	Have you heard when it's supposed to get better ?
__label__joy	Um ... Uh ... I'm just looking , thanks .
__label__noemo	Yes , we just got it and it is fabulous . Well , first you have to turn this switch on .
__label__noemo	Certainly . That shouldn't be a problem . Tell me , do you have a Basic Account with us ?
__label__noemo	I think so . Have you got all that ?
__label__sadness	I don't know what I can do now . I'm down and out .
__label__noemo	Would an order of only 100 units , it'll be difficult to work within that kind of budget . Maybe if you were ordering 500 units or more units , we might be able to work something out .
__label__noemo	Can I help you get ready ?
__label__noemo	Mr Harold Smith .
__label__noemo	I ’ m just not looking forward to cleaning it !
__label__surprise	That ’ s more than my round-trip ticket !
__label__noemo	Aunt Jane buys a new bike for Tom . He is putting on grand airs .
__label__noemo	No , I don't suppose he's to blame.The man in the other car made a mistake .
__label__noemo	It begins at 6:40 every morning , and it goes for 20 minutes .
__label__noemo	I think they are quite reasonable , and the vegetables are very fresh .
__label__joy	Why not ? That's a good idea to help them .
__label__noemo	Yes , you can have multi-accounts on the card , you can also make transfers from the account and securities companies and various other benefits .
__label__joy	I'm pretty good . Thanks for asking .
__label__noemo	How , exactly , does this work ?
__label__noemo	When ?
__label__noemo	I did notice a few stains in the carpet .
__label__noemo	What kind of information would you like ?
__label__noemo	Oh , yeah . Oulong tea is good for one's health . isn't it ?
__label__noemo	What do you do in your spare time ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I will . Do you need it finished right away ?
__label__noemo	Look at this bridge . We will soon be crossing the Thames .
__label__noemo	I was looking at this Kenmore refrigerator .
__label__noemo	I don't know , but I feel terrible .
__label__surprise	The compact ? Why do you think that one is better than the others ?
__label__joy	They sure can . Maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes .
__label__noemo	Nandu . Nandu , how do you spell you name ?
__label__noemo	Yes , but I don't want my Mom to tap my phone when I call Clive .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes . Quite a bit . But we are especially interested in your products .
__label__noemo	Do you have stocks or a title deed of a house to pledge as security ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to have this shirt washed and ironed .
__label__noemo	Got it . Anything else ?
__label__noemo	Conrad Reeves , the actor ? It can ’ t be . Let me have another look . I think you ’ re right ! Isn ’ t he her third husband ?
__label__noemo	No , ma ’ am . This is Sean . Steven ’ s out sick .
__label__noemo	Mr . Sandals , may I see your ID , please ?
__label__noemo	Really , where did you get it ?
__label__joy	Congratulations ! You do have the right attitude .
__label__noemo	That's good . Do you suppose you will be back at company the day after tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	I can tell it from your build .
__label__noemo	Do you have a copy of our service contract with Telecoms ? I'm not happy with their response time and I'd like to check the terms and conditions of the contract .
__label__noemo	We sent you an e-mail the first week we moved in ; it listed the problems we found .
__label__noemo	Talk to him , try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn ’ t work , I say get rid of him and get a new one !
__label__noemo	So what's your illness ... shopping fever , sale-itis ?
__label__joy	When the lower branches are removed , you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree .
__label__joy	I ’ m glad to hear that .
__label__noemo	Oh ... around twenty bucks . A bargain if you ask me . Look at the picture of her playing with it !
__label__noemo	It's time to go . Are you ready ?
__label__noemo	Debit please . Also , could I get cash back ? Fifty dollars would be great .
__label__noemo	That ’ s a hefty amount . But that should have no problem at all . You should be aware that there is a ten-percent service charge , though .
__label__noemo	But I'll miss the news . It's important in my business to keep up with events in China .
__label__noemo	Sure . I ’ d like to see how it washes .
__label__anger	Stop picking on me . I am going to be mad .
__label__noemo	Well , OK . you are always right .
__label__noemo	Dad , I want to draw with crayons , can I ?
__label__noemo	Is there anything I can do for you ?
__label__noemo	Hi , Helen . Where are you going on this summer vacation ?
__label__joy	Okay . I'm in . Let's do it .
__label__noemo	I'd like both .
__label__noemo	And that is ?
__label__noemo	Do you really want it that short ?
__label__noemo	Thank you . Good-bye .
__label__noemo	OK . How much does it cost ?
__label__noemo	Number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they ?
__label__noemo	Yes . If you want to order room service , just press 0 on your phone , and that will connect you with the front desk .
__label__noemo	I see . But I'm not a good swimmer . Can you tell me how deep the pool is ?
__label__noemo	What's it like to work with her ?
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__joy	That would be my pleasure . I'll wrap the perfume up in the gift box for you too .
__label__noemo	Yes , of course . I will book the tour .
__label__noemo	I've heard that people in your country like mutton chops .
__label__noemo	Did you happen to bring that book that we were talking about yesterday ?
__label__joy	I am interested in science fiction .
__label__noemo	Since I first met my wife , about three years .
__label__surprise	Why tell me ? She has nothing to do with me !
__label__noemo	What do you find annoying ?
__label__noemo	Ah , yes , Ms Reeve . I have all of your information here . Do you have the cash cheque ?
__label__noemo	Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can I help you with , Sir ?
__label__noemo	How do you like it here compared to PCC ?
__label__noemo	Well , you've come to the right place . What kind of watch are you looking for ?
__label__noemo	What's the price ? I hope you'll quote us favorably .
__label__noemo	Why didn't you sign the contract ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry , I didn't quite catch that .
__label__noemo	What did you need ?
__label__noemo	Yes , but he should bush it off as if it were not a big deal to him .
__label__noemo	Oh , right . I suppose so . As long as you promise to lose !
__label__noemo	Do you have any plans for dinner tonight ?
__label__noemo	Don ’ t you think it ’ s a bit cold for that ?
__label__surprise	That can ’ t be true !
__label__joy	That ’ s great ! I ’ Ve heard people say that before .
__label__noemo	So who takes care of him then ?
__label__noemo	Every thing for winter is 20 % off .
__label__noemo	You seem to have all the jitters about Jane .
__label__noemo	Of course we do . It is the landlord ’ s responsibility .
__label__surprise	Why not ? Do you think I should like modern dance ?
__label__noemo	Good afternoon , Mr . Green .
__label__noemo	Yes , speaking . Anything I can do for you ?
__label__noemo	You are right . We shouldn't do anything under the table .
__label__noemo	Yes , for the last 20 years .
__label__noemo	She has a yellow dress on and red sneakers .
__label__noemo	What is that ?
__label__noemo	At six o'clock in the International Hotel . We'll pick you up this afternoon . Besides , if you care for visiting , we'll arrange some sightseeing for you .
__label__sadness	I have lots of work to do . What ’ s more , my grandma is ill .
__label__noemo	No , thank you . I think I can handle it .
__label__noemo	My watch says half past five .
__label__joy	OK . Good night , Mr . Smith , Have a good sleep .
__label__noemo	This nutrition cream is for anti-wrinkling and whitening which is a newcomer brand .
__label__noemo	It seems they've been out of luck since the beginning of the event . Their shots hit the woodwork as many as six times . Oh . my goodness ! I'm afraid the team is under a spell .
__label__anger	Exactly.That ' s the worst part .
__label__noemo	There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .
__label__noemo	It ’ s Saturday , a great weekend .
__label__noemo	I see . Well , I can help with the chores while I ’ m here . You two could probably use my help .
__label__noemo	He wants to know if you have bacteria in your urine , which could signal an infection .
__label__noemo	OK . By the way , I'd like to tell you that the check-out time is 12
__label__sadness	Poor Femi . Taylor's death must have made her realize that she still cared for him .
__label__noemo	Vacation time is important to me . I would be willing to give up these other items in order to receive more vacation days .
__label__surprise	How come ?
__label__noemo	There's a major problem with room 507 .
__label__noemo	That's fine . We've allowed forty-eight hours to be on the safe side .
__label__noemo	No , I haven ’ t had any professional experience , but I have always been interested in creative writing .
__label__noemo	Yes , if the card is well kept and has no dirt and scratches .
__label__noemo	Can I borrow some money from you ?
__label__noemo	don ’ t say that yet . A new project could suddenly appear .
__label__surprise	Have you bought another handset
__label__noemo	Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
__label__joy	It's good , and it's easy to make .
__label__noemo	I guess it is . Most countries have on , but we don ’ t .
__label__noemo	Uh , yeah . And I've seen guys in pads tackled . We have no pads . I don't want to be tackled .
__label__noemo	I've got a sore throat and my chest hurts .
__label__joy	Where do you want to meet ?
__label__noemo	I get lost in this library .
__label__noemo	Great ! Our last name is Foster .
__label__noemo	Yes , Sir .
__label__noemo	You can have some fruits for dessert.If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake .
__label__noemo	Good morning , May . Good girl , you are reading English books again .
__label__noemo	Really ? Is it tiring ?
__label__noemo	Are there any beds vacant ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me . We ’ ll need someone to hire staff .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry to hear that .
__label__noemo	What are you worrying about ?
__label__noemo	What are you going to buy ?
__label__noemo	Hey , Dora ! What kind of books do you like to read ?
__label__noemo	Would you please mail these letters , Lucy ?
__label__noemo	Today , I'm told I failed three courses .
__label__noemo	Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .
__label__noemo	I got the flu . I have a fever and a headache . Can I cancel my appointment ?
__label__noemo	Thank god you showed up when you did ! He ’ s insane ! Do you think we should call the police ?
__label__noemo	Oh yeah ! Would you please welcome ... Miss Jan Brown .
__label__noemo	Elvin Dixon . Who are you ?
__label__noemo	If only he knew it .
__label__noemo	Are you doing anything tomorrow morning ? I'm wondering if you'd like to come to my office to discuss the new project .
__label__noemo	Tea and silk .
__label__noemo	I'm very sorry to hear that . May I have your name and room number , please ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry , but Mr . Johnson is out at the moment . Can I take a message ?
__label__joy	Yes we did .
__label__noemo	Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day .
__label__noemo	How does she cook the shrimp ?
__label__noemo	You can ’ t mail it in early because you don ’ t know , in advance , how much you will be working .
__label__noemo	Four times might be enough . Not once or twice .
__label__noemo	I'm not surprised . She's a plain Jane .
__label__noemo	Oh , no . You should take the No . 14 tram .
__label__noemo	I think so . I see it by the radio this morning .
__label__noemo	My older sister Judy will be here soon to help . She already has a boy and a girl of her own ...
__label__noemo	Small world , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	Well , as per capital income goes up and up , the growth sector seems to be in the high-end .
__label__noemo	Hi . Have you got a personal computer ?
__label__noemo	What's the matter ?
__label__joy	Thank you for thinking of that .
__label__noemo	I'd better try harder to memorise my PIN in future . Thanks .
__label__noemo	I can put you down for ten o'clock . Is that alright ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other .
__label__noemo	Good afternoon . I suppose you are Ms . Monica . My name is Mr . Thomas , the general manager of ABC Company . Here is my business card .
__label__noemo	We should be able to finish everything up before then . Let's run through the major points first , and see where we're at . The first matter of business is to approve the minutes of our last meeting .
__label__noemo	I understand , and it will get done after I wake up in five minutes .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__anger	You ’ Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ?
__label__noemo	You should go to the dentist .
__label__joy	Brian ! How have you been ?
__label__noemo	What do you mean by that ?
__label__noemo	Holy cow ! I never heard of such a thing . How much do they cost ?
__label__noemo	Interesting . It must be great having a twin sister . Are you best friends , too ?
__label__noemo	You're not going to cook ?
__label__noemo	Quite sure .
__label__noemo	I need to make a deposit .
__label__noemo	Why is that ?
__label__noemo	Now we arrive at the Cambridge University , it is one of the oldest universities in the world .
__label__noemo	How about this one ? It's not that concentrated .
__label__noemo	Good . We also have health insurance , bonus and paid vacation . When can you begin to work ?
__label__joy	My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink .
__label__noemo	What would you like for dessert ?
__label__noemo	I have children so a steady job is important but I would like a chance to advance .
__label__noemo	Hello , is Marie Ward there , please ?
__label__noemo	You are an expert on it . That wood carving is very rare . But I'm so sorry . that is not for sell .
__label__noemo	Well , let me have a look . Will you sit down in this chair and open your mouth wide ?
__label__joy	Lucky for you , this month we aren ’ t charging our normal installation fee . You are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! And we ’ ll throw in this pen drive !
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__noemo	No , not yet . Can you find a good price there ?
__label__noemo	Great ! But is it free ?
__label__noemo	So am I.The doctor says she'll get over in a month .
__label__joy	I love you , too , Dad .
__label__noemo	Two adult passes , please .
__label__joy	You have no idea ! There's a banquet with prizes , performances ... you name it !
__label__noemo	Are you aware of the aspects of this position and do you feel you are qualified ?
__label__noemo	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	OK . Right then .
__label__noemo	"Ok , so how about this , "" This is Abby and I am really happy you called ! I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can , so please leave me your name and number . Talk to you soon ! "" ."
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? Where ’ d you find it ?
__label__noemo	Hello . Gail Willows speaking .
__label__noemo	I finally went out to dinner with him last night .
__label__noemo	My boots ? Er ... Sure , ok .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	What are they ?
__label__noemo	The stop is really at the mall ?
__label__noemo	What is good for you ?
__label__joy	I'm not sure , perhaps around 8 pm .
__label__noemo	no dissert , thanks , just coffee.can I have the check please ?
__label__noemo	If there's something wrong with it in a week , can I come back to change it ?
__label__noemo	Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo .
__label__noemo	Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up .
__label__noemo	Why not ?
__label__noemo	I go to Panda Express for my Chinese food .
__label__noemo	Well , a lot of the games were pretty silly . I don't know how much it helped us to be a better team , but i think everyone had a good time .
__label__noemo	Come on , Jenny , we are heading our way to the Opera House .
__label__noemo	Hi Jane , you look great .
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . I'd like to have hot food .
__label__anger	Oh , my dear sister , I am no longer a baby !
__label__noemo	Ok .
__label__joy	You are in luck . The traffic is not heavy today .
__label__noemo	Yeah . But his relation with Sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife .
__label__noemo	once in a while , I suppose , I usually rent movies at Movie Salon .
__label__noemo	Dad , I ’ d like to borrow some money .
__label__noemo	They are reports of our company .
__label__noemo	It's E-A-K-I-N-S .
__label__noemo	Well , there is that , yes .
__label__joy	My feeling's exactly .
__label__noemo	The annual charge rate is 9.5 % .
__label__noemo	No . Later we decided to opt for the prior outline , version 7 .
__label__noemo	Can I help you with anything else ?
__label__noemo	I need a passport .
__label__noemo	Cash . Oh , I almost forgot . I need a lid , too .
__label__noemo	No Let's go to an ice cream parlor ! They have way more flavors to choose from there . I feel like having something special like Neapolitan ice cream .
__label__noemo	My daughter isn't feeling well .
__label__noemo	Can you tell me more ?
__label__noemo	The service this evening has kind of sucked . Is that our server over there ?
__label__noemo	No , the other one in the brown case .
__label__noemo	Come here and I will measure you .
__label__noemo	In China , it is impolite to look into the senior speakers eyes while speaking . But in Western countries it is the opposite . Eye contact gives a strong feeling of sincerity . Looking downwards or sideways shows that you are either insincere or absent-minded .
__label__noemo	Still , you must have had some subjects you enjoyed more than others .
__label__noemo	Actually , I haven ’ t been sleeping well . I am kind of out of it .
__label__noemo	I don't think so .
__label__noemo	Sorry to interrupt , but my brother is still sleeping .
__label__noemo	Get off when you get to Fair Oaks and Washington .
__label__noemo	have you tried traditional Chinese dumplings yet ?
__label__noemo	Where are you going ?
__label__noemo	Yes , bacon and eggs with buttered toast . I like my bacon very crisp .
__label__noemo	I just need a one-bedroom apartment .
__label__noemo	I was able to contact them so , if you ’ ll step into my office , we ’ ll talk .
__label__noemo	No idea .
__label__noemo	How can you say that ? But , you could give me a piggyback the rest of the way .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t understand .
__label__joy	Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , we were classmates when I was in university .
__label__noemo	Well , what kind of salary do you provide ?
__label__noemo	Some people went looting because of the blackout .
__label__noemo	I really wasn't told anything .

__label__noemo	I know , but I want to make reservations this week .
__label__noemo	Yes . I'll have a room free next week .
__label__noemo	Okay . The sooner the better .
__label__noemo	I think it's going very well , actually . We had a long meeting with them . After several lengthy discussions they decided to accept our offer .
__label__noemo	No . Not anymore.Mine is highly educated but traditional family . Most South Korea families today are a lot smaller . In traditional families , the old people are well respected and taken good care of . Ho
__label__noemo	This channel has so many advertisements , and it doesn't have any good TV programs .
__label__noemo	OK . Could I have your name , please ?
__label__joy	Yep . If you are a good singer , your audience will feel comfortable , right ?
__label__noemo	Are you in a hurry ?
__label__joy	Ok . What time ?
__label__noemo	And Sharon Stone is Batwoman ?
__label__noemo	That sounds good ! Could you call them to see if I can get a reservation ?
__label__noemo	Can you bring me a glass of orange juice , please ? I am quite thirsty .

__label__noemo	I guess I have to send it by airmail .
__label__noemo	Very good . Your reservation confirmation number is NB13579 . Thank you for booking in our hotel . Can I help you with anything else today ?
__label__noemo	No , we don't do that here . We recycle polyethylene and we make it into other products .
__label__noemo	Here's 30 yuan for my ticket .
__label__joy	Is that right ? This is a brand new outfit .
__label__noemo	Good afternoon , Mr.Stein . I wonder if you are free tomorrow evening ?
__label__noemo	OK , here is your change .
__label__noemo	That will be sent on to you within 2 working days . Then , you can start using your new card .

__label__noemo	Hi.Ed , what's up ?
__label__joy	They pay well enough .
__label__noemo	do you open all your IM tools whenever you're using a computer ?
__label__noemo	That's not a problem . Just give me your name , phone number , and date of visit .
__label__noemo	There were some famous ugly women in history .
__label__noemo	Actually , it is my mother ’ s wedding . My parents divorced many years ago . Now she is ready to establish a new family . It is a special occasion . I've got to be there , right ?
__label__noemo	No problem . Here it is .
__label__noemo	Sorry . I guess I wasn't thinking . I won't do it again .
__label__noemo	Yeah , it is ! Why is it so expensive ?
__label__noemo	Do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me , please show me that business suit , the dark one .
__label__noemo	Have you been feeling this way for awhile ?
__label__noemo	Pardon me ?
__label__surprise	A new car ! You're kidding !
__label__noemo	You should open an account at the online bank first . After that , you can buy anything online .
__label__noemo	It sounds like a good idea .
__label__noemo	What about measuring the floor for a new carpet , and the walls for new wallpaper ?
__label__noemo	Capital Airport .
__label__noemo	It ’ s easy . Don ’ t worry about it .
__label__noemo	About 6 .
__label__noemo	well , I'm looking for some summer clothes .
__label__noemo	No . It doesn ’ t . There ’ s no through bus to the national history museum Madam ..
__label__noemo	Hold on please ... Yes , you are booked already .
__label__noemo	A little over 3 years .
__label__noemo	the child must feel very longly . My younger brother is 10 years younger than me . Before he was born , I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one da
__label__noemo	Sorry , I'm busy . Why don't you ask Alice ?
__label__noemo	This is already our best price .
__label__noemo	The wagon with the water , of course .
__label__noemo	I have a good solution ... We need some new blood ! We should get rid of this president and boat in some new leaders !
__label__disgust	To be frank , I find philosophy rather boring .
__label__noemo	We're here today to present to you the results of our marketing research regarding the consumer behavior .
__label__noemo	Where did you get that idea ?
__label__noemo	Inspiration can come in the strangest ways ...
__label__noemo	Well , there are certain factors that effect people's size and weight .
__label__noemo	Bill . Bill ! You gotta help me !
__label__noemo	All right . Here's 40 dollars .
__label__noemo	maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of Beijing . I heard they are very relaxing .
__label__noemo	Some of these can wait but there are a few things that I need right away .
__label__noemo	This is the last of the milk .
__label__noemo	Do you often go home ?
__label__noemo	Is she old or young ?
__label__noemo	Can I pay by a credit card ?
__label__noemo	Oh , well . If I must , I must .
__label__noemo	Hello , may I make an appointment for sometime early this afternoon ?
__label__joy	Www , I don ’ t know how you can eat your eggs like that ! Ever since I was small , I ’ Ve had eggs and soldiers .
__label__noemo	Well , we don't usually do it , but ... I believe we can accommodate you on this.We will do the installation for free . Because we appreciate your business .
__label__noemo	Not really . His wife was able to find a good job as an interpreter , because she could speak French and German fluently . After a few months ' work , she had a better job than her husband . So in the end ,
__label__noemo	Well . No , I didn't clean it.But still , I only had the last one two months , and it broke . I don't trust auto-reverse .
__label__noemo	You have your own vehicle ?
__label__noemo	Ur , you really let me down .
__label__noemo	Do you have any questions ?
__label__noemo	Do you mind taking a photo for me ?
__label__noemo	Don't you know they've already broken up ?
__label__noemo	Your food tastes so much better than mine .
__label__noemo	I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick .
__label__joy	Do you think I should wear a different dress ?
__label__noemo	Me , too .
__label__noemo	Do you go jogging or do you go to a health club ?
__label__noemo	I don't think I'm getting better .
__label__noemo	It ’ s on Tuesdays and Fridays .
__label__noemo	I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before !
__label__noemo	Perhaps if you would be kind enough to tell me the problem , sir .
__label__joy	It's nice and bright today , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	One adult , please .
__label__noemo	Where did you learn ?
__label__sadness	I'm afraid you can ’ t .
__label__noemo	I could teach you how to cook something healthy . Frozen pizza are so bad for you !
__label__noemo	Because he stayed with me all the time that night .
__label__noemo	Oh , it is not easy to learn !
__label__joy	I am happy . I just bought a new car .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'm with my wife and child .
__label__noemo	So would I . what other unusual plants did they show ?
__label__noemo	And pancakes for you , sir .
__label__noemo	Hmm ... not so hot . They sell them here for about that .
__label__noemo	Are you sure you didn't wear it this morning ?
__label__noemo	I must confess I have an ulterior motive for asking you to lunch .
__label__noemo	No , I must know today because we have to go to press for the advertisements . Is there anyway you can speed up the process of checking inventory ?
__label__noemo	She kept bothering me .
__label__noemo	about two weeks ago .
__label__joy	Yes , that sounds great .
__label__noemo	I went back for it . But it was already gone .
__label__noemo	Not a problem . What time shall we call you ?
__label__noemo	Alright . Well . We have many units without auto-reverse.Here is a good unit . Very reliable.It has an AM / FM band , built-in microphone , recording capability , and no auto-reverse .
__label__noemo	What can I do for you , young man ?
__label__noemo	Then you'll have to think of something better , Robert .
__label__noemo	Nothing ! Anyway , you ’ re right , there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty.My lawyer tells me you ’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property , as well as the custody agreement - I keep the cat and you get the dog . So that ’ s done ... finally .
__label__noemo	I had to blow my nose .
__label__noemo	Because General , his dog , got sick .
__label__noemo	It could be bad food , but I didn ’ t feel so well yesterday , either .
__label__noemo	Very well . Why do you want to disconnect your phone , sir ?
__label__noemo	I often sneeze after having a bad itch inside my nose . Sometimes this is accompanied by an itching throat .
__label__noemo	Yes ?
__label__noemo	Should I go now ?
__label__noemo	You go !
__label__noemo	Hi Kevin , how was your year at college ?
__label__noemo	You ’ d better change it . It ’ s ugly .
__label__noemo	Well , you know what , don ’ t do it , ‘ cause the minute you do , they lose all respect for you .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry but 5 of these notes seem to be counterfeit . Look at this watermark , do you see it ?
__label__noemo	I'll help you , Lucy . Look at what I've got here . In this small bottle , there's a magic love potion .
__label__noemo	If you break the contract , then you will not receive your deductible .
__label__noemo	Yes , please bring us two steaks .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid not , he has gone out of this town on business . May I take a message ?
__label__noemo	Well , first of all , the taxi that was taking me from the client's office to the airport broke down on the freeway .
__label__noemo	Yes , I often do business through internet now .
__label__noemo	what's the matter with you ? You look so upset and tired .
__label__noemo	Yes , here is my Certificate of Nurse .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , I ’ Ve been waiting here for fifteen minutes.Do you know why the traffic is so heavy ?
__label__noemo	What was your GPA before this semester ?
__label__noemo	Watch our computer demonstration , please . You'll be convinced that our product is superior . ( After the demonstration )
__label__noemo	Why ? We can leave school earlier that day .
__label__noemo	Not today , Honey . Don't eat too much ice cream .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	You got it ! Just last night I made USD 150 !
__label__noemo	What is the greenhouse effect exactly ?
__label__noemo	I'm a teacher .
__label__noemo	I need to pay my bills .
__label__noemo	Oh , right . What a load off my mind . I really don ’ t like her .
__label__noemo	She ’ s bringing something pink for Mr . King to drink . Now she ’ s putting it ... OK .
__label__noemo	I ’ m sure they won ’ t , but that ’ s my view on gay marriage .
__label__noemo	I like the big star on the top of the tree . I ’ ll put the presents under the tree later , how ’ s the food .
__label__noemo	If you take M / T , it will take a longer time for your brother to receive the money .
__label__joy	The performance is amazing . I'm curious about how they did it . I mean the way they sing .
__label__noemo	Yes ?
__label__noemo	One way .
__label__noemo	Then what about SICC ( Strikes , Riots and Civil Commotions ) ? Can we request you to cover this for our imports ?
__label__noemo	Then , walk three blocks to Second Avenue an turn right . Are you with me so far ?
__label__noemo	You have probably noticed that our products ' prices are competitive . Besides . we can provide more superior products than other companies at the same price .
__label__noemo	You did a good job for the company . You deserve it .
__label__joy	That's great . How much is it to the airport
__label__joy	You can have a bird view of Guiling City from the top of the mountain .
__label__noemo	Yes , I would have to agree with you . It seems to offer more options than the others . But new product sometimes has a few troubles . How about yours ?
__label__noemo	Every thing for winter is 20 % off .
__label__noemo	Is it easy to learn ?
__label__noemo	What do you think of big department store ?
__label__noemo	Sorry to hear that . I think it's even better than On the Golden pond .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . Sir . Where is the No . 1 bus stop ?
__label__noemo	There really isn ’ t anything else to do right now except wait . You are already pre-qualified for your loan .
__label__noemo	You said it . We can also find some helpful advice from some experts .
__label__noemo	Then am I right in understanding that FPA doesn't cover partial loss for the nature of particular average .
__label__noemo	Don't you feel dull ?
__label__noemo	I thought you would like PE .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I'm going to be making phone calls all day . What a blast .
__label__noemo	No , the roses will be fine .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , where is the Beijing Railway Station ?
__label__noemo	A lot of people compare you to Julia Roberts . I wondered if there was anyone that you compare yourself to in Hollywood , that you've watched and thought , ' Well , they've got something I could use a little bit or could learn a little bit about . '
__label__noemo	Jenny , you're too lazy . You should do some exercise . See , you're getting fat .
__label__noemo	Can I help you , madam ?
__label__noemo	Oh , how nice.They ' re bright rooms and the house is very quiet .
__label__noemo	University graduates have difficulty finding a job too . There seems to be more and more competition in the job market
__label__noemo	Fine .
__label__noemo	Oh , that's easy . Go to www.onxiu.cn . Now , click on the link with the picture of an envelope .
__label__noemo	Yes , ma'am , how could I help you ?
__label__surprise	Oh , really , that's really something new . I'm afraid not everyone can accept it .
__label__noemo	the weather is so warm for December , don't you think ?
__label__noemo	You can get a dozen for only $ 20 .

__label__noemo	Whoa .
__label__joy	Great . I hung out with Jo all day shopping , and the went out for dinner together .
__label__joy	I need it . Thank you .
__label__noemo	Please tell us the exact time when the big fire broke out .
__label__noemo	He got a three here which means it's unsatisfactory . We should work on that with him .
__label__joy	I can ’ t believe I ’ m actually speaking to a candidate .
__label__noemo	Even silverware ?
__label__noemo	What ’ s the average income ?
__label__noemo	What will you do now ? Propose to her .
__label__noemo	Do you think going to the registration building will help at all ?
__label__noemo	I wish I could stay a little longer , but a lot of things to do back home .
__label__noemo	I think I am extroverted .
__label__fear	My father ’ s angry face always makes my blood run cold .
__label__joy	I am on my way out to a New Year ’ s banquet . How do I look ? Is my make-up OK ?
__label__noemo	I heard about that . It was successful .
__label__joy	I have booked you for one window seat on American airline flight No . 409 . Have a good trip !
__label__noemo	What's the time now ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry . This number has already been registered .
__label__noemo	Kathy ! Get back here ! I see a shark !
__label__noemo	Well , I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier .
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	110 pounds .
__label__noemo	OK , it's no anything . Do what you should do .
__label__noemo	I need the haircut . But you seem so busy today .
__label__noemo	Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .
__label__joy	If you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ’ ll save plenty of money .
__label__noemo	But I also want ya to do me a favor .
__label__noemo	Well , I ’ m afraid it isn ’ t . It ’ s a bit too well done and rather tough . Would you mind changing ?
__label__noemo	Should I bring anything with me ?
__label__noemo	People of different races are fit for quite different sports . For instance , Asians are especially good fattable tennis , badminton , diving and shooting . They seem to have been born with certain natural endowments in technical sports , in which flexibility , agility and quick reflexes are favorable .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , is this the baggage claim area from KL17 ?
__label__joy	It's my pleasure .
__label__joy	Light music and classic music .
__label__noemo	yes , we are very close . He is 12 years old and very smart . He always makes us laugh a lot .
__label__joy	You got it . Good job .
__label__noemo	Sure thing .
__label__noemo	Where do you want the money to go to ?
__label__joy	On the contrary , very exciting .
__label__noemo	That was quick ! I wasn't expecting it until later this week .
__label__joy	Sure , why not ? I could use a rest .
__label__noemo	You'd better get up or you'll be late .
__label__noemo	Yeah . I got sick and tired of her nagging all the time .
__label__noemo	Are you Elvin ?
__label__noemo	They're also one of the richest couples . They have so much money and they can buy almost anything they want .
__label__noemo	Half past 11 .
__label__noemo	What do I do with it ?
__label__noemo	To be honest , I ’ m not , and I regret a little what I have done .
__label__noemo	That ’ s going to be a problem .
__label__noemo	that's right . I am not the only one who has done this . Job hopping is quite common in the IT industry .
__label__noemo	That's fine , but do you have your receipt with you ?
__label__noemo	No problem . The professional English course is just English for Accounting . Moreover , as you know , the Atlantic Trading Company is a Sino-Australian joint venture . When I served part-time there , I became well acquainted with accounting operated in English .
__label__noemo	Haha . Don ’ t worry , Betty . So tell me , what ’ s the latest gossip ? Unless you want to keep it to yourself .
__label__noemo	What's the best time to call you , then ?
__label__surprise	But your American ?
__label__noemo	Yes , you get to choose . I would spend a little more to get a really thorough inspection .
__label__noemo	We can do that , but it will cost ... If we have to check our inventory with all our guys on overtime , you're looking at an increased cost of , I'd say , maybe 10 % .
__label__noemo	Yeah , many of my all-time-favorites were made in the forties . They've already stood the test of time and will stay with us for a long time .
__label__noemo	How nice . I hope the weather will stay like this for the whole week . I'm going on the canoe trip this weekend .
__label__noemo	Why don't you just go home and eat ?
__label__noemo	By how many minutes ?
__label__noemo	Oh , yes . I remember it clearly . Is there anything wrong with it ?
__label__sadness	Our son is gone and my heart is gone too . I don ’ t know how to spend the rest of my years .
__label__noemo	Did you promise me to get the bread ?
__label__noemo	There's always Gramercy Tavern . They have live jazz . The food is delicious , but very expensive .
__label__surprise	Ten days ? Would you please repeat it again ?
__label__noemo	What materials do I need to provide ?
__label__noemo	They are our products . Please come in and have a look . This is the catalogue for our products .
__label__noemo	Taxi ! Taxi ! Could you help me load these luggage in the trunk ?
__label__noemo	I have to finish preparing a paper for my Western Civilization class .
__label__joy	No . thank you . I can handle it , but thanks for the offer .
__label__noemo	What was wrong ?
__label__noemo	You won't catch me , because I love you . I'm not a cheater .
__label__joy	I don't think so . Let's walk by the stream . I am sure we can find the waterfall on the map .
__label__noemo	Yes , I will graduate from the People's University of China this July majoring in International Trade.Besides , at school , I am a top student.Moreover , both my spoken and written English are pretty good .
__label__joy	You are welcome ! Have a nice flight .
__label__noemo	I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much .
__label__noemo	It is a very difficult climb , because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .
__label__noemo	It ’ s only $ 5 .
__label__noemo	Was he upset when you told him you had to leave this weekend ?
__label__noemo	Oh , let me think ... Maybe two months later .
__label__noemo	I don't like the style .
__label__noemo	We're little further away from the street and traffic noise
__label__noemo	Why ? Why not ! The piano is right there .
__label__noemo	I want some chocolate .
__label__noemo	Ok . I'll take that one then .
__label__noemo	626-555-1739 . Thank you for doing business with us , Mr . Sandals .
__label__noemo	Shall I right out again first ?
__label__noemo	What's wrong ?
__label__noemo	You will be fined $ 25 .
__label__noemo	What did you cook ?
__label__noemo	Good morning , sir .
__label__noemo	What ? Why ? What's wrong with you ?
__label__noemo	That sounds good .
__label__anger	I will ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard !
__label__noemo	It's too bad . They are very delicious .
__label__noemo	I would also like to check out this magazine .
__label__noemo	One of my snow-shoes that cause on rocks .
__label__joy	That ’ s great ! I ’ Ve heard people say that before .
__label__noemo	Well , you can bet this relationship's going to be a flash in the pan .
__label__noemo	How much does it cost to hire a motorbike ?
__label__noemo	Uh ... yeah .. of course !
__label__noemo	Oh no ! I forgot about those too ! Those are Chinese sausages for my Aunt Lily .
__label__noemo	do you really think that global warming Wil destroy Earth some day ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to speak with the apartment manager , please .
__label__noemo	I am afraid it is too big .
__label__noemo	You ’ re not going to get it .
__label__surprise	Wow ! That must be really awesome to stand on the top of the mountain to overlook the earth .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . What should I wear if I want to go to an interview ?
__label__noemo	Listen to this . Mary got married .
__label__noemo	I have a reservation . My name is Rodgers .
__label__noemo	Maybe you are right .
__label__noemo	I really want to go , so I hope that she gives me my invite soon .
__label__noemo	Yes . I'm OK . I just had a tumble . No big deal .
__label__anger	It ’ s simply because the tins were damaged .
__label__noemo	Will you be free this afternoon , say from 3 to 4 ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m not too clear on some things about my lease .
__label__noemo	No , not yet . Why ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me . Mr . Li . May I ask you some questions ?
__label__noemo	Probably . I love green tea . It's one of my daily necessities .
__label__noemo	I always think everybody looks down on me
__label__noemo	Well , is it possible for you to effect shipment by the middle of June ?
__label__noemo	Do you know why I pulled you over ?
__label__noemo	But remember , be careful when you ride a bike . The traffic in Beijing can be dangerous .
__label__noemo	Let's have seafood tonight and then go see the new movie at Mall Cinema.Betsy told me it's a beautiful love story and I shouldn't miss it .
__label__noemo	Wait a second , Vince . You know what ? Why don't you let me handle it ?
__label__noemo	OK . Here you are . Is my ticket confirmed then ?
__label__noemo	I guess so . I don ’ t have any other questions . Should I sign here then ?
__label__noemo	Here's your Passbook back and the receipt to say we confiscated the 500 RIB worth of counterfeit notes .
__label__noemo	And I would say the logo is successful mainly because it comes from Japan.It is the Japanese that have made it a fad .
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . You know , we spend time doing different sports . How much time do you spend exercising ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I Went there once last summer .
__label__noemo	I hate carrying so much cash with me .
__label__noemo	Catch the 261 and get off at Sons .
__label__noemo	So you are green with envy at your neighbor ?
__label__noemo	Peter really is a remarkable expert ! There is very little he doesn ’ t know .
__label__noemo	Atlanta Daily .
__label__noemo	Vince says he can't afford anybody else . We're got to come through .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid we have to reschedule it .
__label__joy	Say , how about a walk along the river ?
__label__noemo	Can you recommend one ?
__label__noemo	They're always asking me to come home , but I think our relationship is better if we keep a distance from each other . Whenever we see each other , all we do is fight .
__label__noemo	Yes , all the insurance will be linked with your work . We will issue an insurance policy .
__label__noemo	They're pretty similar , but in different ways . I really can't decide . How about you ?
__label__noemo	I am not sure if I will be home later .
__label__noemo	I really want to take the communication class , but I don't know if it will be available .
__label__noemo	Thanks . But I really don't feel like watching movies tonight . I have to get an early start in the morning .
__label__noemo	I understand . I was in your position before . At that time I couldn ’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me . My husband seldom stayed at home .
__label__noemo	What ’ s the matter ? Didn ’ t you sleep well last night ?
__label__joy	you're lucky . Not everyone has such a great boss !
__label__noemo	Oh , David . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What should I do if he doesn't call me ?
__label__noemo	We don ’ t have enough cash , but I ’ ll take my credit card .
__label__noemo	That ’ s right .
__label__noemo	Is there anything uncomfortable in your room ?
__label__noemo	I understand . I need a lipstick , too . Do you have lipsticks in red ?
__label__noemo	You can have a try . Maybe you will like it .
__label__noemo	Why does he have such a privilege ?
__label__noemo	Here we are , Miss .
__label__noemo	It's idea of my husband . He is always banging the drum for better schools .
__label__noemo	Which one ?
__label__noemo	More people start getting on around LA .
__label__noemo	$ 200 , please .
__label__noemo	Can you describe their taste ?
__label__noemo	Sure , no problem.But I need something from you .
__label__noemo	Marquet , do you think I should enroll in the science course ?
__label__noemo	No , that's all right . I'll just look for something else .
__label__noemo	Thank you.Would you hang up and wait ?
__label__noemo	The trains aren't usually full.We can get them on the day we travel.We should buy return tickets , because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles .
__label__noemo	Please come in .
__label__noemo	Dad , I've finished my homework .
__label__noemo	Why ? Do you have to make a choice now ?
__label__noemo	What did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home ?
__label__noemo	En ... and can you speak any foreign languages ?
__label__noemo	Well , we used to talk to each other before we were married.Remember ?
__label__noemo	A week or ten days . We'd like to have a quiet room , if possible-not too near the street .
__label__noemo	We have a flight that we'll put you there at ten AM . Is that ok ?
__label__noemo	The new couple next door divorced . Have you heard about it ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I see .
__label__noemo	Thirty minutes or 30 seconds , sir , it doesn't matter , I'm ready for you .
__label__noemo	Yes , I will be home this afternoon .
__label__joy	That ’ s good .
__label__noemo	Of course.First , you must sand the furniture . You sand it to make the wood smooth.You start with heavy-grade sandpaper . Then , you move to finer-grade sandpaper .
__label__noemo	About how much will it cost ?
__label__noemo	Sure , that ’ ll be fine for me . I ’ ll come to your office so you can show how you set up these macros .
__label__noemo	Ok.Would you like a drink too ?
__label__noemo	May I help you ?
__label__noemo	that's nice . What do they have you doing over there ?
__label__noemo	I hear we'll have a new English teacher this semester .
__label__joy	January would be a good month for a mountain retreat .
__label__noemo	My IQ score is slightly above average .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll stop by if I have time later . Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines .
__label__noemo	What are you talking about ? The alarm hasn't even gone off yet .
__label__sadness	I am sorry . There is a speed limit .
__label__noemo	Of course , it's 4 dollars now .
__label__joy	I know , and normally she's trying to tell me how to clean my house . So , thank you .
__label__noemo	I want a facial . But this is the first time I've come here , so can you tell me how you do it ?
__label__noemo	Plus , you don't have to use change for the bus anymore .
__label__noemo	I'm going to do that .
__label__noemo	Oh , I'm visiting a friend there .
__label__noemo	No . You'd look under ' W ' . The articles ' a ' and ' the ' don't count in our alphabetization , and cards are generally omitted for extremely common words and phrases such as ' history of ' , ' introduction to ' , ' story of ' and so forth .
__label__noemo	Thanks . What shall I do then ?
__label__noemo	Sorry . You know the rules .
__label__joy	Cool ! Teach me !
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	I'll be checking out of the hotel in about 30 minutes .
__label__noemo	Would you consider a volume discount ?
__label__noemo	I have to run to the grocery store .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes.Erm , well , what exactly is it that interests you about the job ?
__label__noemo	Hey Mel ! Are you up for some tennis today ?
__label__noemo	Is that boy standing there your brother ?
__label__noemo	A pound of ground beef is $ 2.48 .
__label__noemo	Oh , do you go hiking often ?
__label__noemo	are you good at making decisions ?
__label__noemo	What is the orientation and view ?
__label__noemo	Just leave the stuff by the curb . The company ’ ll send a guy out next month to give you the bill .
__label__noemo	Yeah . Just pull on this strip . Then peel off the back .
__label__joy	That's perfect ! Can you say that again and record it for me ?
__label__noemo	Come in , please .
__label__noemo	How about your oral English ?
__label__noemo	Jared , I just heard about your father . How is he doing ?
__label__noemo	Really .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , could you tell me how much is the ticket ?
__label__joy	Yes , I'd love to . It ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
__label__noemo	What ’ s going to be covered in the orientation ?
__label__noemo	I see myself in a management position .
__label__surprise	Really ? I haven't heard of it .
__label__noemo	Mark is one of them . He has trouble with a girl who turned out to be a dead beat .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I've been there twice .
__label__noemo	Yes , and would you like to have seats in the front or at the back ?
__label__noemo	When is your birthday ?
__label__noemo	That makes you feel uncomfortable ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry . Mr.Huang is quite busy right now . Could I pass him the message ?
__label__noemo	What do you want to eat ?
__label__surprise	Really ? Well , I guess I have to get used to it .
__label__noemo	Sure , but every coin has two sides . Doing business through the internet is not as safe as doing business through traditional ways .
__label__noemo	As a guest , sir , you pay nothing .
__label__joy	Look , nice fresh cherries ! They are ripe and soft . I'll take some .
__label__noemo	All right . I'll take you at your word . May I suggest that you put down in the contract shipment on October 15th or earlier ? Our letter of credit will be opened early September .
__label__noemo	How about drinking soda ?
__label__noemo	No , this is the medicine for the stomach .
__label__noemo	See you later .
__label__joy	Yes , just a moment , please .
__label__noemo	Well , now I want to change the date from 24th to 28th .
__label__noemo	What would you suggest ?
__label__noemo	Yes , just over there to your right .
__label__noemo	You need to put 50 cents into the washer machine and a dollar into the dryer .
__label__noemo	On a cell phone ?
__label__noemo	Well , come and talk to me then .
__label__joy	I've always got room for something sweet !
__label__joy	I am very happy , too . It was a big game and I won .
__label__noemo	I'm no better than them . They say it's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time , but I think it's stimulating .
__label__anger	How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ?
__label__noemo	Who ’ s that boy ?
__label__noemo	I would love large curly fries .
__label__noemo	Not bad . How about you ? Haven't seen you for a long time .
__label__joy	Thank you for understanding . I promise I ’ ll make it up to you .
__label__noemo	I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
__label__noemo	Can I return the car in San Francisco ?
__label__joy	OK . Thank you for your help . That's very nice of you .
__label__noemo	Well , the Great Wall of China , the Taj Mahal in India .
__label__noemo	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	200 yuan for each person .
__label__noemo	Yes , have you forgotten ? We have arranged to go to Mary's to watch some videos tonight .
__label__noemo	Yes , I think So .
__label__noemo	But according to the contract , employees get a discount in the restaurant .
__label__noemo	OK , I'll go .
__label__noemo	Here's your laundry ticket , sir .
__label__noemo	How long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I have a friend who lives in that neighborhood .
__label__noemo	It looks like you only have $ 57 left in your account .
__label__noemo	There will probably be a book list in the bookstore . Do you have your class schedule handy ?
__label__noemo	Do you have a medium in the same color ? This one is a little tight .
__label__noemo	You haven't spent much time with Sophia lately . Are you speaking to each other at the moment ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I went there five years ago . You were still a baby at that time .
__label__noemo	What's a homeroom ?
__label__noemo	Ten hundreds and ten twenties , and the rest in small change , please .
__label__noemo	Yes , I can .
__label__noemo	Could I ?
__label__joy	Thanks for your help .
__label__noemo	Well , we have agreed on all the major points .
__label__noemo	It all depends on what you want to accomplish in your life .
__label__noemo	Thank you . And you require ...
__label__noemo	Hello , Sir . How can we help you today ?
__label__noemo	So what happened ?
__label__noemo	I don't know . Who ?
__label__noemo	And how much of your salary would you like ?
__label__noemo	It's the 11th Avenue , Park Street .
__label__noemo	yeah . I found it is so close to our life .
__label__noemo	Yeah ... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there .
__label__noemo	Mom , the water is boiling !
__label__joy	I'd like to , but I have to meet my parents in an hour for dinner . How about tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	Which service offered by your bank do you use most ?
__label__noemo	What are you doing ?
__label__noemo	American men are naturally taller than Chinese men . So even if I exercise , there aren ’ t many chances .
__label__disgust	It sure would . Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? She had horrible posture !
__label__noemo	OK , well , that ’ s all I need to know for now . If something comes up , we ’ ll be contacting you .
__label__noemo	The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow .
__label__noemo	You always work too hard , Jim . As the saying goes , all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy . You should spare some time for a rest .
__label__noemo	They're on special this week . They've been reduced to five dollars .
__label__joy	thanks a lot .
__label__noemo	These books over here are about ancient history . They might be helpful .
__label__noemo	Fine . And the charge is $ 100 .
__label__noemo	Well , all shoes are 20 percent off .
__label__noemo	not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion and fashion designer , too .
__label__noemo	that's OK . Have you sent your CV out to anyone yet ?
__label__noemo	Sure . No problem .
__label__noemo	Yes , what can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Have you taken his temperature ?
__label__noemo	Mr . Smith , did you have a good journey ?
__label__noemo	So you're going picnicking ?
__label__noemo	Do you think the trend will continue ?
__label__noemo	I think I'll try it , and give me some green salad together .
__label__noemo	What would you like for dessert ?
__label__noemo	Where do I get it ?
__label__noemo	I know . One out of every three travelers from Taiwan seems to be carrying them.They are being smuggled in by the thousands .
__label__noemo	And make sure to return my Rolodex to my desk when you are done with it .
__label__noemo	What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ?
__label__noemo	You have made an excellent choice , it is our newcomer . The tapestry is on hot sell with the design and quality . The design on it is traditional Paris architecture .
__label__surprise	What ? You can ’ t be serious !
__label__noemo	Hello !
__label__noemo	personally , I think it ’ d be better to go when you have more time . A few days isn ’ t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
__label__noemo	Yes , the letter would have a survey inside , and they should complete it and return to our office . How should I write that ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s all right .
__label__noemo	May doesn't get along very well with her mother-in-law .
__label__noemo	They always use the standard and method laid down in the contract .
__label__noemo	Oh , right . I forgot about that . Sorry , I'll pay cash .
__label__joy	Twenty .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'd like to see that pen .
__label__noemo	And also tell me how to use other switches .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'd like to know how to send money to France .
__label__noemo	Gotcha ... OK . Here they are .
__label__noemo	How much is that ?
__label__noemo	Or we can call you tomorrow coming .
__label__noemo	I beg your pardon ?
__label__noemo	Not really , do you ?
__label__noemo	A week ago ? They met last summer and now just sink . They will be married soon .
__label__noemo	See you !
__label__noemo	Yes , when you attend the interview , you should pay attention to your manner , style of conversation and expression . You should keep smiling always , being polite when you talk with the interviewer . Don't move from time to time when you sit there . And you also should know how to use eye contact .
__label__noemo	Yes , prompt and careful filing contributes greatly to the efficiency of our office .
__label__noemo	You play for an amateur team , don ’ t you ?
__label__noemo	I need to use the ATM .
__label__noemo	A friend suggested that I stop nibbling between meals .
__label__noemo	I can't find my glasses and I can't see anything . Can you help me find a few things ?
__label__noemo	How do you want your moustache trimmed ?
__label__noemo	I need to get some beef .
__label__noemo	Let me tell you what happened to my homework .
__label__anger	Don't be nosey .
__label__noemo	Do you see that girl in the red top ? She told me who you were .
__label__noemo	What was their reason for arresting you ?
__label__anger	I can ’ t believe this ! Why are all these things happening to me ! I can ’ t take it anymore ! Let me out of the car !
__label__joy	I ’ m afraid you can ’ t . you ’ Ve to go out there and walk around .
__label__joy	you ’ ll be lucky ! However , I ’ ll print out the information I got from the internet and you can do it yourself .
__label__noemo	Do you have any practical experience as a secretary ?
__label__noemo	Well , what's the matter with you ?
__label__noemo	Well , when the finish is dry , the table is done .
__label__noemo	Just two .
__label__noemo	A report says running red lights causes one thousand traffic accidents every year .
__label__joy	I'm sure you'll look grand when it's done.Would you like to have a shampoo after a while ?
__label__noemo	Fine . I happen to have 20 days for holiday , so exciting ! How many places will be visited and what are they ? Where will be staying and how about the food there ?
__label__noemo	Where are you going , Tony ?
__label__noemo	Julia , what time is it ?
__label__noemo	Thank you . Your room number is 507 , queen bed , nonsmoking . Is that agreeable to you , sir ?
__label__noemo	Pardon me . Does your hotel have a fitness facility ?
__label__noemo	We can make shipment within one month from receipt of order .
__label__noemo	Yes , it is .
__label__noemo	OK , I see
__label__noemo	just don't understand why we have to take the subway . Look at this place . It's modern enough . But it's far from lively .
__label__noemo	The operation starts at 10 0 ' clock . But you'll get an injection of anaesthesia about 30 to 45 minutes in advance . If your family comes to see you before the operation , they should come before 8: 30 .
__label__noemo	Brain Locker ? No , I don't think so . What does he look like ?
__label__joy	There are so many ancient relics in China .
__label__noemo	You are right . Some ring tone is just terribly loud . You can hear it even in the next door . It is really a kind of distraction .
__label__noemo	Hello . Could I speak to Justin , please ?
__label__noemo	I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday ?
__label__noemo	It looks nice . How much is it ?
__label__noemo	Oh yeah , that's one of my favorite flicks . I think Jim Carry is one of the funniest comedians ever .
__label__joy	That sucks . You wanna go grab a beer ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , the buildings and designs of the Forbidden City are the peak of Chinese traditional architecture , not only scientific but also suitable for living .
__label__noemo	Thanks , Hugh . I owe you one .
__label__noemo	Show me your document , please .
__label__noemo	I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex .
__label__noemo	Not much make up .
__label__noemo	I think you ’ ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . You ’ d also have to be very careful about every word you said . If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly , it would be reported in all the newspapers and magazines .
__label__noemo	They must be your parents , what do they do ?
__label__noemo	I have . I feel lucky . I look forward to dealing with overseas companies and at the same time having a chance to use English more .
__label__noemo	Do you want some salad dressing ?
__label__noemo	Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work .
__label__noemo	What airline and what flight ?
__label__noemo	Morning .
__label__noemo	What's the problem ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it is . Please put your luggage on this scale .
__label__noemo	Sure it is . I am up to my ears as time expressed .
__label__noemo	Sure . Here you are .
__label__noemo	I will have the green peas and make sure the beef is well done .
__label__noemo	How did you spend the weekend ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me . We're leaving today . I'd like to pay our bills now .
__label__noemo	Ok , here you are .
__label__noemo	Yes , it did . It went off 30 minutes ago . You slept right through it . You ’ re like a dead person while you sleep .
__label__joy	They say he can sum up like winking .
__label__joy	That's great . And the garbage , too ?
__label__joy	I can't wait !
__label__noemo	not bad . Have you heard Wendy divorced her husband ?
__label__noemo	I hope it's not gonna break into three digits
__label__noemo	Is there a bus that'll go all the way to Sons from PHS ?
__label__noemo	Come on , let ’ s try it .
__label__noemo	I guess you'll never forget today .
__label__noemo	Well ... uh ... how about a glass of juice instead ?
__label__noemo	I'll do my best .
__label__noemo	She must have been a part-time worker . They didn ’ t have much training . Why didn ’ t you register then ?
__label__noemo	Sports , medicine , education ... seems kind of random , don't you think ?
__label__noemo	How much is it ?
__label__noemo	Sure , it's spelled Office and then D - E - P - O - T.It ' s in the Yellow Pages .
__label__noemo	Right . I ’ ll see you later .
__label__joy	Great , do you have any for foreigners ? I mean English version ?
__label__surprise	Oh , how could it be ?
__label__noemo	I ride my bike . I don't live too far away , so it's pretty convenient . it's only about a ten minute bike ride from my house to the office .
__label__noemo	Please drop it at the front desk when you leave tie hotel .
__label__noemo	Hah ! For three hours while you threw up . And Femi dumped me for that . I really loved her .
__label__sadness	Sorry , I'm very near sighted .
__label__noemo	Hello , Todd !
__label__noemo	Mr Jacobs ! Lovely to see you again ! What can I do for you today ?
__label__noemo	Fine . Here's my receipt . I'd better be able to use this anywhere in the store .
__label__noemo	Hello , this is Dunlin . May I speak to Mrs Smith ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s really not necessary . I know your intention was good .
__label__noemo	All right . See you later .
__label__noemo	But I don't see it .
__label__noemo	Oh , dear . When do you think they will arrive ?
__label__noemo	That's excellent . Well , for our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan we offer some really competitive rates . The maximum repayment period for this type of loan is 5 years .
__label__noemo	Yeah . How's everything going ?
__label__noemo	I'm not , I am a vegan .
__label__noemo	I like beefsteak very much . Have you tried Chinese dishes ?
__label__noemo	You'd better take some medicine and have a good rest . I hope you'll be yourself pretty soon .
__label__joy	Sure . If I could , I would eat hot pot every day !
__label__noemo	Have you thought about graduate school ?
__label__noemo	Did either one of them win an Oscar this year ?
__label__noemo	Of course I did . Here is the receipt .
__label__noemo	Is that a kind of alcohol ?
__label__noemo	Another place you can get real insight is European papers . You can get them on-line .
__label__noemo	Willing to help , maybe , but not as helpful as you think .
__label__noemo	But look at them ! They've forgotten about the wet cement and they're walking across it to put up the notice !
__label__joy	Thank you . I'll certainly be there .
__label__noemo	What would you like to see in Beijing ?
__label__noemo	My friend's room ? Oh , I see.Thanks a lot .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry to hear that . I'll have to examine you .
__label__noemo	Steven , it's ten o'clock . I'm going to bed . I'm beat .
__label__noemo	How many credits for each course ?
__label__noemo	It doesn't matter . No one will laugh at you .
__label__surprise	Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true .
__label__noemo	Will you buy a ham sandwich for me at the store ?
__label__joy	Yeah ! But you know sometimes the weather forecast is not correct . Maybe tomorrow is a clear day . Who knows ?
__label__noemo	Let's ask someone else .
__label__noemo	OK ! I shall .
__label__noemo	No , you can ’ t do that . There isn ’ t much water in the wagon . And we need the water for drinking .
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome .
__label__noemo	I was in my friend's room talking for an hour of so .
__label__noemo	That's right , sir . Here are your tickets . Have a nice day .
__label__noemo	Emily , are you getting rushed by a sorority ?
__label__noemo	I hope she does . Do you think you'll ever get another pet ?
__label__joy	thanks for flattering me 。 i think you dance much right ?
__label__noemo	I am heading for the library . I've got a research project to do.How about you ?
__label__noemo	I do have one problem with the apartment .
__label__noemo	Do you get paid overtime ?
__label__noemo	Single or double ?
__label__noemo	I was at home with my parents in New York City .

__label__noemo	Thanks for telling me .
__label__noemo	Airmail or surface mail ?
__label__noemo	10 o ’ clock in the morning to 2 o ’ clock in the afternoon .
__label__noemo	All right . Please wait for a moment .
__label__noemo	He is everybody's type .
__label__noemo	Did you get the position you wanted ?
__label__noemo	Why is the price so high ?
__label__noemo	Yes , but do you love me ?
__label__noemo	Maybe sandalwood fan is good .
__label__noemo	That's easy . If I were you , I'd date me !
__label__noemo	Excuse me for taking your time .
__label__noemo	Yes , or you'll be late .
__label__noemo	No , I'm a nurse .
__label__noemo	Well , if that's the case , I don't mind breaking the image that they might have or the standards that they have . I can only do what I know , and live how I've lived all my life , because I'm a fairly stubborn person .
__label__noemo	Well , There're two bedrooms , a sitting room , a kitchen and a bathroom .
__label__noemo	It is really a hot potato .
__label__noemo	Oh , I like the music on your radio . It's nice .
__label__noemo	I know . I have been a subscriber for the past two years .
__label__noemo	Hello , this is Catharine from Thomson Company . Can I speak to Mr . Wang ?
__label__noemo	You can't finish in less than three days .
__label__joy	Well . Don't worry about it , I will be happy to share the taxi with you .
__label__noemo	You don't want your insurance company to pay for it ?
__label__joy	Hah , as the sales department director , you are the best .
__label__noemo	Uh ... , I'm not even married yet . How about this brown dried fruit ?
__label__noemo	Is the current asking price listed on the flyer ?
__label__noemo	Mmm ... No that ’ s okay , really . I think that ’ s all for today .
__label__noemo	You mean you and I ?
__label__noemo	That's right .
__label__noemo	I'm a little worried about my host family . You know , in the agreement I have to do some cooking for them .
__label__noemo	What's the hurry ?
__label__noemo	This is he . May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Here's 20 .
__label__noemo	That's surprising , three days ago when I went to yancheng store , I saw different kinds of textile goods . I've bought some for my wife , some for my friends.they seem very attractive .
__label__noemo	Thank you for your instruction . I really need to know the rules before I play the game , so I can know more about our company .
__label__noemo	If you say so !
__label__noemo	Are you new here ? I come to this coffeehouse often . But I didn't see you here before .
__label__noemo	do you have a brochure about the course that I can take home to read ?
__label__noemo	I'm going on a cruise this summer .
__label__noemo	What ’ s that ?
__label__noemo	Who has a crush ? !
__label__noemo	Hurry up ! Mom , I can't wait any more .
__label__joy	Oh , you look stunning . Your dress really goes well with your shoes .
__label__noemo	What are you planning on making ?
__label__noemo	Of course . Cigarettes are also taxed very heavily .
__label__joy	Come on baby , let's dance !
__label__noemo	We will transact this for you as soon as we can after the materials you have given me have been checked and verified .
__label__noemo	What ’ s up ?
__label__noemo	You know on a date , they are going to dinner .
__label__noemo	May I see the agreement first ?
__label__noemo	Well . I am really tired from packing all of the stuff all day . And it's about time to clock out .
__label__noemo	No , it isn't mine . I blundered upon it under the sofa . Do you know whose watch it is ?
__label__noemo	It only takes a few minutes . Some people like their meat well done . Others like it rare . The great thing about a barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked .
__label__noemo	You didn ’ t hear ? Spain won , two to zero .
__label__joy	Good . Let's go now .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__noemo	Good morning , Madam . Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Would you please wait a minute ? I will get one for you at once .
__label__noemo	Hey Tina . What are you doing ?
__label__joy	Working for your company , as the top administrative assistant in your firm !
__label__noemo	What class are you trying to take ?
__label__noemo	I see . That sounds fine . Until what time are you open ?
__label__noemo	I see .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . I seem to have lost my son .
__label__joy	Oh , yeah , they get to be in a movie for the whole world to see !
__label__noemo	Hey , what's the matter ?
__label__noemo	How about this afternoon at 2:00 ?
__label__noemo	What note ? I can't see . I just pulled an all-nighter .
__label__noemo	Hi , could I speak to Nancy please ?
__label__noemo	No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs .
__label__noemo	Well , I didn't clean the house and I didn't study . I stayed in bed and watched TV .
__label__joy	This will be fine , thanks .
__label__noemo	Oh , French dressing .
__label__noemo	What ?
__label__noemo	He is more nice than wise .
__label__noemo	Hey , look at the three-leg cup . I've seen it on TV .
__label__surprise	Really ? What do the companies do that for ?
__label__noemo	I have a little white cat .
__label__noemo	Following the rules of world business , the exporters have the right to inspect the goods before the delivery , while the importers have the right to re-inspect the goods after their arrival .
__label__noemo	Just a moment , sir , while I look through our list . Yes , we do have a reservation for you , Mr . Bradley . Would you please fill out this form while I prepare your key card for you ?
__label__anger	What a terrible house !
__label__noemo	Wait , you love salmon , don't you ? They have the best salmon pasta .
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . Fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things .
__label__noemo	yes , my brothe and I are going . We just finished making our itinerary .
__label__noemo	Yes , I ‘ m just reading them myself . It ’ s been a great competition . We got gold medals in three events .
__label__noemo	Thanks for inviting me , Jack , but I ’ Ve already made plans for this weekend . I won ’ t be able to come , I ’ m afraid .
__label__noemo	Welcome to our restaurant , Chez Attitude !
__label__noemo	I do , but I want meat .
__label__noemo	Julia and Anne have both taken dance lessons.They want to be famous dancer , I think .
__label__noemo	I need help finding a new refrigerator .
__label__noemo	No , I'm open to suggestions .
__label__noemo	Well , do you have a menu in Chinese ?
__label__noemo	Fujisan Province .
__label__noemo	Well , what about this Thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
__label__noemo	Then let's call it a day , shall we ?
__label__noemo	What happened ?
__label__noemo	The more expensive , the better .
__label__noemo	Please pull your vehicle over to the side of the road . Please roll down your window .
__label__noemo	Oh , I ’ m not . I ’ Ve never had a music class before .
__label__joy	Excellent . Class is over . Let's have a break .
__label__joy	Thank you for your hospitality , Leon . I had a wonderful time !
__label__noemo	Would you please have a look at the table ? I think this one fits you .
__label__noemo	Hello , can I speak to Mr.Green ?
__label__noemo	215,000 RIB is the exact balance . If you could just sign your name here .
__label__noemo	Not bad . You know I'm an air traffic controller now .
__label__noemo	It's possible , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	Are you married ?
__label__noemo	Where will we call at ?
__label__joy	So let's go and catch earth worms !
__label__noemo	I made a reservation three days ago.My name is George Smith .
__label__noemo	What ? No , I heard that he has stomach cancer . His ex-girlfriend said it .
__label__noemo	But you still look a little bit tired . What time did you leave ?
__label__noemo	Preferably at the big department stores .
__label__noemo	What do you dislike most about your job ?
__label__noemo	Yes , ten days .
__label__noemo	I don't think we will be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % .
__label__noemo	I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal .
__label__noemo	I hear that his father died .
__label__noemo	Mmm , well this is our I ’ m sorry I cheated on you package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
__label__noemo	Ok . I ’ ll send a check .
__label__noemo	In the same way , probably .
__label__noemo	Yes , yes . Here it is . By the way , is there a handling fee ?
__label__noemo	No problem , call me when you're ready to place the rest of your order .
__label__joy	Actually , there's still another opening . If you are interested , you ’ ll surely get it .
__label__noemo	Yes , I do . I think that science is making us wiser . What do you think ?
__label__noemo	Hey , what's up ?
__label__noemo	Oh , thank you . I am exhausted . Will you bring me a cup of tea ?
__label__anger	You can ’ t take me to jail ! What about my sleigh ? It ’ s Christmas Eve ! I have presents to deliver ! Rudolph ! Prancer ! Dancer ! Get help !
__label__noemo	Could you do something to advance your shipment ?
__label__joy	Oh , so nice of you to come here . Have a seat . Please make yourself at home .
__label__noemo	You are meeting trouble halfway , I guess .
__label__joy	Oh , that ’ s interesting , and but what kind of things ?
__label__noemo	And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent ?
__label__noemo	Yes . Should I take off my coat ?
__label__noemo	Sure , let ’ s just be friends .
__label__joy	A light brown suit and a pink tie today , and a light blue shirt and a blue tie yesterday . A perfect match !
__label__disgust	Hell with it ! Nobody will give it an Academy award !
__label__noemo	How about the cinema ?
__label__noemo	Are you here to make a deposit Mr Hayes ?
__label__noemo	As long as we ’ re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments . I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time .
__label__noemo	Can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ?
__label__noemo	Yes , we do . Here is your bill and receipt .
__label__noemo	I went bankrupt and I'm flat broke now .
__label__noemo	What would you like , sir ?
__label__noemo	Which is more expensive ?
__label__noemo	Don't forget my friend Andy from the office . He has nothing to do on Friday , so I invited him over .
__label__joy	That was taken at the train station before we left .
__label__noemo	I'm just thinking about that , but the trouble is , I don't know who is well in the know .
__label__joy	I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people .
__label__noemo	Yes . How are you , Anna ?
__label__noemo	She said I couldn ’ t until I had my birth certificate . Here it is .
__label__noemo	There's no particular place that you want to look at ?
__label__surprise	Is she really ?
__label__joy	Yeah , you are so lucky to have found each other .
__label__noemo	How do you exercise ?
__label__noemo	Sorry , I think you have the wrong number .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . Do you think I can get there in time to catch the 11:30 train ?
__label__joy	Those flowers are lovely , too .
__label__noemo	I know . But there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m depositing a check .
__label__noemo	Hello , Jack here .
__label__noemo	Christine , I know you ’ re new here and there ’ s a lot to learn , but you are going to have to learn to keep your work in better order . We can ’ t afford to lose an important document .
__label__noemo	I'll cook dinner .
__label__noemo	I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .
__label__joy	Who knows ! It's a long game . Look ! That was a really nice shot !
__label__noemo	This is the excellent thing about DVDs.If your son starts to collect DVDs , they will last forever . They will never rot .
__label__noemo	Are you busy tomorrow morning ?
__label__noemo	Here you are . Do you need glue ?
__label__noemo	Can I help you , sir ?
__label__noemo	How much would you like to borrow ?
__label__noemo	I went to visit a customer in IVS Company the other day . Their offices were very impressive , especially their company Logo which is all over the place . There are Logo models in metal , copper , clove , paper . They are even printed on the wall paper and the balls of the table-lights . It is really decorated identity .
__label__joy	Oh yeah , I saw the tea house the other day . I think I might go and have a look sometime . It's a nice neighborhood here .
__label__noemo	The house has a very outdated electrical system . Many of the switches and outlets do not work and are unsafe .
__label__noemo	have you been given a better offer ?
__label__noemo	He's a terrible instructor and demands a lot , but fortunately , he's an easy grader .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	That's fine . I'll get it .
__label__noemo	I knew he would win .
__label__noemo	Yes , here is the form for an expense report . Fill it out and give it to me . I ’ ll get it signed for you .
__label__joy	Plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge , and creativity . I love this job .
__label__noemo	Ah , hello , Mr Was . I'm just calling about your new credit card . It has arrived with us , so you can either come to collect it , or we can send it on to you .
__label__noemo	If your son starts to buy video tapes , he can't keep them very long .
__label__noemo	Please fill out the form .
__label__noemo	Ok , so , maybe I should call her again .
__label__noemo	Yes , she does . She works at home .
__label__noemo	Well , feel free to drop by my office any time . The door ’ s always open .
__label__noemo	And what about dinner ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , you seem to like those styles .
__label__noemo	OK . Now I'll put the dishes in the sink .
__label__noemo	Yup , it does .
__label__noemo	I want to put this curtain up .
__label__noemo	Are you new here ?
__label__sadness	No , I didn't .
__label__noemo	Yes , it is . I'm Jennifer . Nice to meet you .
__label__joy	Yes , the food here deserves its reputation . Chinese food is one of my favorites 。
__label__noemo	Here you go . Look in this flyer , or check with the produce person .
__label__noemo	That's great . Did you start dating right after you met , or did you become friends first ?
__label__noemo	Straight on , and turn right . Is it far ?
__label__noemo	That's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her .
__label__noemo	Why ? Are they good ?
__label__noemo	Maybe next weekend . She only mentioned this before she left .
__label__noemo	It ’ s time for me to go now .
__label__noemo	your office ? Aren't you a freelancer ?
__label__noemo	Wow . Too bad I don't have a clue about housework .
__label__noemo	Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ?
__label__joy	Hey , look at the tripod . I've seen it on TV .
__label__noemo	I hear you're going to Tainan to visit your uncle .
__label__noemo	They are all produced in China , aren't they ?
__label__joy	Ok . I'll talk to you later .
__label__noemo	Oh , did they ? Well , would you give us an extra key to the room ?
__label__noemo	OK , we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan .
__label__joy	He is a nice guy and very considerate . I am impressed with how smart and humorous .
__label__noemo	Did you bring that from home ?
__label__noemo	Did you vote today ?
__label__noemo	Between four and five in the afternoon .
__label__noemo	Well , I like the house , but I can't decide yet . My wife must see it first .
__label__noemo	I prefer staying at home and watching TV .
__label__joy	OK , I'll meet you there .
__label__noemo	What about the afternoon ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , I got home around two .
__label__noemo	But we could just stay there for 20 minutes .
__label__noemo	bye !
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve tried a hundred times , but I just can ’ t seem to kick the habit .
__label__surprise	Really ? It's a deal . Have you ever been there ?
__label__noemo	I have learnt how to ride a bicycle . I plan to go to the Water Park by bike this weekend .
__label__noemo	The school is a little bit too far away . I simply want to take good care of my elderly grandfather .
__label__noemo	Do you want to know something about the American character ?
__label__noemo	I have a driver's licence , a membership card and my passport . Will they do ?
__label__sadness	Hmm , that is bad .
__label__noemo	How do you do ? I'm Ted Nugent .
__label__noemo	Do you have any habits such as smoking ?
__label__noemo	Let me ask the old woman in that reception office .
__label__noemo	You do realize you are going to have to pay late fees , right ?
__label__noemo	Is there anything you don't do in-house ?
__label__noemo	it's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once .
__label__joy	bye .
__label__noemo	Which tests do you mean ?
__label__noemo	Hello , JC Consulting PLC . Chris Edwards speaking .
__label__noemo	I want to change a new car . I like Honda best , especially the red one.But it is too expensive .
__label__noemo	It starts at one and yea , let's meet there . It's the cinema on the corner of Lincoln and Main .
__label__noemo	It's down in the lobby . Turn left at exit B .
__label__noemo	For example , if your credit limit is 5,000 RIB and you owe 1,000 RIB , your available credit will be 4,000 RIB . So , your credit limit drops .
__label__joy	That'll be fine . I appreciate your cooperation .
__label__noemo	But I haven't used exercising equipment before . Can you tell us some more details ?
__label__noemo	Can you make out what he's saying ?
__label__joy	Let's say about 6:00 ?
__label__noemo	Is there a waterfall ?
__label__anger	I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you !
__label__joy	Yes . He ’ s already got the passport and visa .
__label__noemo	From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ’ s overbooked .
__label__noemo	So if we did allow the laboring force to go home early , how many people are we talking about ?
__label__noemo	I don't understand .
__label__noemo	Yes , sir . I'll bring you a menu shortly after we take off .
__label__noemo	Hmm ... I think I am ready for a new challenge . I've put a good team together at my present company , and I think If I want to take the next step in my career , it's time for me to move on .
__label__noemo	What's wrong , honey ? Take it easy .
__label__noemo	And how long are you depositing for ?
__label__noemo	Oh , is that all ?
__label__fear	Of course not . I'm afraid of them .
__label__noemo	Indeed there are bad games . But many of them are good .
__label__noemo	Which department do you want to register with ?
__label__joy	No , I didn't get hurt . Thanks for your concern .
__label__noemo	It's in a dungeon , under a castle .
__label__sadness	I guess that ’ s what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day .
__label__noemo	So how to apply for a job on the Internet ?
__label__noemo	Well , 20,000 RIB , it'll have to be then .
__label__noemo	Good Morning , sir . What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	I will think about it .
__label__noemo	Yes , most of them . We trained on a dummy system last month . A couple of people were away so we've organised two more training sessions on the live system for the whole team this week .
__label__noemo	Not , if you don ’ t want to .
__label__noemo	I see . The Fund Trading System of our Net Banking deals with both trading and information . If you use this system , you can subscribe for and apply to buy other funds . You can also get lots of other useful information .
__label__noemo	I was hoping you would come .
__label__noemo	About 18 years , I started learning when I was a kid .
__label__noemo	Here you go . I'll wait for you to get on the green before I putt .
__label__anger	I've said that I've got a problem with the circus . I'm not kidding .
__label__noemo	That ’ s bogus . I don't feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .
__label__noemo	I know he really deserves this .
__label__noemo	I'll try Chinese wine .
__label__noemo	What are you primarily interested in about mechanical engineering ?
__label__noemo	The area code is 2 , and the number is 2367-9960 .
__label__noemo	It seems too small for me , haven't you got any larger ones ?
__label__noemo	Let me help pay for gas .
__label__noemo	I have important business to take care of that morning .
__label__noemo	Yes , I did . It was one of the conditions of the insurance police . The insurance companies need to assess the risk
__label__noemo	The Cranberries . I love their music . How about you ? Do you like them ?
__label__noemo	Do you see the woman ? Is she a teacher ?
__label__noemo	I'll lend you my gloves and earmuffs until you get your own .
__label__noemo	What's up ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to have this roll of film developed .
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__noemo	Cross the street and walk two blocks west.You can't miss it .
__label__noemo	did you study at all last night for your exam ?
__label__noemo	What do you mean ?
__label__noemo	Here is your spicy diced chicken with peanuts , sir .
__label__noemo	I'm hungry . Do we have anything to eat ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to discuss the new order with you . Would you like to have lunch together at Garden Hotel next Tuesday ?
__label__noemo	No ! I said I was going to cut down which is very different . You can ’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight !
__label__noemo	Then , will you try extension 235 ?
__label__noemo	It that case , I ’ ll send it by airmail . I ’ d like to send it as a registered parcel .
__label__joy	Very Good . I'd like to do that .
__label__noemo	Good . You probably should be much better by tomorrow .
__label__joy	Thanks . I can watch TV now .
__label__noemo	What's this ? It smells fragrant .
__label__noemo	Why don't you take the CPA exam ? You are already a good accountant , having so many years of experience .
__label__anger	Yeah . Anyway he is driving me mad .
__label__noemo	Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work .
__label__joy	All right !
__label__noemo	come on ! Man up ! You'll never know until you try .
__label__noemo	I ’ d rather you didn ’ t , Miss Yang . I ’ m very busy now .
__label__noemo	Mr . Rogers probably forgot to assign a locker to you .
__label__noemo	No , but those guys like to hit on me .
__label__noemo	Nice to meet you Mr . Jones .
__label__noemo	It's often cold in December , January and February . It snows sometimes .
__label__noemo	I would very much enjoy taking a Psychology class.Because I'm crazy .
__label__noemo	I want to lower my risk of heart attack and stroke , too .
__label__noemo	Dad , I'd like to take a picture with the status .
__label__noemo	That ’ s right , although we do expect you to do a little overtime if there ’ s something important to do . The lunch break is flexible . You can go a little earlier or a little later if you prefer .
__label__noemo	Don't you think I can save some bus fares since it ’ s easy to go anywhere from here and it ’ s near the place where I work ?
__label__joy	Absolutely , i go to there to work three times a week , bend it for 6 month now .
__label__joy	Great ! B , most of the items listed are available this year . I hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts , so as to enable our timely delivery .
__label__noemo	That ’ s James .
__label__noemo	I bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch TV or read a book . Then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat .
__label__fear	The exam ! The terrible exam ! I'm not ready yet . Can you tell me how to get good marks ?
__label__joy	We'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening , are you free ?
__label__noemo	I am sorry , sir , it's not allowed .
__label__noemo	Okay , now I ’ d like to find out more about your last job . I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly , is that right ?
__label__noemo	Please wait a moment . Let me check for you.The flight is FW 711 and it arrives at 10:00 am .
__label__noemo	Did you go camping last Saturday ?
__label__joy	How do you do , Jack . Nice to meet you .
__label__noemo	It ’ s not that much . Just watch ... I ’ m ok ...
__label__noemo	I have openings on Tuesday or Wednesday . Which would be best for you ?
__label__noemo	That is a part of chinese culture , if they think you are a lovely child , they touch your head and say , how cute you are .
__label__joy	Great . I'll see you on Saturday .
__label__joy	That birthday cake looks wonderful , but you haven ’ t put any candles on it yet .
__label__noemo	The quantity you ordered is much smaller than those of others . If you can manage to boost it a bit , we ’ ll consider giving you a better discount .
__label__joy	Yes , it is very nice . I'll take it .
__label__noemo	He had better make a change .
__label__noemo	The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it sounds like everything I expected .
__label__joy	But you agreed to go out with me at last .
__label__noemo	It's about forty-five minutes to an hour .
__label__noemo	Tom , darling . You'll try not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? Please !
__label__noemo	Do we also need to punch out after work ?
__label__noemo	I'm not sure . I haven't decided yet . Can you recommend something ?
__label__joy	This is a small town , and we like to be neighborly . We know everyone who lives around here .
__label__noemo	What personality traits do you admire ?
__label__noemo	What kind of teaching certificate do you have ?
__label__noemo	Well , this one might work for you .
__label__noemo	It would probably be very expensive .
__label__noemo	Fine . I ’ ll measure you for the suit ... shoulder ... waist ... inside leg ... forearm ... upper arm ... thank you . I ’ ll prepare the suit for you tomorrow . Could you come again the day after tomorrow just to check that the su
__label__noemo	I'd like to have a berth ticket to Shanghai .
__label__noemo	Thanks .
__label__noemo	Here you go .
__label__noemo	Well , we have all kinds of beverages in addition to fruit juices .
__label__joy	But I think it's fantastic and charming . Well , you have your opinion and I have mine .
__label__noemo	Well , I need to polish up my English .
__label__noemo	Yes . Do you know what type of checking account you would like to open , business or personal ?
__label__anger	You won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ’ Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime !
__label__noemo	Don ’ t worry . I ’ Ve decided that for your birthday I ’ m going to take you shopping for a new dress .
__label__noemo	Hello , I'm sorry for calling this late . May I speak to Peter ?
__label__noemo	You seem to have picked up some kind of infection .
__label__noemo	Yes , we do . Do you have any specific needs ?
__label__noemo	Oh , that must be me ! Probably they typed the name wrong.My husband's English isn't so good .
__label__noemo	You take care of your employees . And your company offers good salaries and benefits .
__label__noemo	That will involve additional expenses for us , which we will have to pass on to you as a rate hike .
__label__noemo	It's possible because everyone wants to travel during the holiday weekend .
__label__noemo	Maybe you are right . Well , you can talk with them .
__label__noemo	I did not . It looks perfectly fine .
__label__noemo	How much do you want to spend ?
__label__noemo	I work so hard that I do not have the energy to exercise .
__label__noemo	How was your shopping trip Martin ?
__label__anger	Well , I ’ d better get back to work . I ’ Ve got a ton of stuff on my desk !
__label__joy	I am glad to hear that . I'm really pleased with it .
__label__noemo	Did you bring some lunch with you ?
__label__noemo	Not very much . It sounds too emotional to me .
__label__noemo	good afternoon . “ ginger ’ s restaurant ” . May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Good afternoon , Chloe , I ’ m Doctor Evans.What seems to be the problem ?
__label__noemo	Don't cut into them until you can feel that they're soft on the outside .
__label__noemo	How about the end of this month ?
__label__noemo	Would you please recommend some Chinese wine ?
__label__noemo	He has lost his job , and his wife died from cancer not long before .
__label__noemo	Good morning . I ’ m thinking about buying some new furniture for my living room . Could you help me ?
__label__noemo	Oh , it's ten o'clock . I'd better go now .
__label__noemo	They sell them at the shop around the corner . We can go and get some in a few minutes .
__label__noemo	Where are the workers from ? From the villages nearby ?
__label__sadness	Yes , I took my temperature last night . It was 102 degrees . But right now I feel my fevers is up to 103 degrees .
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__noemo	Me ? I ’ m even less experienced than you are .
__label__noemo	Hello , I ’ m Mark . I ’ m just wondering if you are free this weekend .
__label__joy	I don't think so . I think we had better go there earlier , or we may have to spend a lot of time waiting .
__label__noemo	Does your watch keep good time ?
__label__noemo	Are you coming or not ?
__label__noemo	Who will meet you at the airport ?
__label__joy	I see that . That was a nice ride .
__label__joy	Yes , a lot of friends .
__label__noemo	What are you buying ?
__label__noemo	I feel nervous when I face her . She looks so serious when we have a conversation all the time .
__label__noemo	I was in such a panic at that time . Fortunately another boat came along and I was saved from drowning .
__label__noemo	Would you like this to-go ?
__label__sadness	I had meetings back to back all morning . And phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office .
__label__noemo	What date would you like to fly ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry , Mr . Sandals , but we accept only MasterCard or VISA .
__label__noemo	No , thanks .
__label__noemo	Yeah , you ’ re right . Can ’ t go wrong with that .
__label__noemo	I just checked the oil myself , but you can check the tires .
__label__noemo	that ’ s correct .
__label__noemo	I actually found it in the ads , and it ’ s not too expensive either .
__label__noemo	This is our rock-bottom price , Mr . Lee .
__label__noemo	Sir ... sir ? Are you all right ? Sir ?
__label__noemo	Several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end .
__label__noemo	Really ? Then , I guess I won ’ t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
__label__joy	From the Crown's . Oh , what lovely earrings you have ! Are they diamond ?
__label__joy	Ok , thanks ...
__label__joy	I heard them warming up earlier . You're right .
__label__noemo	She told me she'd be here .
__label__noemo	Good morning , Mr Croft .
__label__noemo	Don't worry about him .
__label__noemo	What are the appliances .
__label__joy	I think our child is going to love it !
__label__noemo	Yes , I know . I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road . I would never change to anything else . The Honda I have now almost never has service problems . It runs smooth as silk .
__label__noemo	No , you don ’ t have to . But I think you ought to .
__label__noemo	What's the matter with you , Mary ? You look a bit pale .
__label__noemo	All right . When can we meet again for more specific details , Ms Chi ?
__label__joy	Let ’ s start with the basics , bread . Bread is an important ingredient here . You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria , freshness , crumb and color . If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven , or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color .
__label__noemo	"Salaries are confidential , how do you know how much money these "" other people "" make ?"
__label__noemo	That seems alright . What's the exchange rate like today ? Good or bad ?
__label__noemo	Are you sure ? He is quite young , isn't he ?
__label__noemo	I think it's my ankle .
__label__noemo	Why ? Will those be students who are leaving ?
__label__noemo	Would you be using English every day in this job ?
__label__joy	That sounds good . Let me see one .
__label__noemo	Hi , how ’ re you doing ?
__label__noemo	So when did this all happen ?
__label__noemo	Ok . The last piece is for your dessert . We're having dinner soon .
__label__noemo	Let ’ s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ?
__label__noemo	OK . Do you like these candles ? They are on sale now .
__label__joy	You look really nice today .
__label__noemo	Yes , I can be there at 6 .
__label__noemo	Yes . I'd like to check in , please .
__label__noemo	Would Chablis be all right ?
__label__noemo	Eight dolls fifty a week excluding laundry .
__label__noemo	I just found out that my husband is cheating on me .
__label__noemo	Would you like anything to drink ?
__label__noemo	I am , as a matter of fact . Do you have any special requests ?
__label__noemo	Yes , this machine is even smaller than those before .
__label__noemo	Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said I had taken a wrong bus .
__label__joy	Thank you . I will .
__label__noemo	Well . I have nearly forgotten . Mr Green from ABC Company had an appointment with me , but I will be very busy at that time . If he calls , you can tell him the appointment will be changed to next week .
__label__noemo	I hope to hear from you very soon .
__label__noemo	Have you any package tour to Italy ?
__label__noemo	I would if I knew anything for sure , but I want to take a second look .
__label__noemo	You won one million yuan in a lottery . What will you say ?
__label__noemo	Let me get the student bus pass .
__label__noemo	Hi ! Someone has reported a fault on one of your copiers .
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid I've had a terrible row with my boss . What shall I do ?
__label__noemo	No hat for me , but I'm getting this cool pair of shades .
__label__noemo	That ’ s sex discrimination . When will you get the reply ?
__label__noemo	Thank you . I wonder whether I can enjoy the life insurance and health insurance .
__label__joy	Very nice .
__label__noemo	At 8 am . By the way , it also makes a refueling stop .
__label__noemo	Here you go . Is that it ?
__label__noemo	soup always makes me feel better when I'm sick . I hope it makes you feel better , too .
__label__noemo	Ok , I will see you then .
__label__noemo	how come you're still up ? Shouldn't you be asleep by now ?
__label__joy	Very good . Well , thanks to your cooperation , our discussion has been very pleasant and fruitful . I sincerely hope that the volume of trade between us will be even greater in the future .
__label__noemo	Um ... well , where's the men's shoe department ?
__label__noemo	Should I take my shoes off ?
__label__noemo	That sounds fine . Please give me your name and phone numbers . I ’ ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . It will most likely be in a couple of days . Is it all right for you ?
__label__noemo	Right . Well , given that your colleagues are working so hard on this project , I suppose we could change that deadline to Monday morning , I won't have time to look over it on the weekend anyway .
__label__noemo	How was your summer vacation ?
__label__noemo	Do you have anything to do after this ?
__label__noemo	You thing so ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . You like Chinese style , don ’ t you ?
__label__noemo	Which way is the dining car ?
__label__noemo	Yes , please .
__label__noemo	What's her figure ?
__label__noemo	What will you bring along when traveling ?
__label__noemo	But I don't like playing the piano . And the homework keeps me busy enough .
__label__noemo	Actually , I am learning that now . But it's too hard for me . You know the four tones and the stuff . It really freaks me out .
__label__noemo	It's 40 $ plus tax per day on limited mileage .
__label__noemo	Certainly . I prefer the winter and I love plum blossoms much more .
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve ever seen a living being looked so thin .
__label__joy	Hi , Malia ! What a nice home !
__label__noemo	Looking at the ' five sense organs ' of a scooter , it can be said as delicate and agile . To pull the T-shaped pole and make it vertical with the flat board and then pull it vertically , adjust its height suitable to you and you may use it .
__label__noemo	Sometimes what young people like is different from the old . Maybe we can go visit first and then do some shopping .
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	Then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you .
__label__joy	Thank you so much .
__label__joy	Good morning , Mr.Jones !
__label__noemo	No problem . Next time , just pay closer attention .
__label__noemo	Where have you been on this trip ?
__label__noemo	I bought this toy gun from your store two weeks ago . My son played with it only twice and it broke .
__label__noemo	Okay , okay , how about one hundred dollars ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to have a sightseeing tour in South Africa . Do you provide a package tour ?
__label__noemo	Sure
__label__noemo	Did you enjoy yourself ?
__label__noemo	First class or economy ?
__label__noemo	Well , she is not to blame . It's always difficult to choose between career and family .
__label__noemo	May I have your name and flight number , please ?
__label__noemo	What kind of permanent would you like to have ?
__label__noemo	I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % .
__label__joy	I know . It was a really good deal .
__label__noemo	No , I am not a shopaholic , but a super shopaholic . And I really enjoy smelling the gorgeous clothes and new bags .
__label__joy	Certainly . Here you are . It's a new arrival .
__label__noemo	About 10 days . You can send it express mail if you need it faster . It will only take three or four days .
__label__noemo	Would you like a piece of birthday cake ?
__label__noemo	I had the same feeling when I first came to work here . but after a period of time , I feel better , I am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job .
__label__noemo	Yes . I'm going to give you some.Take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals . For that one , two tablets . And remember to come to the out patient department for a consultation in two weeks , please .
__label__noemo	that sounds exciting . Where did you go ?
__label__joy	Darling , I have news for you . Bobby and his wife , Evelyn , are going to have a baby soon .
__label__fear	I have two finals this week and one oral presentation and I'm not ready for any of them !
__label__noemo	I ’ m fine . I ’ Ve been out of town . I just got back .
__label__joy	Oh , yes . I ’ d love to .
__label__noemo	No , I really must go now . My family are expecting me home soon .
__label__noemo	If so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks .
__label__noemo	The tip is rather narrow .
__label__noemo	I have been studying .
__label__noemo	I have a question about my payment and need someone to help me .
__label__noemo	Just because Ben Johnson was juiced up doesn ’ t mean all athletes are .
__label__noemo	I would like to plead not guilty .
__label__noemo	Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?
__label__noemo	Oh , It's quite all right , I suppose . It can't be helped sometimes .
__label__noemo	Good morning . Would you like to tell me something about the computer ? I've never seen this brand before . What is your superior brand ?
__label__noemo	It won't start .
__label__noemo	Yes , but do you love me ?
__label__joy	That sounds good . They have a movie theatre there , so if we get bored , we can watch a movie .
__label__joy	Mr . Green , I ’ d like to introduce you to Mr . Brown .
__label__noemo	Can you make it on Tuesday ?
__label__noemo	For a short time . One of the engines caught fire .
__label__noemo	You don ’ t look like enjoying this workout .
__label__noemo	Do you have an account opened with this bank already ?
__label__noemo	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
__label__noemo	I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient .
__label__sadness	I was just robbed !
__label__noemo	I'm not sure yet . Is there something you want to see ?
__label__noemo	About five times a week . What about you ?
__label__noemo	yes , I am the guy .
__label__joy	Great !
__label__noemo	Yes , I guess you are right . So , do you need my passport ?
__label__noemo	No , thanks .
__label__noemo	Thank you for coming . Did you have any trouble finding the office ?
__label__noemo	OK , shrimp rolls . Do you want anything else ?
__label__noemo	I am afraid , Ma'am , you have to pay 100 US dollars since you lost the key .
__label__noemo	Right here , how can i help you today , sir ?
__label__joy	Great . It was a pleasure doing business with you .
__label__noemo	That's a good idea . Which one do you recommend ? The Pairszone ?
__label__noemo	I am from Texas . I was in China once , but it was a long time ago .
__label__joy	Fine , thank you . And you ?
__label__noemo	let me give you a little advice . You know what the topics are going to be , so prepares what you would like to say in advance .
__label__noemo	Well , it's more like she kept me busy ...
__label__noemo	Yes , I do . It saves me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines .
__label__noemo	Pretty good , I'd say .
__label__noemo	I ’ d expected it to be much more exciting .
__label__noemo	What kind of food would you like ?
__label__noemo	I would like to ask for one day off next week . Do you think the manager will agree ? I know it is the busy time for our company , but I do have some important things to handle .
__label__noemo	I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.Then , I set a timetable that's realistic.What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react .
__label__joy	Thanks . I know things are going to be better .
__label__noemo	I've paid the duty . Here is the receipt
__label__noemo	I like a person who works hard . I don ’ t like lazy people .
__label__noemo	It's Marcia Gleason .
__label__noemo	Yes , of course .
__label__joy	That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot .
__label__noemo	So you can always keep two times at once ?
__label__noemo	Oh I remember , I cut terrible calls , and you didn't say anything about it .
__label__noemo	Well , what do you have in mind ?
__label__noemo	I should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary I can prove it was my effort .
__label__joy	We'll talk about it next time . Now that everything is settled , let's have a cup of tea , and take our minds off business for a change .
__label__noemo	What is it ?
__label__noemo	Can I leave a message , please ?
__label__sadness	Hey , Ann , I am really sorry about last night . I shouldn't have said those things to you .
__label__noemo	I want to ask you a couple questions .
__label__noemo	You want to wait for the next bus ?
__label__joy	In fact , I took up dancing quite recently , too .
__label__noemo	As soon as possible .
__label__noemo	What about your mother ?
__label__noemo	Mr . : Right here is the cafeteria .
__label__noemo	Yeah . They simply had no extra money to save up or for other things .
__label__noemo	Hi Sarah , how are you ?
__label__joy	We've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun !
__label__joy	Yeah , I ’ ll probably just stay in and relax . Maybe watch a few movies .
__label__joy	Oh , Mary , come in , please . I'm so happy to see you .
__label__noemo	I wouldn't count on it .
__label__joy	Thanks , but I know falling in love is one thing while staying in love is another .
__label__joy	I have some great news ! I was able to switch to the night shift !
__label__noemo	I think that's a bunch of nonsense . It seemed ok to me .
__label__noemo	So there is something wrong with her ! It was beginning to sound like she was too good to be true !
__label__noemo	I think you ’ re right . Climate change naturally over time , but I think that human activities are speeding up the change . I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem .
__label__joy	Of course ! I really love watching football games on TV .
__label__anger	Is that pesky lady coming to the office again ?
__label__sadness	I'm not sure if we've got any now . Books of that kind are on this shelf . Well , I'm afraid we've sold out .
__label__noemo	Yes . They are completely different . Paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother .
__label__noemo	Many customers didn't want them .
__label__noemo	Um , I think there may be some leftover lasagna from the other day .
__label__noemo	Since the day before yesterday .
__label__noemo	I am going to the beech . How about coming with me ?
__label__noemo	Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother .
__label__noemo	Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I can see it.But what's on it ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I haven ’ t noticed that before . Maybe I will try next time .
__label__noemo	Is there anything in particular you want ?
__label__joy	Thanks a lot ! I will definitely do that . Is there anything else ?
__label__noemo	No , just a few minutes .
__label__noemo	Not yet . Oh , Madam , this item is no longer on sale , and this goes on sale tomorrow . Will you take them ?
__label__noemo	I like the soy sauce chicken .
__label__noemo	No problem , I once played a 2 - meter-high player successfully .
__label__noemo	I feel miserable . Can I give you money for it ?
__label__noemo	Certainly .
__label__noemo	yes , I am the guy ...
__label__noemo	Amanda told some very funny jokes . At the beginning of the party , she was being ver serious .
__label__noemo	I can ask for some advice from him .
__label__noemo	Hello , this is Wang Li . I want to know the status of the position .
__label__noemo	I'm not quite sure . What do you have ?
__label__noemo	Of course we have lots of teas ?
__label__noemo	They didn't say .
__label__noemo	Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them .
__label__noemo	That's it ! All of them have first-class quality and performance . Besides , we adopt advanced technology . Now we have developed new products . They are much better than what you have bought .
__label__noemo	As a matter of fact , he is .
__label__noemo	I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ?
__label__noemo	Well , I adjust going to have to disagree with you . A healthy body wakes up without caffeine !
__label__joy	Thank you , sir . Just a moment , please .
__label__joy	Thanks . What ’ s your name and phone number , please ?
__label__noemo	Ours is a company special in exporting leather products . And what about yours ?
__label__noemo	Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ?
__label__noemo	Will this be cash or charge ?
__label__noemo	A friend of mine is now in the big house . He was caught red-handed for selling cocaine .
__label__noemo	Could you introduce some whitening products for me ?
__label__joy	Travel by the buses ? That sounds interesting .
__label__noemo	But our order this time is very large . To open an L / C for such a large amount at a bank is costly . Can you be a bit more flexible and bend the rule a little ?
__label__noemo	But Bob is more generous and ready to help .
__label__noemo	I'm having a party this Friday .
__label__noemo	Sorry , I never go out on Saturday evening . I always watch football on Saturday evening .
__label__noemo	You should go to the dentist .
__label__noemo	Well , there's a bench under the tree.We can sit there .
__label__noemo	Yes.Here they are . I ’ Ve marked how many prints I want on each shot .
__label__noemo	There ’ s so much I want to do . I ’ Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . I just ran a search for music to download .
__label__noemo	Of course , Mr . Roberts . But , could you tell me his extension number again ? I haven ’ t got all the numbers down yet .
__label__anger	At cars ! You aren't thinking about buying a car , are you ?
__label__noemo	it's just the right size--a perfect fit ! I'll take it . Oh , no , I'm a little short . Did you bring your credit card ?
__label__noemo	What ’ s up ?
__label__anger	You know what ? You and I had no plans , so I made plans with Mark . What's the problem ?
__label__noemo	What ever you say ?
__label__joy	Thanks a lot . Here's ten yuan . Keep the change .
__label__noemo	This small town has many serious problems .
__label__noemo	Hello , can I help you ?
__label__noemo	You have done an excellent job this year and we are pleased with the results .
__label__noemo	What a pity !
__label__noemo	Yes , I do . I like painters who use will rather than watercolors . The colors appear richer . What do you think ?
__label__noemo	I like Renaldo the most .
__label__noemo	Way to go , Mary . A lot has happened during the last few months , hasn't it ?
__label__noemo	Did your teacher tell you the route he took ?
__label__noemo	What I can tell you is that I voted for our next President of the United States .
__label__noemo	Certainly.Four more stop after this . I'll call out the stops .
__label__noemo	Anything that distracts you from work ?
__label__noemo	I will get better soon .
__label__noemo	I'd like my deck to be at the same level as the back door .
__label__noemo	You guys are working around the clock , I know . That guy Dave next to Zina never leaves .
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	Not usually . I usually just order a main course and have a dessert if I ’ m still hungry afterwards .
__label__joy	thanks . I'll read through it tonight and get back to you tomorrow to sign up for a course .
__label__noemo	This is Mary . I just want to let you know that we made an offer to you . The salary is 3,000 yuan a month , I e-mailed the offer to you as well . You can let me know within a week if you accept the offer .
__label__noemo	The reading on the meter is 15 yuan .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__noemo	We usually tell each other where we are with various clients and potential clients . The boss assigns extra duties to people who she thinks can best deal with them . It ’ s also a chance to put forward su
__label__noemo	You shouldn't grab someone else's shirt . That's a foul .
__label__noemo	How may I help you ?
__label__noemo	Well , anyway , I made a beeline over to their office , had an interview with the manager , and was told to start work the next day .
__label__noemo	I don't know . It's still up in the air .
__label__noemo	Here is your bill . 150 yuan in all .
__label__noemo	I would like to have a job that is more lively than my present one . Besides , I would like to practise my English in my work . As my present employer deals with China trade towards China only , there isn ’ t much chance to speak English .
__label__anger	Oh , gosh ! I have to go to the restroom so bad ! I can't bear it anymore !
__label__noemo	OK . Please fill in this form and input you code here ... and again , please . I'll just check and see if the money has been transferred . Yes , transaction successful .
__label__noemo	When's the last time you had it serviced ?
__label__noemo	Yes , here you are .
__label__noemo	Let's go outside and talk . So Laura , do you come here often ?
__label__noemo	Ok .
__label__noemo	I'm splendid . How about yourself ?
__label__noemo	We ’ ll send someone right up . But don ’ t worry about that . Maybe the service person forgot to do it .
__label__noemo	I'll make sure and make it to the next one .
__label__noemo	Well , the sale price is $ 1 each .
__label__noemo	Yeah , unfortunately , nowadays directors are often more interested in making money than making a good film .
__label__noemo	How do you think the education you've received will contribute to your work in this institution ?
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__sadness	Sorry , but he is out for lunch right now .
__label__noemo	Sure , for at least three thousand per month .
__label__noemo	Does it look too small ?
__label__noemo	You must feel very uneasy at his home .
__label__noemo	Why don't we go shopping ?
__label__noemo	Seven dollars and fifty cents in all .
__label__noemo	We have a copy machine in our computer lab , located on the first floor .
__label__noemo	It's actually a Deposit Account that links to your Margin Account , the one you have with the Securities Company . You can transfer the money you have in your account into your Fund Account .
__label__noemo	But how will you know how much I should pay ? I mean , I receive my bills , not you .
__label__noemo	The pass is free .
__label__noemo	Well ... ? Have you thought of it yet ?
__label__noemo	Could you project what you would like to be doing five years from now ?
__label__noemo	Can I open it ?
__label__noemo	Could I order dinner ?
__label__noemo	Sorry , stewardess . Where shall I put my bags ?
__label__noemo	Lily , I ’ m not sure . Let me check , I think I spent $ 50 .
__label__sadness	I ’ m sorry to hear that.Take care of yourself .
__label__joy	You are so smart . Your efforts in the success of the plan were outstanding .
__label__noemo	Do you want it with everything ?
__label__joy	Aright . I'll talk to you later .
__label__noemo	They will tell you the aid is impossible .
__label__noemo	don ’ t worry about that . It ’ s probably of the stress you ’ Ve been under . Just take some aspirin . Combined with the stronger cough medicine , it will make you feel very tired . You shouldn ’ t work or use an
__label__noemo	Yes , here is our offer , 30,000 skirts at 200 yuan per skirt , FOB New York . You will find our price comes in line with the prevailing market .
__label__noemo	Sometimes , but not quite often .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t worry about it .
__label__noemo	In a minute , Madam .
__label__noemo	How about a comedy ?
__label__noemo	Have you ever been there ?
__label__noemo	What does this word mean ?
__label__joy	I had a wonderful time . The rooms are not very big , but they are well furnished . The restaurant is excellent and reasonably priced . There ’ s a sauna and a Jacuzzi .
__label__noemo	I ’ m looking for this book .
__label__noemo	I would love to rent this apartment .
__label__joy	That's good answer . I appreciate your being frank .
__label__noemo	But it's only a film .
__label__joy	Good start . You knocked eight pins down . But you are left with a 7,10 split . Unless you can bowl a UFO-ball on this bowl , it is going to be impossible .
__label__joy	So why not come and join us ? Lee will come as well .
__label__noemo	Sure . What ’ s your number , please .
__label__joy	Good evening , Mr . Wu .
__label__noemo	Around six pm .
__label__noemo	Is there anything that you are interested in ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to buy a toy car for my son .
__label__noemo	Don't be a smarty-pants . It's for Grandma Wang .
__label__noemo	Really ? Then , I guess I won ’ t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
__label__noemo	What's wrong with him ?
__label__noemo	It's time for your bath , young lady .
__label__noemo	( My telephone number is ) 139xxxxx345 .
__label__joy	That's a relief ! I was a little worried about it ; I left England in a bit of a hurry .
__label__noemo	That's not fair , you got all the easy questions .
__label__noemo	It ’ s fantastic .
__label__joy	it tastes great .
__label__noemo	the cost of living in London is just too high for most people .
__label__noemo	Great ! Could you please bathe them later ?
__label__noemo	Which kind do you want ?
__label__noemo	That would be 626-555-1739 .
__label__noemo	There ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price .
__label__joy	See you , Frank .
__label__noemo	What's your new girlfriend like ?
__label__noemo	By the way , please forward my mail to this address .
__label__noemo	When will you buy it then ?
__label__noemo	ok . Mmm .
__label__noemo	I can't see him . Where ?
__label__noemo	How old are you ?
__label__noemo	I told you already ! I ’ m going to get my nails done .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll get them for you at once . And could I file the report for you ?
__label__noemo	Yeah . They take the advantage of other people's hospitality and generosity .
__label__noemo	Can ’ t you be more considerate ? I need your encouragement .
__label__noemo	I'm sure you have a talent . It's just hidden .
__label__noemo	Good afternoon , sir . May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Nobody told me .
__label__joy	Good.Can I walk through this building ?
__label__noemo	Where were you born ?
__label__noemo	Good evening , Mr . Taylor . I'm so glad you were able to come .
__label__noemo	I don't think Joe has done such a thing . Don't believe things in haste .
__label__noemo	Okay . It will be a new experience for me .
__label__noemo	Hello , take a seat please . Let's get straight to the point . This is our contract . Please read it carefully before signing .
__label__joy	Ok , here are your tickets in Row 13 .
__label__noemo	Yes , certainly . I know her mother and father , and brother and sisters , too .
__label__noemo	Could you wash some of my dark clothes with yours ?
__label__joy	Nice to see you , too .
__label__noemo	What station do you work at ?
__label__noemo	I don't want to argue with you anymore . This is going to be tough , but let's try to forget that and be friends .
__label__noemo	Actually it wad taken just last year , but I had a shaved head and a beard . Can you still recognize me ?
__label__noemo	Why are there so many yellow things ? Is yellow the lucky color in China ?
__label__noemo	No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better .
__label__noemo	Just a haircut . I washed my hair this morning .
__label__noemo	Here we are . This is Wangfujing Street .
__label__noemo	Hi , Mr . Wang , what can I help you with ?
__label__noemo	Yes , in our company , the women have a two-week vacation a year , besides this , if you are a married woman , maternity leave for some months is permitted .
__label__joy	Ahhs ! I'm beat !
__label__noemo	Just use your head . If you were definitely making some big mistakes , you would be informed .
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__noemo	Thanks ! We'll sit out there then . We will just order our drinks out there .
__label__noemo	Well , if you change your mind , let me know .
__label__surprise	You ? Do you have a carpenter's license ?
__label__joy	Ok .
__label__noemo	My name is Sam .
__label__noemo	You are right . That's the Heart of Lake Pavilion , situated on an islet.It was built in 1552 and is the largest pavilion on the West Lake . Oh , here we are at the Little Yingzhou island . Let's get off the boat . Please watch your steps .
__label__noemo	What store did you get it from ?
__label__noemo	We hope you get on board with us , Please let me know as soon as possible .
__label__surprise	You ’ re kidding ! I ’ m on ! Where do I sign up ?
__label__noemo	I wouldn't mind a burger .
__label__noemo	If this coat doesn't fit , may I bring it back later ?
__label__noemo	It looks like the hairstyle of Kahn who stands beside him in the picture .
__label__noemo	After the tour I'll have a rest . And then go to find a new job .
__label__noemo	RIB 8,000 , please . Would you please tell me my balance ?
__label__noemo	Yes , Mum .
__label__noemo	Why don't you ask Bill if he can help ?
__label__noemo	I suggest you go to the Jewish Museum.It ' s not far from the Guggenheim , near Central Park . It is really very interesting.Also , there is a great museum of medieval European art further up north.It ' s called the Cloisters .
__label__noemo	You can say that again .
__label__noemo	Last week his sister was admitted to the hospital .
__label__noemo	Well , Ted , this is a very impressive resume . However , we do have several other applicants to finish interviewing before we can make a final decision . We ’ ll call you by Friday , if that ’ s all right .
__label__noemo	Yes , they are .
__label__noemo	Thank you . I hope to hear from you as soon as possible .
__label__noemo	I'm happy to hear that . Here is your key . Just dial 0 if you need anything .
__label__noemo	Hi , my sweetheart . It ’ s Dad .
__label__noemo	Show me your torgue.What did you eat yesterday ?
__label__noemo	No , I am the only child in my family .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__joy	And I can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend .
__label__noemo	Umm . too shiny . And I wear pantyhose with my shoes so let ’ s look for a closed-toe shoe .
__label__noemo	Good morning , Maintenance Department .
__label__anger	They were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and I ’ m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ’ Ve had all day .
__label__noemo	My mother and my wife are always holding different ideas .
__label__joy	Very good .
__label__noemo	Sure . Okay , here is the website .
__label__noemo	I will explain it in detail in the next class . Could you preview it ?
__label__noemo	You're such a dreamer ! You think that you can spread the word of jazz in an underpass ?
__label__noemo	I can't remember , but I've got the receipt somewhere . Would you like to see it ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry . According to the regulations , a passenger can only take two bottles on to the aircraft . So you cannot take so many .
__label__noemo	I see , please wrap it .
__label__noemo	Here you go . Same pan , but with a state-of-the-art , heat-resistant plastic handle .
__label__noemo	Is there a problem with it ?
__label__noemo	Let me calculate the price for you . I can give you a 15 % discount if you buy the seven units.Let ' s see here . Your total would be 5929 dollars .
__label__noemo	I will .
__label__noemo	Are you going to give up your job ?
__label__noemo	maybe people don ’ t like to have friends that are all the same . Most people like a little variety in their lives-including a variety of characteristics in their friends .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . Where are you going ?
__label__noemo	You look great ! However , I think you are a little over dressed for dinner .
__label__noemo	When will you be paying these fees off ?
__label__noemo	Sorry . We're out of size L's .
__label__noemo	Oh ... football . Football is cool . I usually try to catch the World Cup finals .
__label__noemo	But Sarah says she does not care , so long as he loves her .
__label__noemo	Yes I am . And you ...
__label__joy	Oh , my niece will love her ! How much for her ?
__label__noemo	We're going to the beach for the weekend .
__label__noemo	No , I am from France .
__label__noemo	Yes , we ’ ll do so .
__label__noemo	We plan to rent some of them out at the hourly rates .
__label__noemo	The large one .
__label__noemo	I hope my baggage aren't overweight .
__label__noemo	He can spend more time with his grandchildren .
__label__joy	Look , most of the maple leaves have turned red .
__label__noemo	Yes , it is . But even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done.Have you ever been in an emergency room before ?
__label__noemo	Try them if you like .
__label__joy	Maybe you won't believe this , but it was made by my grandmother .
__label__joy	No . Thank you . It looks a bit too dangerous for me .
__label__noemo	Red restaurant . Do you want to make a reservation ?
__label__noemo	Yes , sir .
__label__noemo	My uncle owns a farm and I ’ Ve spent some time working with him . I love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields .
__label__noemo	Sorry , we have two Smiths , Robert Smith and Jim Smith , which one would you like to speak to ?
__label__noemo	I'm not sure , is this our stop ?
__label__noemo	Ok . Next thing is laying the corner-stone for the new plant at 10 AM . At 12 AM , back here for lunch .
__label__noemo	Maybe . I ’ m not sure why they have fashion shows like this . Hardly anyone will buy those clothes . The clothes you see are nothing like the ones that ordinary people wear . It seems like a waste of money .
__label__noemo	Sir , the restaurant you seek is right here . This hotel has a three-star restaurant .
__label__joy	Bob ! I hear your team won the match .
__label__joy	Which day would suit you ?
__label__noemo	Wo , wo , that certainly is a lot for a young man to take on .
__label__noemo	That word is pronounced kitchen .
__label__noemo	You look tired .
__label__noemo	Yes . I suppose it's best to stop .
__label__noemo	Oh . I guess you get what you pay for . How long did you stay there ?
__label__noemo	Could you show me how to operate this fax machine ? I am going to receive some urgent fax from a company .
__label__noemo	How many children do Cindy and Ron have ?
__label__joy	Very big and exciting , but very crowded , too .
__label__noemo	Mm , they taste delicious . Let's settle the bill .
__label__noemo	Both of them are luminous with a time reminder function . They don't need battery , because they can absorb energy from the sun .
__label__noemo	Of course you do . They are silly stories just for little kids like you .
__label__noemo	That's right .
__label__noemo	You see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening .
__label__noemo	How have they decided to deal with that ?
__label__noemo	What was your childhood like ?
__label__noemo	China provides the bulk of our product inventory , for sure . We import more than 40 different items from China . Most of the imports that come out of China are low-grade plastics or toys . Japan produces many electronic exports , Germany produces excellent mechanical exports .
__label__noemo	Would you like to have your room on the top floor ?
__label__noemo	Well , their team work is well worth learning .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t mind paying high rent to live in New York .
__label__noemo	What about a Gila monster ?
__label__surprise	Why ? What happened ?
__label__joy	Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 .
__label__noemo	Your company is very well respected . About how long have you been in business ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s okay .
__label__noemo	Well , I ’ d just like you to help me with the holiday schedule .
__label__noemo	OK . Here is my application form and all the documents .
__label__noemo	yes , I hope so . I am studying for my BELTS right now .
__label__noemo	It ’ s L-e-e .
__label__noemo	My paper is on the influence of television on children .
__label__noemo	It's too high . I can't reach it . Could you help me ?
__label__noemo	Sure , no problem . Do you want me to edit it for you ?
__label__joy	It's nice to meet you . Thanks for coming .
__label__noemo	I graduated from Songhua University .
__label__joy	Oh , congratulations . Sounds like you've found your soul mate .
__label__joy	I'll take a dozen .
__label__noemo	We take very good care of this particular pump . It's a crucial part of our process . We clean it and flush it through at the end of every shift , We check the high pressure seals , recalibrate the gauges and lubricate all moving parts weekly . We replace the gaskets every month .
__label__joy	All right . Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Good . Can I walk through this building ?
__label__joy	Then I will send it by air , thank you .
__label__noemo	Oh good we are almost there . The museum is round the corner from the Post Office .
__label__noemo	I was robbed this morning .
__label__noemo	If we built more roads , people would just fill them with cars again . I think we should discourage people from using their cars .
__label__noemo	What is it ?
__label__noemo	Is it ready to eat ?
__label__noemo	You're making a federal case out of it . One unhealthy love affair can't ruin anything . It could even make your life more interesting .
__label__joy	So do you feel happy now ?
__label__noemo	I think I've looked everywhere , but I haven't seen a swimming pool here .
__label__joy	Forget it . I'll see you at 11:30 am .
__label__noemo	Neither the kitchen nor the bathroom plumbing is working well .
__label__noemo	Is your address still 1150 Lake Road ?
__label__noemo	Yes , he's really pushed me too far .
__label__noemo	Last time I wore extra small was when I was in fifth grade .
__label__noemo	I guess that's just the luck of the draw .
__label__surprise	It's amazing .
__label__noemo	Hi Steve , it's nice to meet you . I hear that you're looking for an apartment , and I just rented a two-bedroom downtown . I'm looking for a compatible roommate .
__label__surprise	Can you believe her ? She is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet .
__label__noemo	Sure . I took such courses as accounting principles , commercial accounting , cost accounting , industrial accounting , electronic data processing accounting , and accounting involved in foreign capital enterprises .
__label__noemo	Well , here is your breakfast !
__label__noemo	I agree . I like his brother , Paul . They are not alike .
__label__noemo	My country is well know for being very flat . There are some hills in the southeast of the country .
__label__noemo	Is this one suit for you ?
__label__noemo	Would you please teach me how to use the computer ?
__label__noemo	I will try my best to persuade her to reconsider the divorce . But are you sure that from now on you will be faithful to her forever ?
__label__noemo	I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live .
__label__noemo	Honey , do you have a second ?
__label__noemo	You mean you can read and write both of them ?
__label__noemo	I had to go get a cavity filled today .
__label__noemo	OK , we've finished . Can you get your father and brother ?
__label__joy	That is good to hear !
__label__noemo	No , I'd definitely try to restore it to its original state . I love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years ago would be a great way to feed my imagination even more !
__label__noemo	I came here to get a chest X-ray .
__label__noemo	China .
__label__noemo	Good afternoon.Swiss Airline.Miss Grown speaking . Can I help you ?
__label__joy	There are times of games planned , should have a grand time .
__label__noemo	don't worry . I think in most cases , children are the glue that keeps a family together .
__label__noemo	On Saturday , you'll leave the hotel for sightseeing . Miss Lu will be your guide .
__label__sadness	I had to move it , so that I can get my bike through .
__label__noemo	Go for it .
__label__noemo	I heard you've found a new job .
__label__noemo	Why do you say that ?
__label__surprise	You ? You are full of hot air .
__label__noemo	For my part , xiangqi . Maybe it's because my girlfriend is Chinese .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__noemo	Now Mr . Tylor's on the line . Go ahead , please .
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry , dad . But you can ’ t do that . It ’ s for me to decide .
__label__noemo	How many days does it take to Dalian ?
__label__noemo	I feel the same way .
__label__joy	Thanks for saying . Do you have any ideas which necklace I should wear ?
__label__noemo	Just take your clothes off from the waist up and put this gown on , with the opening in the back .
__label__noemo	Don't move from time to time . It is very impolite and will make you nervous .
__label__noemo	It's very kind of you to show me around .
__label__noemo	Just take it easy . Come on with me .
__label__noemo	When are you going on vacation ?
__label__noemo	Really ?
__label__noemo	Did you report it on your Continued Claim Form ?
__label__disgust	But I think Eddy is going too far !
__label__noemo	I need to buy a new refrigerator today .
__label__noemo	I want to say goodbye . I ’ m leaving for America tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Why did you buy that painting ?
__label__noemo	Here ’ s the $ 5.00 .
__label__noemo	I ’ m worrying about how to move all of my household stuff . You know , I have a lot of stuff .
__label__noemo	Yeah .
__label__noemo	Out of the frying pan and into the fire .
__label__noemo	It's easy . Press O and then P . Then it will ask you for your password .
__label__joy	You are right about that . It's quiet and very convenient . You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes ' walk . There's a grocery store , a book store , a gym , and many restaurants along the street .
__label__noemo	We need a person with ability and flexibility .
__label__noemo	What about the surrounding area ?
__label__noemo	let's get started with this game then .
__label__noemo	I know that . But that has nothing to do with being unlucky . Those who created the virus are deliberately making fun of people .
__label__noemo	I don't think so.There ' re so many familiar characters and they sound just like Chinese .
__label__noemo	And she is thin , isn ’ t she ?
__label__noemo	Room service.What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	For how many people ?
__label__noemo	We have made some adjustment on the prices . And this is renewed price list .
__label__noemo	Yes , of course I can , Penny . Is there any water in this kettle ?
__label__noemo	How about this set ?
__label__noemo	I sure do . How about American Express ?
__label__noemo	No . Thanks . Can I leave a message for Mr . Smith ?
__label__noemo	Hello , this is my passport .
__label__noemo	Yes . What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Is everything okay ? You seem a bit preoccupied .
__label__noemo	How do you find the prices there ?
__label__noemo	As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . To do this , we place our hands over the person ’ s chest , and press down firmly two or three times .
__label__noemo	Just make sure you never touch the wire .
__label__noemo	I really admire those who made such great inventions !
__label__noemo	Good morning ! May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Anything else ?
__label__noemo	Hello , Mr . Jones .
__label__joy	Okay . Don't forget to call Susan .
__label__joy	Awesome , we went to Australia and New Zealand .
__label__joy	OK . Put on something by the Backstreet Boys !
__label__anger	It smells like an ashtray in here !
__label__joy	Well , it's sounding good ! I'm looking forward to that .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid Mr Wilson would like to speak to Mr Brown right now.He ' s got an urgent matter to discuss with Mr Brown without delay .
__label__noemo	It's still too dark . Any brighter colours ?
__label__noemo	What did the woman ask you ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me , can you tell me the way to the Forbidden City , please ?
__label__noemo	No . Well , I don't know.But Taiwan is so crowded . Don't you miss life in America ?
__label__noemo	Waiter , bring me the menu , will you ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I know that place . It ’ s only two minutes drive .
__label__joy	Those are really cute .
__label__joy	I can't wait to go skiing tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Sure , more elegant and taller .
__label__noemo	That's for the breakfast you ordered from the service .
__label__joy	That ’ s useful to know . Thanks . I ’ ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .
__label__noemo	Did you punch in ?
__label__noemo	I'm very sorry I can't .
__label__noemo	No , your uncle Jack is my brother , Bill is my brother-in-law , your mom's brother .
__label__joy	Sure , why not ?
__label__noemo	I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U . S of A , although I have some Colombian heritage .
__label__noemo	Room Service . May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Well , it's because in most countries liquor has a higher tax on it .
__label__noemo	Hi , Sam . I want to buy a pet . Do you have any ideas ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me.We ordered too much.May we take the food home ?
__label__noemo	Don't you think it's too bloody ?
__label__noemo	Oh , it ’ s almost eleven twenty .
__label__noemo	Yes , sir . Most of us had positive review in last quarter . Take Fred and David for examples . Both of them try their best to achieve the best . Their progress is distinct , especially in last quarter .
__label__noemo	It's a bit loose . Do you have a middle size ?
__label__noemo	Is there a problem ?
__label__noemo	I'll let the bellboy know . Don't worry , he's very strong .
__label__noemo	Do you know what kind of internet you would like to get ?
__label__noemo	Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but Mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class .
__label__sadness	I've got a sore throat and my chest hurts .
__label__noemo	Now , if you'll just sign here .
__label__noemo	01088256798
__label__noemo	Okay , now I ’ d like to find out more about your last job . I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly , is that right ?
__label__noemo	Certainly .
__label__joy	Ha ha , right . Sounds to me like you ’ re more excited about the dumplings than seeing your Grandma .
__label__noemo	Will I get notification that I qualify for unemployment ?
__label__noemo	Anything of value in it ?
__label__noemo	I need to talk to you about that new secretary you ’ Ve hired . I think I ’ m going to have some problems working with her .
__label__noemo	Sure . It's probably the skiing show . Adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
__label__noemo	Yes , your check will be a little late in getting to you .
__label__noemo	You are welcome .
__label__noemo	If you make mistakes in your job , you'll be fired . Is that right ?
__label__noemo	Welcome to ABC electronics . First , let me go over what we do in the department during a typical workday .
__label__joy	Thank you.Good evening , Mr.Dean .
__label__joy	I hope so . I really hope so .
__label__noemo	No problem .
__label__noemo	No trouble at all .
__label__noemo	Yes , I know where the bookstore is .
__label__noemo	Adidas ? They wear well . Try this pair , Size 38 , please .
__label__noemo	like what ?
__label__noemo	Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry .
__label__noemo	It's the best choice ; plus , it won't tie up your phone line .
__label__joy	You're so old-fashioned . That's what people used to think about people from another country !
__label__noemo	He ’ s nearly 90 .
__label__noemo	Don't ' Uh , Dad ' me . Sit down and have some lovely breakfast .
__label__joy	Have a nice day , Ma ’ am .
__label__noemo	What's the problem ?
__label__noemo	I went to Harvard University .
__label__noemo	The Cathedral ?
__label__noemo	What is that ?
__label__noemo	Have you been eating properly ? Eating the right kind of food is important for your health , you know .
__label__noemo	Why don't we go down to the pool ? It's not too far from here .
__label__noemo	Yes , I got married to a man that I met shortly after I divorced my first husband .
__label__noemo	It's OK . It seems we have a lot in common .
__label__noemo	Really .
__label__noemo	Yes , I know I'm wrong . But I swear that the affair lasts only for two months . And I still love my wife . I couldn't live without her .
__label__noemo	Didn't I ask you to clean it up earlier ?
__label__noemo	What else do you want ?
__label__noemo	You're right . They are spinning pretty fast . Aren't they getting dizzy ? What if they fall ...
__label__noemo	I don't think that they had their act together . They didn't seem well prepared .
__label__noemo	You are very welcome . Have a good day .
__label__joy	Ok .
__label__noemo	Not even for an hour ?
__label__noemo	Oh , you want my chocolate cakes , so to speak !
__label__noemo	I ’ ll look for a ticket for you , too .
__label__noemo	I'll call again in thirty minutes .
__label__noemo	How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet ?
__label__noemo	I heard that James was fired because he got a keep back of 20 thousands dollars from a vender .
__label__noemo	Yes , we are on the same plane .
__label__noemo	How could you manage to pass the exam ?
__label__noemo	I must , if I want to pass the course .
__label__noemo	Well , it has got low mileage.The tires are in perfect condition and it's in excellent shape .
__label__noemo	How many hours do you work a week ?
__label__joy	Very good . Would you like anything else ?
__label__noemo	Well missy , the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
__label__noemo	Oh , I understand . She cooks , cleans and takes care of children . Is that right ?
__label__joy	Oh , thanks , Mr . Kaufman . We look forward to your visit .
__label__noemo	Do you want to sign for a Korea language class ?
__label__noemo	Yes , sir .
__label__joy	You and Tom also make a great couple .
__label__noemo	Straight , I think , and about average length .
__label__fear	It must be a haunted house.Are you frightened ?
__label__noemo	Well , you could change your Australian dollars into , say British pounds and then open an account . How does that sound ?
__label__noemo	Please show me your passport and Residence Permit .
__label__noemo	That cat .
__label__noemo	yes , we can look at the computer and computer menu at the same time.And this will help us understand both better .
__label__noemo	My polling place is at the park up the street .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes , that will help me a lot .
__label__joy	That sounds fine . If you could give me the name and address of the dealer I'll go over there now and see what they've got .
__label__sadness	My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight .
__label__noemo	I'd advise you to listen to your wife . She will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice .
__label__noemo	Oh , what a coincidence ! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it . He likes children and always wants a child of his own .
__label__noemo	It may be part-time work as a waitress or something.It would be illegal , but sometimes waitresses make a good salary .
__label__joy	I will . Thanks . That's sweet of you .
__label__noemo	That ’ s right , or I ’ m going to spend a lot of time walking .
__label__noemo	Yeah , child is the matter . Don't tell Jenny the truth , only tell her the white lie . When she grows up , you find the suitable opportunity to tell her .
__label__noemo	Hi , John , how was your vacation ?
__label__noemo	Never do that again .
__label__noemo	Want to send out for some Chinese ?
__label__joy	Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks .
__label__surprise	Really ? Why ?
__label__noemo	It was fun for me , too.It gave me a chance to get away from my routine and do something a little different .
__label__noemo	Waitress .
__label__noemo	I believe you can do a good job .
__label__noemo	I don't think I performed well .
__label__noemo	Yes , you're at the right stop .
__label__noemo	I think you should work out more too .
__label__noemo	OK . What are you going to have to eat ?
__label__noemo	I surely do . They must have had advanced machines in ancient China to do that .
__label__noemo	The red one .
__label__joy	Merry Christmas , Bill !
__label__noemo	Yeah man , I ’ m starving !
__label__noemo	No , I think the music is too fast .
__label__noemo	I lived there for three years . I like summer but I don't like winter .
__label__noemo	Excellent . Do you serve breakfast in the hotel ?
__label__noemo	How many places have you worked altogether ?
__label__noemo	But you ’ re crazy about him .
__label__noemo	I'll try it right now .
__label__noemo	( Benjamin starts to run and then he seems to remember something and returns . ) Ugh , excuse me , where is the Lost and Found ?
__label__noemo	I would like to be in a managerial role , ideally working do6ely with external clients . I have worked in client-facing roles for more than two years and I enjoy the challenge of keeping the customer satisfied . I think Ifs something I ’ m good at . Finally , I ’ d like to be on the right career path towards eventually becoming a senior manger within the company . I ’ m very aware that these are ambitious goals , however I fell through hard work and dedication they achievable .
__label__noemo	Ah-ha , I thought so .
__label__noemo	I want to enrich my knowledge in management . The United States is an ideal place for me .
__label__noemo	Come on you're confusing me.Give it to me straight .
__label__noemo	we ’ re negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Right . Here it is .
__label__noemo	Do you charge for delivery ?
__label__joy	It's my pleasure .
__label__noemo	Now we have to walk all the way down to the end of the street .
__label__noemo	I know . It's a major symbol of China .
__label__noemo	That much ! Would you mind letting me have a look at it ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I didn ’ t know that ! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
__label__joy	Thank you . I ’ ll put the call through for you . Hold on the line , please .
__label__noemo	Can you describe for me , where you were sitting ?
__label__noemo	You said it.No one can match Shakespeare in artistic talent .
__label__joy	Of course I miss Grandma , too . I bet she ’ s gonna teach me how to play Mahjong ! Hey , Dad , are you going to buy me firecrackers this year ? We ’ re going to have the best fireworks ! I ’ m really looking forward to lighting them !
__label__noemo	I see . Well , it's nothing spectacular , but it's pretty cheap for an apartment in a decent neighborhood ... O . K . , I think I'll take it .
__label__noemo	I really think we should take a tour of the White House .
__label__noemo	Yeah , it's really cute . But why a monkey suit ? Is Hello Kitty having an identity complex ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry ; he's out at the moment .
__label__noemo	The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on .
__label__noemo	Hi , Mary . I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th , the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games . Is it true ?
__label__noemo	That's fine . I don't have much time to waste .
__label__noemo	We're supposed to check in at the Air China's counter 30 minutes before take-off , Joe .
__label__noemo	How can you be so sure ? You haven ’ t been together with her , have you ?
__label__noemo	I sometimes use traveller ’ s cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash .
__label__noemo	You had better get a grab instead of getting upset about little things .
__label__noemo	Yesterday I met Mary , and she told me her husband often made pass at his secretary .
__label__noemo	Oh don ’ t worry , I ’ ll be fine .
__label__noemo	Both , doctor . I never get to sleep until two o'clock and I always wake up at five .
__label__noemo	Are you rushing me ?
__label__noemo	Hi there , I ’ m Bill Gotcha , the owner of Gotcha Enterprises . Did you find your way here OK ?
__label__noemo	No , not really . Why do you ask ?
__label__noemo	Welcome to Al's Bakery . What can I get you ?
__label__noemo	Anne ! I haven't seen you for ages.How ' Ve you been ?
__label__noemo	Why not ?
__label__noemo	The tests showed nothing wrong . A slight viral infection .
__label__noemo	Well , George . I guess I am . Why do you ask ?
__label__noemo	Tomorrow is my first day at work , what do you think I should be wearing ?
__label__noemo	It has a receiver , a CD player , a double cassette deck , and a turntable .
__label__noemo	I will , good luck .
__label__joy	Yeah , yeah , yeah . Hi , Mary . How are you ?
__label__noemo	I wish it was a nicer day today .
__label__noemo	OK . Can you prepare things for the meeting in the meeting room ? Make enough copies of the handouts .
__label__noemo	OK . Could you give me a receipt ?
__label__joy	Really ? Thank you .
__label__noemo	It seems that they really enjoy to go faster , higher and further .
__label__noemo	I was there .
__label__noemo	Can I see all of my test results at once ?
__label__noemo	Will you send the letter to the chairman of the committee ?
__label__joy	Come on , fellows.Let ' s enjoy my wife's cooking !
__label__noemo	I ’ d like extra prints made of these photos .
__label__noemo	Did you panic at the time ?
__label__noemo	Hey , I play basketball with a bunch of friends twice a week . It's great exercise and it's fun too . Why don't you come out and play with us ?
__label__noemo	I just need to take your picture .
__label__joy	Don ’ t worry . I will call Hanson , and ask him to help you .
__label__noemo	On the bottom shelf in the cupboard under the sink .
__label__surprise	Really ? That's too bad ! You should be at home in bed . It's really important to get a lot of rest .
__label__joy	So long . Thank you for shopping here .
__label__noemo	Please dissolve one pill in water before taking it .
__label__noemo	( Handing her a menu ) Your waiter will be here in a minute to take your order .
__label__noemo	I'll participate in a quiz about the 29th Olympic Games in Beijing . It will be held tonight . Will you come ?
__label__noemo	Could we go over some things , because I think my test score is wrong .
__label__noemo	I could handle everything pretty well in the old position , so I decided to move around and learn something new .
__label__noemo	Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion .
__label__noemo	How was your test ?
__label__joy	Very well , thanks , I will probably finish next week , but this is still a lot of work , I have been worked on in for six months , and i ' m so closed to end . I can feel it .
__label__noemo	So , tell me , what makes you think we should give you a raise ?
__label__surprise	Only $ 2,100 ? Okay , let me have one .
__label__noemo	Perhaps I could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . He watches too much Tv too .
__label__noemo	I'll try my best .
__label__noemo	Well , that's a thing .
__label__noemo	Sorry . No . You should go to the other counter .
__label__noemo	I ’ m awesome . Well , I guess that ’ s my answer , isn ’ t it .
__label__noemo	What exactly did you see ?
__label__joy	thank you . that would be great .
__label__noemo	No , I never wear suit in my everyday life . I just want one to take part in my sister ’ s wedding ceremony .
__label__noemo	No , I didn't .
__label__noemo	I don't know . He's a little depressed . He's having a hard time finding a job right now .
__label__noemo	Sure , my name is Ana Ferris . Don ’ t worry about it , it happens to me all the time . I ’ m terrible with names too .
__label__noemo	Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
__label__noemo	I---I don ’ t feel like saying it .
__label__noemo	Has Robert ever missed coming to one of our parties ?
__label__noemo	We deal with kid's clothing , women's clothing , and men's clothing . You name it we deal with it .
__label__noemo	Good morning . How can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I guess I really did get ripped off .
__label__noemo	Waitress , can I have the bill , please ?
__label__noemo	Well , if you change your mind , let me know .
__label__noemo	Macrohard , eh ?
__label__noemo	Yeah . Sometimes I just cannot accept his behavior .
__label__noemo	Yes , I find jogging does good to me , so I keep on doing it .
__label__disgust	I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me .
__label__noemo	What do you suggest ? I can ’ t afford to quit my job until I get a new one .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__noemo	English and computer skills are comparatively important to this post , especially in the starting period . Wharfs your ability in these two fields ?
__label__noemo	So , who do you work for ?
__label__joy	I'm going to throw a party tomorrow night . Would you like to come ?
__label__noemo	And why not ?
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__noemo	Yes , I would like to have a suit made to measure .
__label__noemo	OK . It sounds fine .
__label__noemo	In a while , crocodile .
__label__noemo	The journey around the M25 is 33 miles and then 3 extra miles to get to the airport . So how many miles is that together ?
__label__noemo	I'll be honest with you , our budgeted cost can't exceed more than $ 150 per unit.That is our bottom line . If you can meet that price , you've got the deal.Otherwise ...
__label__noemo	Whose part do you think is best played ?
__label__noemo	I'm interested in applying for a credit card with you .
__label__joy	Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free .
__label__noemo	Is it gonna to rain tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	The dispensary closed . Here is the given prescription .
__label__noemo	Can I take a message , Mr Laing ?
__label__noemo	I just bought these slacks a week ago . And I am a regular customer here . Can you make an exception this time ?
__label__noemo	No , we didn't . Last week we went to see that movie about a man's struggle against mental illness .
__label__noemo	Is this seat taken ?
__label__noemo	I tend to only eat grapes and apples .
__label__noemo	There are so many here.The men with red hats are the porters .
__label__sadness	I ’ m sure they are . Oh , and a local man won the lottery . I ’ m so jealous ! I wish it were me ! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I ’ m amazed that I haven ’ t even won a small prize yet . It ’ s so unfair !
__label__noemo	Any other benefits ?
__label__noemo	Victory for me , I bought it for 30 bucks just yesterday !
__label__noemo	How much is it ?
__label__noemo	They look fake .
__label__noemo	Maybe yesterday you've received a man's woos . He's called ' Beast ' ?
__label__noemo	How much is it ?
__label__noemo	Of course . How much would you want to insure these books for ?
__label__surprise	What do you mean you already voted ?
__label__noemo	Is this the right bus for the Grand Hotel ?
__label__noemo	And you'd better not cry or you'll have black streaks running down your face .
__label__noemo	It's very considerate of you to do so . Do you have any laundry today ?
__label__noemo	Yes , we do . We like it very much .
__label__noemo	Ant Shirley , it's being years since we last met . How were you doing in the passing years ?
__label__noemo	I am certain I am going to fail my English test .
__label__noemo	Would you like to have a piece of cake ?
__label__joy	I can imagine .
__label__noemo	I will .
__label__joy	it's a letter from Ray and Sue in Shanghai !
__label__noemo	Maybe that's true for some positions , but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . They dress for success ! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . It's just not respectful to you client .
__label__noemo	How are you today ?
__label__noemo	That's right .
__label__noemo	Yeah , right here .
__label__noemo	Hi . I want to check out . My room is 1005 .
__label__noemo	I learned my lesson from the last experience . I didn't arrive early enough . So I ended up with a terrible seat , All the way up in the front row . It was one of my worst movie experiences ever .
__label__noemo	Did you lose any weight ?
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__noemo	Frans Smith ? I think you may have the wrong number .
__label__noemo	He'll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ?
__label__noemo	But you taught children , yes ?
__label__noemo	No , I haven't . I need help quick . It hurts really badly .
__label__noemo	Why ? In my opinion , it doesn't matter whether you won or not . The most important thing is participation .
__label__noemo	To tell you the truth , it was completely accidental .
__label__noemo	Surely it is .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . It's true that our products do cost slightly more than the other makers , but It's only due to our technological superiority .
__label__sadness	Oh ! Sorry to hear that . This is quite unusual as we have steak from the market every day .
__label__noemo	Not so well . I've come down with the flu .
__label__noemo	How about this one ? Downtown efficiency . Furnished ... What does furnished mean ?
__label__noemo	I just dropped in to say good-bye .
__label__noemo	Sure . Why don ’ t you sit down for a minute ? You haven ’ t taken a rest all morning .
__label__noemo	No , that's it .
__label__noemo	Well , sir . May I have your room number ?
__label__joy	No , not so soon . Couldn ’ t I persuade you to stay a couple of days more ?
__label__surprise	What was he doing ?
__label__noemo	So what can we do ?
__label__joy	Sound nice , I will try it .
__label__noemo	He was alone .
__label__noemo	Oh , I'm sorry . Let me go back to the cashier's to have it changed . ( a few minutes later , the waiter returns with the new bill . )
__label__noemo	How long have you known how to do that ?
__label__noemo	But I already tried my best .
__label__noemo	I will blow my nose sometime for you , and you'll see .
__label__noemo	Is there any extra income that you receive other than salary ?
__label__joy	And we could get a dog !
__label__noemo	Wow ! This sounds like something my wife would really enjoy ! Are there any outdoor activities we can take part in ?
__label__noemo	It's a two-way choice . And your application will be read .
__label__joy	Yes , I like collecting antiques .
__label__noemo	I felt OK until an hour or so ago , and then I just doubled over .
__label__noemo	May I have a pillow and blanket , PLS ?
__label__noemo	It is near the university . Five minutes ' walk from your flat , I think .
__label__noemo	Don't mention it , let's go in .
__label__surprise	You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ?
__label__noemo	How do I get the form to apply for unemployment benefits ?
__label__noemo	But how will I get to know the products ?
__label__noemo	Me too . I need something to read on the flight to new york . I can never sleep on planes . Sarah wants to pick up some children ’ s books for her daughter .
__label__noemo	What about the weather in Boston ?
__label__noemo	Well , why don't you ?
__label__noemo	I use a special dressing and homemade catsup .
__label__noemo	Yes . I have . I liked it very much . Like you , I was very impressed with Rachel ’ s performance in the movie . She ’ s going to be a star .
__label__noemo	It could . Modern humans actually have more flight or fight responses than our ancestors did . They just had a couple of close calls every day , but today , we have dozens or even hundreds !
__label__noemo	I see .
__label__noemo	Our advertisement says English competence is a key requirement of this position . Then how do you think of your proficiency in written and spoken English ?
__label__noemo	Of course I forgive you . What are friends for ? Now , what am I going to do for that other guy ?
__label__noemo	How long was she employed with your company ?
__label__noemo	Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ?
__label__noemo	She had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable . For example , the students had to treat each other with respect , or they would be disciplined .
__label__noemo	Wow . I'm getting rushed too , but just one . Are you thinking of joining any of them ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry , Sir , the full procedure can take up to 7 days to process everything .
__label__joy	All right , see you tonight .
__label__noemo	Overwork-amongst other things . You can't work 24 hours a day . You ' Ve got to slow down .
__label__noemo	You need to make one to come down and fill out your paperwork .
__label__noemo	There is a position I've had my eye on for several months now and I had good reason to believe that it was mine for the asking .
__label__noemo	It is ninety-five pounds per night . It is a double room with a bathroom . There is a fridge , coffee maker and a television in the room .
__label__joy	Paul , a company called me for an interview .
__label__noemo	No .
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift .
__label__noemo	fine . How ’ s your job going ?
__label__noemo	Why ? I think it ’ s convenient and good .
__label__noemo	Tell me where it happened and how .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t know how to vote .
__label__noemo	Talk to you later .
__label__noemo	Hello , May I speak to Mary , please ?
__label__joy	What a great idea !
__label__joy	No , thank you . That's it .
__label__anger	Look for it yourself , please ! Kinda busy here , Daniel !
__label__noemo	Well , only you liked it really , darling .
__label__noemo	No , France isn't very mountainous . But it does contain the Pyrenees , a large mountain range with high peaks and deep canyons . What kind of Climate does Japan have ?
__label__noemo	No . There's no call-out fee . It's included in the annual service contract .
__label__noemo	Could you do that ?
__label__surprise	You must be joking . You can't fall in love with someone you've never met !
__label__noemo	Get a transfer from the bus driver .
__label__surprise	Naughty ? I'm naughty ? I'm just clever . So I only do the things I am interested in .
__label__disgust	I dislike Susan . She is always above herself .
__label__noemo	It will be up shortly . Enjoy your food , sir .
__label__noemo	ID ? What's that ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I locked myself out . May I borrow a duplicate key for Room 201 ?
__label__noemo	It is on Spring Avenue .
__label__noemo	Then when will I get a reply at the latest ?
__label__noemo	You can get a boarding pass at that counter . Do you have anything to check in ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to have this cashed , please .
__label__joy	Ah ! That sounds interesting .
__label__noemo	Ladies and gentlemen , now we are in the National Forest Park .
__label__noemo	Your doctor will call you in a few days with the results .
__label__noemo	Can I see the paper when you're through , Sally ?
__label__noemo	Well . To be honest , that's not much use to me . I'll leave the country tomorrow . I'd really prefer a refund .
__label__noemo	thank you for reminding me . I'll continue to exercise as soon as I finish this project .
__label__noemo	What do you mean ?
__label__noemo	After the financial crisis , many industries are in incredibly cloudy situations . How do you think about our company ?
__label__noemo	Very good . If you enter this company , what department would you like to work in ?
__label__noemo	Very well , sir . Do you want me to trim your beard ?
__label__noemo	My goodness ! It ’ s the afternoon ? Doesn ’ t the time fly ! Do come in and sit down .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I started to learn English when I was in high school .
__label__noemo	Tell me your argument .
__label__joy	Thanks . It's rather cold this morning , wouldn't you say ?
__label__noemo	Wait a minute . There are some new terms for me . I can hardly follow you .
__label__noemo	John , it ’ s time to get up .
__label__noemo	Yes , and turn right at the Hilton Hotel .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll just have to wait for UCLA .
__label__noemo	Cookouts often start slowly . A two o ’ clock start means you arrive any time after two .
__label__noemo	But the freight cost will be higher and that will affect the retail price .
__label__noemo	I'd like some grapefruit juice , marmalade , two scrambled eggs with two sausages , toast , and a pot of black coffee , please . How long will it take ?
__label__noemo	I don ’ t know whether I am a Barbie Doll or you are one .
__label__noemo	The highest bungee spot in the world is located in Mount Kikicama , South Africa , which is 216 meters high . A cable car in a scenic spot in Switzerland is 160 meters high .
__label__noemo	Hi , I ’ m Susan Marshall , You can call me Susan.Nice to meet you .
__label__noemo	No-no-no , sorry ! That's a handicapped parking space . Are you handicapped ?
__label__noemo	He doesn't mind . As a matter of fact , he's very pleased .
__label__noemo	I should have some free time next week . Say , next Wednesday evening ?
__label__noemo	Right . I only knew a few English sentences .
__label__noemo	I think I could take better notes and read a little more .
__label__noemo	Once a week . Most nights I sit at home and watch telly
__label__noemo	Our employees receive fifteen days of paid vacation every year . If you don ’ t use the full fifteen days , they carry over to the following year .
__label__noemo	Actually you can have a window seat if you don't mind a ten-minute wait .
__label__noemo	Yes . It has been a long time since the last time we met .
__label__joy	Congratulations !
__label__noemo	I apologize . What day was this purchase made ?
__label__noemo	I'm so glad that the spring festival is near at hand .
__label__noemo	I would rather do the dishes than cook .
__label__joy	Hi , John ! I haven ’ t seen you for ages .
__label__noemo	Yes . I'd like to know how to use the library . You know , I'm a new student here .
__label__joy	Well , I'm glad you're starting to pay more attention to your diet .
__label__noemo	Well , we used to talk to each other before we were married . Remember ?
__label__noemo	I have my Tennis Club card . Is that good enough ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , you've got it . Do you want me to show you the way ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , I ’ Ve just moved here , and I ’ d like to activate my cell phone , and I ’ m not sure if I should go with a prepaid plan , or a monthly rate plan .
__label__noemo	Here is my phone number . If you need anyone to show you around , call me .
__label__noemo	Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don ’ t know man .
__label__noemo	Maurice Richard has the puck now , and passes it to the center . He shoots ! Wow what a save by the goalie !
__label__noemo	Yes . He's never said anything so I never told him . But now that he's getting older ...
__label__noemo	To be fair , though , both the costumes and scenery are marvelous .
__label__noemo	Can you repeat all that ? I think I'd better write it down .
__label__noemo	He said he hadn't taken any exams for ten years , and couldn't get used to it immediately . He was extremely nervous then .
__label__noemo	It's not for us .
__label__noemo	How big is it ?
__label__noemo	He lives nearby and he would just glance at the newspaper headlines , read the political sections and return them later .
__label__noemo	Yes . It is also called Dragon Boat Festival .
__label__noemo	That ’ s all right .
__label__noemo	I visited the Polar Aquarium today .
__label__noemo	Honey , could you help me here a minute ?
__label__noemo	I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available .
__label__noemo	Do you ?
__label__noemo	In that case , you need to turn on your airport .
__label__noemo	Till next Monday when we check out .
__label__noemo	We still offer a traditional retirement plan that pays out if you stay with the company for 5 years or more .
__label__noemo	Pretty good . I've made a few friends already .
__label__noemo	you can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her .
__label__noemo	Anything to drink ?
__label__anger	When I quarrel with my husband . He didn't even try to cool me out .
__label__noemo	Oh , no .
__label__noemo	That ’ s what my computer is showing .
__label__noemo	Please ask him to give me a call as soon as he return . he has my number .
__label__noemo	What are you doing ?
__label__noemo	I didn't do that .
__label__sadness	I see . Oh , wait . Ma'am , I'm sorry . These slacks were on sale .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	He used to be a policeman .
__label__noemo	Smiles and kind attitudes are the basics of acknowledgments .
__label__noemo	I have a relative working as a manager in your manufacturing department . Her name is Lilling . She told me a lot about your company and I became quite interested . I believe I can have a promising career with the development of this company .
__label__noemo	Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . It ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . Countries and companies just want the wood . They ’ re not thinking about the long-term damage to the forests . We should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life .
__label__noemo	Sure ! How about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches ?
__label__noemo	Please give him my regards . Poor Mien ! He didn't want to leave this house .
__label__noemo	Hello , may I speak to Mr . Robert the Human Resources Manager ?
__label__noemo	Yes , but I need the report copied on transparency paper .
__label__noemo	It is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway .
__label__noemo	Sellers aren ’ t really all that objective . They may have gotten used to a leaky faucet , but it is still broken .
__label__noemo	Which would you like to remit , by mail or by cable ?
__label__noemo	certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Ch
__label__joy	Do you want to go to an exhibition ? There is one at the Xinghai Exhibition Hall tomorrow .
__label__noemo	I have worked for IBM for three years .
__label__noemo	You know that I have had a series of miserable relationships . Last summer , I fell in love with John . But the romance blossomed for six or seven weeks , and then wilted .
__label__noemo	But don't you want to study music ? Shouldn't it be easy ?
__label__noemo	As soon as possible . Do you have a flight tomorrow ?
__label__joy	Oh , they look just like live cranes .
__label__noemo	I need to see your ID .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__joy	do you want to try some of my yogurt . It's a favorite everyday dessert in Greece .
__label__noemo	Is there any provision on applying for the patent for foreign company ?
__label__noemo	My baggage is missing !
__label__noemo	No , that's the price before tax . The tax rate is varies from different marketing areas , so it is difficult for us to figure in .
__label__noemo	Good.There are many different kind of language labs , but ours is a small one.If you decide to take the job , I'll explain how to operate the system , Are you sure ?
__label__noemo	yes , but I'd like to have a chance at job advancement .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , haven't we met somewhere before ?
__label__noemo	Okay , if you'll please fill out these forms ... ( She hands the forms to the customer . ) There's a minimum initial deposit of $ 100 for the checking account , and a minimum deposit of $ 500 for the savings account .
__label__noemo	And I've filed the letters .
__label__noemo	Would you recommend going there for a few days ?
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__noemo	Yes , some people even pack up his bed quilt and sleep there . That's a little bit crazy .
__label__noemo	I got it . Don't worry , just a common cold .
__label__noemo	What other expenses will we have ?
__label__noemo	Do you have anything made in the 1920s ?
__label__noemo	Do you think you have a chance ?
__label__noemo	The hours couldn't be better , 24/7 .
__label__noemo	Never mind , dear .
__label__noemo	Size 41 . I want something in dark flannel .
__label__noemo	45 Yuan . If you buy the two , you can get a small bottle of nail polish for free .
__label__surprise	A ETV ? Are you serious ? ETV ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me , what's the actual flying time from here to Zurich ?
__label__joy	Wow , there are so many lanterns to appreciate . Now , I can see why it's called the Lantern Festival . It deserves its name .
__label__noemo	It's a bit expensive . Can you tell me the schedule ?
__label__noemo	OK , thank you .
__label__noemo	Yes . Or you can bring it yourself .
__label__noemo	I just moved into my apartment , and the plumbing is not working .
__label__noemo	Can you lend me fifty bucks ?
__label__noemo	Sure . Which kind of gas do you want ?
__label__noemo	Mom , don't worry about me , I can do it .
__label__joy	Thank you , Steven . I accept your advice .
__label__joy	Thank you . I won ’ t miss it .
__label__noemo	No , it ’ s a dark brown suit .
__label__noemo	It goes all the way there .
__label__noemo	Well , the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him .
__label__noemo	There are various kinds of tea in China . It depends on the taste and effect .
__label__joy	You certainly deserve it . Let's celebrate !
__label__noemo	Why not ?
__label__noemo	I can't do that , Zina . You know I can't .
__label__joy	Good idea . Let's go . Where should we go ?
__label__noemo	What subjects did you like most at university ?
__label__noemo	They seemed impressed , and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . I ended up staying two years there actually . I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . I really enjoyed it there , and it really helped me build my skills .
__label__noemo	Wait a moment , mom .
__label__noemo	Ok , I will take two bottles .
__label__noemo	Let me see . I quoted your delivery in three months , didn't I ?
__label__noemo	I think that the public transport system could be made simpler . I never know where the bus routes actually go . The routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I see the same thing ; now we can do the math and check that , right ?
__label__joy	Right , congratulations .
__label__noemo	He must have just got online for the first time last week . He still thinks it's some kind of new toy .
__label__noemo	Would you tell me how I should send this parcel to Shanghai , China ? It contains only books .
__label__noemo	You'll have to make an appointment for that .
__label__noemo	I ’ m sure that the boy will become nobody when he grows up .
__label__noemo	My roommate always wants to play it . But I told her to buy her own game .
__label__noemo	That's convenient.Thank you .
__label__noemo	Let ’ s play a game !
__label__noemo	No , thank you
__label__noemo	let ’ s get a chunk of cheese too . Is that everything .
__label__noemo	Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home .
__label__joy	Our meal was absolutely perfect !
__label__noemo	I don't mind if you want to .
__label__joy	Oh , that's no problem .
__label__joy	Pretty good . There was a bit of turbulence while we were over the Pacific Ocean but it wasn't too bad . The worst thing was the guy behind me . He snored all through the night !
__label__noemo	I've got a sore throat , a runny nose and a headache .
__label__noemo	Yes . Actually my friend has a spare room in here apartment and she's looking for a flatmate . Would you like her phone number ?
__label__noemo	I see . Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
__label__noemo	Can I make personal phone calls during my office hours ?
__label__noemo	May I have your details , and I'll check for you .
__label__noemo	and what if it doesn't work out , right ?
__label__noemo	One screwdriver , coming right up . ( He mixes the drink . ) Here you are , sir .
__label__noemo	Yes , yes I did . Please come in ! I ’ m so glad you came ! This old house is falling apart ! Come on into the bathroom . See , here , there ’ s water leaking everywhere !
__label__noemo	Single or double ?
__label__noemo	Thanks . I don't suppose you have some paper , too .
__label__noemo	Our quoted price includes the software system , installation , 3 day training seminar and ongoing troubleshooting.There are no hidden costs .
__label__noemo	OK , here you are . The fitting room is behind the curtain .
__label__noemo	But where do I get a ticket ?
__label__noemo	I think you ’ re right about that . I ’ d need a good manager to be my spokesperson . I could do a lot of charity work , which would help a lot of people .
__label__noemo	I smoke around 30 each day .
__label__noemo	That sounds good . How much is one ?
__label__noemo	No ... that's not what I meant . I didn't mean that . She asked me where you were and I jokingly said that you were on a date with Sara . I thought Martha knew that you and Sara were just friends .
__label__noemo	Could you drop me off at the airport ?
__label__noemo	Because ... I heard John got married yesterday .
__label__joy	Well.The doctor said I have to remain here for at least two more days because I'm rather weak after childbirth .
__label__noemo	I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid you can't today .
__label__disgust	I found it very disappointing .
__label__anger	Mom ! I'll wear a helmet and I'll drive sane . I promise .
__label__noemo	What about the smaller components ?
__label__noemo	Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ?
__label__noemo	I am sure my friend can give you a ride .
__label__noemo	That ’ s fine .
__label__surprise	Is that so ? But I think It shouldn't keep you long in bed .
__label__noemo	I have been invited to teach Chinese at the University of Hawaii for two years .
__label__noemo	You've got everyone figured out , don't you ?
__label__noemo	I have no idea what to buy for Mary for her birthday .
__label__joy	It ’ s my pleasure .
__label__noemo	May I have a look at that vase , please ?
__label__noemo	you mean if they catch the murderer . I ’ m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .
__label__noemo	I want to open another account .
__label__noemo	Am I limited to a certain number of copies ?
__label__noemo	I never eat breakfast though .
__label__noemo	Oh , okay . Well , here you go .
__label__noemo	Would you care for some lemon for your tea ?
__label__noemo	What you would like me to do about it ?
__label__noemo	I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ?
__label__noemo	Yes , certainly .
__label__noemo	$ 40 per night .
__label__noemo	Oh , did you get a job ?
__label__noemo	You would fit both of them in your bedroom . Perhaps you could also get the dressing table . I think that one would look good in your bedroom .
__label__joy	You flatter me .
__label__noemo	Please fill out the form sir .
__label__noemo	I certainly can't afford it , but I'm sure I could find some good student loans .
__label__anger	Fine ! I am going to go home and drop off this nightstand , coffee table and love seat while you look for the rest of the things .
__label__noemo	Hi , I need to transfer some money to another account . It ’ s urgent .
__label__noemo	Oh , it seems there is nothing that evening .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t know much about him . He died when I was just a baby . Even though I don ’ t have a blood relationship with my step-father and step-brother , I consider them to be my real family .
__label__joy	It was nothing .
__label__joy	I'm a great cook actually . You will see .
__label__noemo	How about Monday morning at 9 a . m . ?
__label__noemo	Have you got any specific proposal about the terms of payment ?
__label__noemo	I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight .
__label__joy	Thanks your flatter .
__label__noemo	First , as far as I know , your company has had an impressive growth record.Second , I want to get into the foreign trade business .
__label__noemo	Hmm . I ’ m pretty booked up this week . Let ’ s move it up to next week .
__label__noemo	Yes , I have . I need them to help me with these new dished I ’ m trying to make . I need a little more practice before I invite guests over .
__label__noemo	I help out at the children ’ s hospital . I help plan activities .
__label__surprise	That's amazing .
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . I will tell my wife . Thank you for telling me so much .
__label__noemo	Of course I did . As recognition for a job well done . Once a month I invite the most productive employee to dinner .
__label__noemo	So what would your role in the company ?
__label__noemo	I see .
__label__noemo	Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it .
__label__noemo	Good morning .
__label__noemo	I was doing quite well at college . I completed my MBA degree in international trade with first-class honors .
__label__noemo	Where should I go after I arrived at the university ?
__label__joy	No , not at all . It looks really classy on you . Where did you pick that up ?
__label__noemo	If you can , could you pick up my prescription for me ?
__label__sadness	I'm sorry .
__label__joy	Oh , this one looks really good . And look at the garden . So beautiful .
__label__noemo	You're supposed to always have a hearty breakfast .
__label__noemo	no , I was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . How about you ?
__label__noemo	OK . I will be there .
__label__noemo	Just a second . I'll go get some .
__label__noemo	That's impossible . I remember the number clearly . Isn't this 763-4565 ?
__label__joy	I'm glad to know that you like her .
__label__noemo	No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go .
__label__noemo	OK . What does it sell ?
__label__noemo	I can't agree on that . Just cut it out . Give him a break and don't spoil the day .
__label__joy	My pleasure .
__label__noemo	Next time you come back , bring your ID .
__label__noemo	Thank you and goodbye .
__label__noemo	Good morning , I have an appointment with Mr . Wang Li .
__label__noemo	Yes , I do .
__label__noemo	I'm coming for the job you've advertised in yesterday's newspaper .
__label__noemo	That's it . How much ?
__label__noemo	What course did you like best ?
__label__noemo	Hello , there . How can I help ?
__label__noemo	I do wish your christmas and happy new year .
__label__noemo	you might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size than I am now !
__label__noemo	I want to work in the banking industry . I ’ Ve always been interesting in working for an international invest bank . I ’ d like to help people invest their money .
__label__joy	Yes , of course , Ms Chan .
__label__joy	Come over and visit when you have time .
__label__noemo	Is that Room service ?
__label__joy	So soon . It seems as if you just got here .
__label__noemo	0kay . Dinner's on me .
__label__joy	Hah , hah ! See ? I guessed right . You weren't watching the road at all .
__label__noemo	Go along this street to the traffic lights .
__label__noemo	I've been trying to call you all day .
__label__noemo	Do you think that I should get a new wardrobe ?
__label__joy	Well , well , Mike.Fancy meeting you here .
__label__noemo	Let's go to the cinema tonight , shall we ?
__label__noemo	What about a draft at 120 days sight ?
__label__noemo	Mike , I don't think that it's a good idea to go out again . I really need to focus on getting packed and ready to move back home .
__label__noemo	That's all . Have a nice stay here .
__label__noemo	No , it ’ s my sister .
__label__joy	Thanks so much . You're a good teacher .
__label__noemo	You're hundred percent sure you want to eat here ?
__label__noemo	I'm out of work at the moment .
__label__noemo	Not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu .
__label__noemo	Great party , isn't it ?
__label__anger	Freeze ! Police ! Put your hands over your head !
__label__noemo	One dessert will serve two , so would you like to split a second one ?
__label__noemo	Sure , I have . Will you join ?
__label__noemo	What classes did you have ?
__label__noemo	I'm afraid I can't . Parking is not allowed here .
__label__noemo	Do we have to pay extra charge for that ?
__label__noemo	Gotcha .
__label__noemo	Is your application successful ?
__label__noemo	I will call you when I find it .
__label__joy	It sounds nice . We can't wait to visiting the factory .
__label__noemo	I won't be long . No more than ten minutes . Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park ?
__label__noemo	Sounds great ! How many kinds of folk collections they have ?
__label__joy	Happy Birthday ! This is for you , Kate !
__label__noemo	Fishing . It's great fun .
__label__noemo	Are you ready ?
__label__noemo	Yes , my friend and I just had breakfast at the dining room , but we didn't use any services .
__label__joy	He has a really good voice !
__label__noemo	Here are the leads from last week's exhibit as a trade show . There are about forty or so that are hot . You should contact them immediately , in the next twenty-four hours if you can . The rest are categorized according to potential and interest.You can see we've got our hot stack , our warm stack , our lukewarm , and our cold but not dead stack .
__label__noemo	Just a moment , please . I'll check for you .
__label__noemo	Holly , I just heard some terrible news .
__label__noemo	Let me see . Look ! You confused the video frequency with the audio frequency .
__label__noemo	Yes , I think that's it . Can I get that on the Accord ?
__label__surprise	Really ? I ’ m not sure that I would like all the attention . There have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star ’ s private live in recent years .
__label__joy	I think I got lucky in choosing a wine that blends with this meal .
__label__noemo	OK , but they better tag lightly !
__label__noemo	I didn ’ t , but I applied for an apprenticeship , and since I studied math , AND I have a good attitude , my application was accepted .
__label__joy	Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow here ?
__label__noemo	Very well . And my favorite subject is Chinese .
__label__noemo	I guess I'm a bit old-fashioned . I'd rather have my parents live with me than live in a retirement room .
__label__noemo	Did you play network games the whole night ?
__label__noemo	I can't stand American Idol ! I think it's really over-rated .
__label__noemo	Nothing special .
__label__noemo	The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM .
__label__noemo	But I prefer burnt bread .
__label__noemo	Not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back .
__label__joy	Have you started planning your christmas vacation yet ?
__label__noemo	Fine . Here you go .
__label__noemo	What do you do in your spare times ?
__label__noemo	I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution .
__label__noemo	Well ... ? Have you thought of it yet ?
__label__noemo	OK . Don't forget to get your ticket three days ahead .
__label__noemo	We're in big trouble , Jason . Nick is beating us by a long shot .
__label__noemo	Really ? Do you often shop online ?
__label__noemo	You can't write with one hand and draw with the other .
__label__joy	This is the specialty of our restaurant , sir .
__label__noemo	If you'll just fill out this form , please .
__label__noemo	I'll remember to do that .
__label__noemo	Yes , it is not easy .
__label__noemo	I ’ d have one guest bathroom in the basement , one attached to the main bedroom , and one upstairs , so a total of three .
__label__noemo	really ? Maybe I shall also sign up for its membership .
__label__noemo	No problem . Good luck .
__label__noemo	How do I contact them ?
__label__surprise	Oh . Thanks a million .
__label__noemo	It keeps running all the time , never stopping . And it makes a strange sound . All the ice cream inside it melted .
__label__joy	Awesome , we went to Australia and New Zealand .
__label__noemo	Do you know where your classes are ?
__label__noemo	How may I help you ?
__label__noemo	Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .
__label__noemo	Good day . Is this the Business Centre ?
__label__noemo	The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it .
__label__noemo	I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .
__label__noemo	David , I heard you lost your job .
__label__noemo	You ’ re free to go .
__label__joy	Yes , that'd be all right .
__label__noemo	I think so . But can I try another one ? I don't like the color .
__label__noemo	What about your company's QC management ?
__label__noemo	So you're really planning to quit invoking and switch over to WebTracker ?
__label__noemo	Please don't be nosey .
__label__noemo	Good morning . Phyllis Seymour speaking .
__label__joy	How long have you been working there ?
__label__noemo	Can you tell me how to apply for a job on the Internet ?
__label__noemo	It means ' telegraphic transfer ' . So , if you use this way it's fast and secure and can be done from anywhere , to anywhere in the world .
__label__noemo	I should admit that sometimes I care too much about the details . I am always in pursuit of perfection .
__label__noemo	There is a tornado warning on . My mother just told me she heard it on the radio .
__label__noemo	Can you describe your health concern ?
__label__noemo	Your lease isn ’ t up yet .
__label__noemo	Yes , right now it's the busy season .
__label__noemo	He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
__label__noemo	No , you don't . We use computers now .
__label__noemo	Listen , I'd better get back to the grindstone .
__label__noemo	Why don't you try an Americano ? Espresso with water .
__label__noemo	Is there anything else , sir ?
__label__joy	Thanks to your help.To our friendship .
__label__noemo	But your brochure said that this was a package deal and the hotel ’ s services were all-inclusive .
__label__noemo	Office romance is very tricky .
__label__joy	yes , do you like it ?
__label__noemo	That doesn't surprise me .
__label__noemo	To encourage the staff increases .
__label__noemo	There is a coffee shop round the corner . Can you see that big building at the end of the road ?
__label__noemo	The ad says $ 325 plus deposit .
__label__noemo	I thought we were supposed to meet here .
__label__noemo	Can you please speed up ? I am catching the train .
__label__noemo	I study every night .
__label__noemo	He was really influenced by the way they do things on the west coast . I guess the working atmosphere is a lot more relaxed and casual in California . It comes from the information technology industry .. there isn't such a large division between home and office , so people want to work in the clothes they feel more relaxed in .
__label__noemo	How would you like to make the payment ?
__label__noemo	Ok , that's all .
__label__noemo	Hi . Fill it up please . Premium .
__label__noemo	I wonder if the municipal government will take some preventive measures .
__label__noemo	It'll take us all some time to get used to the change .
__label__noemo	Yes we are going towards Westminster Abbey . I can see it now ! Look to your right .
__label__noemo	Thank you . I've booked two rooms for Ms White and Mr Webber from Wednesday the 25th to Saturday the 28th of September .
__label__surprise	Are you sure ?
__label__disgust	What ’ s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ’ t people do something to stop it ?
__label__noemo	How are you going to catch up ?
__label__noemo	Where would you like to be in 5 years ?
__label__noemo	I see how that can get a bit annoying .
__label__noemo	What about coming back ? I'd like to come back about 7 p . m .
__label__joy	You flatter me .
__label__noemo	The price factor can be a useful instrument for exporters when trying to place their products in industrialized countries . Of course , marketing goods abroad is not only a question of price . There are also other important factors such as design , quality of goods , terms of sale , transport and insurance .
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	One more question . It looks like some of these numbers are long-distance . Do you have a calling card that I can use to get through to them ?
__label__noemo	I know , Grandma , I just ...
__label__joy	Hi , Linda . I haven't seen you for ages .
__label__noemo	Oh yes-five days a week . You have to visit customers all over the territory .
__label__noemo	Let me think . About half past seven if it is okay for you .
__label__noemo	Do you have much experience with kids ?
__label__noemo	What did David do yesterday ? Did he and Judy go dancing ?
__label__noemo	But we still need to go back to it . Don't overdo it .
__label__noemo	If a client complains about the service of your department , what will you do ?
__label__noemo	You've got to be joking ! It's the teacher's right to say anything wants , and if she saw Myra cheating , she certainly had the right to say so .
__label__noemo	Well , he isn't a lawyer , so I don't think he needs to have a briefcase like that .
__label__noemo	I ’ m interested in teaching at your school .
__label__noemo	What is wrong with you ?
__label__noemo	Minus the fee . Here are your dollars . Please sign here .
__label__noemo	You know how to draw and paint ?
__label__joy	If have time , I'll come again .
__label__noemo	You are right . Did you say 5:30 ? I'll make a note of it . Fine .
__label__noemo	Sure . Have you checked the weather report ?
__label__noemo	Yes . Are you ?
__label__joy	Why not ?
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__noemo	Would you please tell us how to review our lessons ?
__label__joy	Sure . Speaking of photos , what type of film will be the best ? You know , I'm planning a tour to Jiuzhaigou Valley .
__label__noemo	The Engineering Manager and his team will interview the candidates . HR will also be involved with the interview , but basically arranging the schedule and explaining the benefits .
__label__noemo	Okay , let me know when you're ready to order your food .
__label__joy	Yes , stay in touch . Bye !
__label__noemo	Yes . Is it easy to get around ?
__label__noemo	Our office is over on Green Street , just west of the college .
__label__noemo	I'll go and quit my job in the ABC Company .
__label__noemo	Mary said she couldn't put up with Tom , for he fell in love with another woman .
__label__noemo	You mean I've got to lose weight ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I did . But nobody has handed it in as yet .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	I am sorry to say this , sir , but you should've been more careful .
__label__noemo	I'd better not . Please don't tempt me . Please !
__label__noemo	Help the patient bathe and change his clothes , nurse . Then bring him into the operating room .
__label__joy	Very good .
__label__noemo	Steven , have you ever met Hanson ever since he went back to London ?
__label__noemo	Sign here , PLS . You can appeal to the court within 14 days . This slip has all the information you need . Pls drive safely , sir .
__label__noemo	I know what you mean .
__label__noemo	They are attending an international conference here .
__label__noemo	I am looking for a job myself . What were you thinking of doing next ?
__label__noemo	Let me see , Mr . Lee.right ? How would like to pay your bill ?
__label__noemo	I don't know what to say . This can't be happening . Here's the obituary .
__label__noemo	Is your back door higher than the ground level ?
__label__noemo	Sorry , sir .
__label__noemo	Then give me the ordinary ones .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__noemo	Is there anything else wrong with it ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights .
__label__noemo	I think so . I ’ Ve got the shopping list , so let ’ s go .
__label__noemo	Don't worry . I will find someone to assist you .
__label__noemo	I heard that she's one of the wealthiest women in the world .
__label__noemo	Oh , let me guess . Through the internet ?
__label__joy	Cool ! The sound is great . These earphones are awesome !
__label__noemo	I don't think so . I think it's about your attitude towards learning . One should be open to new ideas , decisions , skills or behaviors .
__label__noemo	Well , I don ’ t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , could I ask a favour ?
__label__noemo	I am looking for a job that is more advanced than that , such as sales manager or regional manager .
__label__noemo	Honey ? Have you seen our soup bowls ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to . How do you like the hat ?
__label__joy	Can I have a look as well ?
__label__noemo	Are there any disadvantages about it ?
__label__noemo	I understand . Why would you like to join our company ?
__label__noemo	Every morning you get up late and rush off to work late .
__label__noemo	I haven ’ t decided yet . But I may go out .
__label__noemo	Are you sure these are the only open classes ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s right . I ’ Ve never really liked it since I got here .
__label__noemo	Do you offer a course in business management ?
__label__noemo	Black .
__label__noemo	But how much discount can I get if I use it to buy goods next time ?
__label__noemo	It sure did . It was a heavy storm , with lots of thunder .
__label__noemo	I did not sleep much last night . I really feel bad . It was a crazy night .
__label__noemo	No , not that much . Now , yes , that's fine .
__label__noemo	Here , take my credit card .
__label__noemo	Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home .
__label__noemo	Yes , I will .
__label__noemo	Sure . At least if I do get robbed , heaven forbid , I can get my money back using the traveller's cheques insurance . Once , when I was travelling in France , I was pick-pocketed and not only did you replace my Traveller's Cheques for free , you also did it extremely quickly and easily .
__label__noemo	I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ...
__label__noemo	What about the twill ? It washes well and won't lose shape .
__label__noemo	Is this the information here ? Well , let's take a look then ...
__label__noemo	I have done it . But now I have an urgent appointment to keep . Could you drive me to the subway station ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play .
__label__noemo	Let me just make sure . You want to withdraw one thousand dollars .
__label__noemo	No , thanks . A taxi is just fine .
__label__noemo	The pay must be good .
__label__noemo	I would much rather see her once or twice and not do anything about it — — what could I about it anyway ?
__label__noemo	I see .
__label__noemo	They come in packages of ten or twenty .
__label__noemo	You have to deal with a lot of pressure from your parents .
__label__noemo	We could start with Hydrochlorothiazide , which is a diuretic .
__label__joy	All right . I'll bring your soup right away .
__label__noemo	My hands are full . Can ’ t you see that ?
__label__noemo	we could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .
__label__noemo	Actually , I have a suggestion for you . We've started a new service called Entrusting Deposit Combination - Have you heard about this ?
__label__noemo	I must meet someone at the airport tomorrow afternoon .
__label__noemo	You're made a good choice . This china tea set is unusual .
__label__noemo	I still have a question to ask you .
__label__noemo	But don't forget to give me a ring .
__label__joy	Excellent ! That sounds like a plan .
__label__joy	You're finally here ! What took so long ?
__label__noemo	I told you to get this consignment out last week.We can't very well run a light bulb conference without any light bulbs , can we ? What am I going to do with you ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me , can you tell me where I can go fishing ?
__label__joy	You know what , I've just got a new job with a computer company .
__label__noemo	Usually people with high blood pressure have no symptoms , so we call it the silent killer .
__label__noemo	I believe you ordered the Grand Slam breakfast .
__label__joy	I can plug it into a folding keyboard to type in message mode . I can even surf the net .
__label__noemo	How do you celebrate it ?
__label__noemo	Would you check the engine , please ? It is knocking .
__label__noemo	Hello , Steven . Can you do me a favor ?
__label__noemo	No , that ’ s all right . Paula . Why don ’ t you get something to eat , and I ’ ll see you this afternoon .
__label__noemo	The northern line is what you want .
__label__surprise	No way !
__label__noemo	I am worrying about my husband .
__label__surprise	You did ? But I tried to call you at least twenty times and nobody answered .
__label__noemo	Fortunately for you , you don't . Next time , if you have any questions about visas , you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
__label__noemo	Will the object fit into this size of box ?
__label__noemo	But Ernie , we're still missing something . We need someone to play the music !
__label__noemo	Can you tell me the time ?
__label__noemo	I'll see you then .
__label__noemo	What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . I play the part of the detective . He has to catch the killer , but there ’ s very little evidence . It ’ s a psychological thriller with some frightening scenes , but I hope audience won ’ t be too scared to go to the movie theatres !
__label__joy	That's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ?
__label__joy	Very well , Go ahead .
__label__noemo	We will visit the Statue of Liberty as scheduled .
__label__joy	That's great . We should visit him some time .
__label__noemo	Do you have an extra battery ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__surprise	Frightened ? You must be joking !
__label__noemo	The total will be $ 32.42 . Will that be cash ?
__label__noemo	I am sorry , sir . Can you tell me your room number ?
__label__noemo	OK , that's all . We'll inform you in two days .
__label__noemo	May I have two full fare tickets and one half ticket ?
__label__noemo	it ’ s definitely my mother . And , her mother is definitely the matriarch of the bigger family .
__label__joy	Oh , they look nice . May I try that black one on ?
__label__joy	For the 100th anniversary of the opening of the library we are going to have a party .
__label__noemo	I think so . I feel very hot .
__label__noemo	Shall we check your oil and tires ?
__label__noemo	Are you ready ?
__label__joy	Hi , I'm Lucas , I just moved in next door .
__label__joy	I've been away on a vacation .
__label__noemo	Gee ! You scared me !
__label__noemo	Then you'll have to take a bus and get off at the Central Railway Station .
__label__noemo	I don't know . Do you like snowing ?
__label__noemo	We need to figure out how much money we ’ re spending and what we ’ re spending it on .
__label__noemo	But , ladies , the room ’ s not yet ready . It will be delay about half an hour . Perhaps you can fill the registration form first . And rest at the lobby for a while . We ’ ll let you know when the room ‘ s ready .
__label__noemo	Not much . But there is a lot of traffic . I can't stand the noise sometimes ! Where do you live ?
__label__anger	I've had it with Tim ! I think I'm going to quit !
__label__noemo	Yes.Which kind of salad dressing would you prefer ?
__label__noemo	Should I ask Sara to the party ?
__label__noemo	Would you please recommend a diamond for me ?
__label__noemo	No , tell him I'm tied up .
__label__noemo	We could take out some advertisements to local newspapers . I checked the prices and they are reasonable .
__label__noemo	It really isn't hard , sir . You just have to follow the instructions .
__label__joy	No problem ! Now for your pants , let me just measure your waist and the inseam .
__label__noemo	Could you take us to the Fifth Avenue ?
__label__noemo	What about the performance itself ?
__label__joy	so are you enjoying your new job ?
__label__noemo	Got it . I'll call you later tonight and we can talk about what to do on Saturday .
__label__noemo	There isn't such a code ?
__label__joy	Cool . You must have been to a lot of places .
__label__noemo	I've got some documents here that go with the L / C our company opened 10 days ago . I think there is something wrong .
__label__anger	You're going to mop the floor until you can see your face in it !
__label__noemo	Yes , my house is far away from here . May I ask for an apartment ?
__label__noemo	Yes . Such people don ’ t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs .
__label__noemo	Do you know Sally ?
__label__noemo	Anything else ?
__label__noemo	May I help you , ma'ma ?
__label__noemo	You know , today I asked a student if he brought his dictionary with him . It ’ s a rule I made for the class that everyone brings a bilingual dictionary with them because sometimes they don ’ t understand me . The funniest thing is that this student gave me a lot of reasons and no direct answer .
__label__noemo	I have to miss school next week .
__label__sadness	I just lost my job . My boss just told me .
__label__noemo	I saw that in the guide.It looks like they have different restaurants and different kinds of architecture.Do you want to go ?
__label__noemo	What was that again ?
__label__noemo	Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance .
__label__noemo	It depends . If they are not busy , they will come to join us , and talk with us .
__label__noemo	All right . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	I am sorry about the quality problem , but I propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee .
__label__anger	yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced . I could have talked my way to thirty .
__label__joy	Yes , please .
__label__noemo	Yes , I do .
__label__noemo	No , I'm afraid that isn't possible . You must wait until maturity before you cash them .
__label__noemo	Take it from my checking account .
__label__surprise	You haven't ? If you've never tried it I can show you how .
__label__noemo	City Bank . This is Tom . May I help you ?
__label__noemo	"Don't forget to say "" Thank you "" when you take a seat ."
__label__noemo	What time are you leaving ?
__label__surprise	Why ? Are you kidding me ? A guy like that is hard to find . Few boys are so caring , so patient , and did I mention he is hottie ?
__label__noemo	Not that I can think of . Wait a second , we ’ re out of breakfast cereal . I think corn flakes are on sale . Get those .
__label__joy	Yes , you ’ re right . Good night .
__label__noemo	It's not that far . Do you see that Yellow building over there ?
__label__noemo	BMW 530 .
__label__noemo	Please tell me something about your insurance background .
__label__noemo	You will receive the tender notice next month and you'll find the information .
__label__noemo	Certainly . Where are you now ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry to say that we have to let you go , John .
__label__joy	Yes , I am , and I am so excited .
__label__noemo	How was the movie last night ?
__label__noemo	Carrie , are you ok ? You seem a bit down .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'd like to insure it for 20 dollars . How much shall I pay altogether ?
__label__noemo	Did you make us get off early ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s unless there is a traffic jam . It could take three hours .
__label__noemo	What can I do for you today ?
__label__noemo	that must have been horrible . Did you go out at all that day to see what was going on ?
__label__noemo	OK , Devon , I've been putting on a few pounds and you're quite a lean fit guy .
__label__noemo	Impossible ! Well , I'm not giving up yet . It's not over till the fat lady sings !
__label__surprise	Another note ? But how ? I didn't see anyone !
__label__noemo	Yes , hope you like it . Do you need beer or wine ?
__label__noemo	Have you ever shopped at Whole Foods market ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to go to Tianjin .
__label__noemo	Why ? If I eat less , then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves , right ?
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__noemo	I ’ d rather you typed it .
__label__noemo	Do I need to pay anything ? Like a handling fee , or something ?
__label__surprise	Really ? Congratulations .
__label__noemo	Did you have a layover ?
__label__noemo	I'm seeing a show at Rockefeller Center .
__label__sadness	What a pity !
__label__noemo	Have a good time !
__label__noemo	What would you like to eat ?
__label__noemo	How much altogether ?
__label__noemo	Yes , on a business trip . How about Yuu ?
__label__noemo	Actually , I'd forgotten about it .
__label__noemo	Would you like to have them altered ? Or would you like a different size ?
__label__noemo	So I can say now that you must have enjoyed the opera . Which scene is your favorite ?
__label__noemo	Bye .
__label__joy	I don't know about that , but my door is always open . Stop by anytime .
__label__joy	You got it ! I ’ m going to spend two fabulous weeks in Hawaii !
__label__noemo	No problem . I need some markers , some color pencils , a pair of scissors , some highlighter , rulers ..
__label__joy	It sounds like a special quilt . Why do you want to sell it ?
__label__noemo	Which train do you like ?
__label__joy	My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer , and I suppose you dance often .
__label__surprise	You're kidding !
__label__noemo	No , we ’ re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
__label__noemo	Good . I recommend it . Shakespeare is of course enormously important.We want our students to take the class as soon as they can.And Professor Friedman is an excellent teacher .
__label__noemo	I've got to catch the last bus . See you later .
__label__noemo	Can you tell me why you want to buy it ?
__label__noemo	Have you finished your work ?
__label__noemo	I don't know . It looks a little wrong down .
__label__noemo	No . If you can't break it , keep the change . But can you give me a receipt ?
__label__joy	My pleasure .
__label__noemo	I'm colin . It's nice to meet you . What do you do ?
__label__joy	Okay , it sounds good .
__label__noemo	Are you serious ? How can that be ?
__label__noemo	That sucks . He must feel depressed .
__label__noemo	No , often my boss requires overtime work .
__label__noemo	After that , we'll let you decide if you still want a murder , I mean motorcycle .
__label__noemo	Can I use the clippers ?
__label__noemo	What kind of personality do you think you have ?
__label__noemo	It feels a little tight around the waist . Do you have a bigger one ?
__label__joy	Hey , the same to you !
__label__noemo	Not always . I don't always like the person I'm on the date with .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry , but we usually don't do it . It is our policy .
__label__noemo	No , I wish I was ! I just got back from Spain actually .
__label__noemo	What do you mean ?
__label__noemo	They're three hundred dollars .
__label__noemo	No , I have been pretty healthy . I just have trouble taking a really deep breath .
__label__noemo	So how can you stand the heat ?
__label__noemo	Do you have an English-Chinese dictionary ?
__label__noemo	Last time I lent you money , you never paid me back .
__label__noemo	I had nothing to do with the crime that was committed .
__label__noemo	Would you tell me the general description of your present job ?
__label__noemo	Is that hard to get a passport ?
__label__noemo	His name is Lin , L - I - N .
__label__noemo	Actually , it could have been better .
__label__noemo	Would you like to see our new shirts ?
__label__noemo	Yes , what's worse is he can't take any further part in the game .
__label__noemo	She will be back soon.You can wait and see .
__label__noemo	I guess I never thought of that before .
__label__noemo	Come on . You're great at teaching and I know you will love him . He's adorable !
__label__joy	I will have fun .
__label__noemo	No problem . Just take your clothes off from the waist up and put the gown on , with the opening in the back .
__label__noemo	You mean the white building near the playground ?
__label__joy	Are you really ?
__label__surprise	Are you crazy ? You have no idea what you are talking about ! Just for my eyes I have to get eye-liner , an eyelash curler , eye shadow , an eyebrow pencil and mascara . Then I need to get foundation , liq
__label__joy	I think that's the idea I was looking for . Thanks , man .
__label__noemo	you can find out from their friends .
__label__joy	All right ! Thanks !
__label__noemo	I wish you luck .
__label__noemo	It starts at 8 o'clock .
__label__noemo	I thought leather shoes will do just as well .
__label__noemo	Is that all there is to it ?
__label__noemo	That's not the same thing . If you buy hotel souvenirs , they have no sentimental value .
__label__noemo	Did she buy them here ?
__label__joy	I am sure I'll enjoy some real chinese food then .
__label__noemo	No , Lucy . Don't get me wrong . I mean school will be open on Sept . 2nd , and I will have a very tight schedule by then .
__label__joy	Well , uh , I'll let you decide that for yourself . He'll be here a little later . Here's our room !
__label__noemo	I didn ’ t know you were a twin ! Are you identical or fraternal ?
__label__noemo	I really did , but what ’ s so great about it is that it ’ s really affordable .
__label__noemo	Yes , I almost slid too.Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ?
__label__noemo	Hello , I would like to speak with Ryan .
__label__noemo	Janice , do you still remember how our filing system works ?
__label__noemo	well , okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael .
__label__noemo	I think our son was trying to pull a fast one on us .
__label__noemo	sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ?
__label__noemo	Oh , In what way .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry to say that this room service charge is yours .
__label__noemo	There are clubs for beginners . It's cheaper to buy those rather than rent them a few times .
__label__noemo	But your health is more important . Believe me !
__label__noemo	What a large building . Can we visit by ourselves ?
__label__noemo	That man just made history .
__label__noemo	Where are you studying and what's your major ?
__label__noemo	Yes , can I see a few T-shirts , Please ?
__label__noemo	Speaking .
__label__noemo	Have you moved into your new house yet , Michael ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me ! Does this bus go to the railway station ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . In their culture women should put family first .
__label__noemo	Tell the man behind the counter what you want .
__label__joy	Don't be silly , forget about it .
__label__noemo	Certainly . We can arrange the structure to suit whatever you require . That's why this service is so popular ; it's suitable for everyone because we make it that way .
__label__noemo	You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . You have the right to have an attorney present during questioning . If you cannot afford an attorney , one will be appointed for you.Do you understand ?
__label__noemo	Maybe . But that's not kept the new boss from breathing down my neck . To be honest , I've got a better offer from another company .
__label__noemo	Is there a problem with your account ?
__label__noemo	Give me a shot of whisky and soda .
__label__noemo	You can take 100 cigarettes and 2 bottles of wine with you free of charge .
__label__noemo	you should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise .
__label__noemo	Yes , I will be there on time .
__label__joy	This is one of my favorite items .
__label__sadness	Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ’ d only hurt you , I know I ’ d only make you cry .
__label__noemo	I got one the other day .
__label__noemo	I drive a motorcycle .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll give you a call around 6:00 and stop by around 6:30 .
__label__joy	well , let me know when you can get it fixed . I ’ d love to go for a ride in it !
__label__noemo	On what days are the classes ?
__label__noemo	Can you fill it ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to exchange 5000 Singapore dollars into the US dollars please .
__label__noemo	Well , from experience we can predict the lifespan of different components . We try to replace components before they fail or wear out . This prevents the equipment from breaking down . It also saves us a lot of trouble !
__label__noemo	Yeah , but we still need RIB 500,000 . Maybe we can use some of our savings to pay part of it .
__label__noemo	Jill , how do you like your new job ?
__label__noemo	Don't worry about it.Your sister lives there . She probably knows the places in town you shouldn't go.It ' s true there are some dangerous places in big American cities.But if your sister lives there , she must know the city pretty well already .
__label__surprise	What an agile child !
__label__noemo	Are you sure ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry . I know it must have come as a great shock .
__label__noemo	Yes . I need some ice water delivered .
__label__noemo	Ok . I ’ ll let you know when I ’ Ve sorted out my clothes .
__label__noemo	Go to Gate 56 , the plane is now boarding , you must hurry .
__label__joy	He's a very creative painter . His paintings sell well .
__label__noemo	The total for all these items comes to $ 36.78 .
__label__noemo	I was going to go here first , but my grades weren ’ t good enough .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	Because we're partners .
__label__noemo	Anything to drink ?
__label__noemo	Are you finished ?
__label__noemo	I ’ ll let you know when I get the book in .
__label__noemo	When the result comes out , I will tell you about it . Remember , never be afraid or be too tired .
__label__noemo	OK . Here you are .
__label__noemo	for our errands , and maybe a little extra for something from a vendor on the street .
__label__noemo	That is just an excuse . You can always find some time to exercise .
__label__noemo	One last thing , I ’ Ve decided to come out of the closet .
__label__noemo	Sure . Your cash back is $ 13 . And we'll bring out your fries in two minutes .
__label__noemo	What size do you wear ? These shoes are on sale .
__label__noemo	congratulations ! I had no idea .
__label__noemo	Yes , please .
__label__noemo	Oh , I'm sorry to hear that , sir.What exactly is problem ?
__label__joy	Here is your receipt.Thank you .
__label__noemo	How are your stocks doing , Jim ?
__label__noemo	Thank you . How much is it ?
__label__anger	You ’ re unbearable ; you can walk home , I ’ m leaving .
__label__noemo	Oh , what a relief ! Thank you very much for your help , Miss .
__label__noemo	That's more convenient .
__label__noemo	No , everthing.Those things for sure , but also labor problems , raw materials , new subcontractors , mergers , in short , anything and everything.So I can make a fully informed decision .
__label__joy	It's late.It ' s high time I left.Thank you for a most wonderful evening .
__label__noemo	Hello . I need to find out if a Receipt of Proceeds has arrived . I'm from Felix Wasserman Associates .
__label__noemo	I'd like a refund on this sweater .
__label__noemo	No . It's not far at all .
__label__noemo	That's OK . A month is enough for you to learn the basic movements . It would be great to have you with us on the show .
__label__noemo	Is there a penalty for having an overdraft ?
__label__joy	It's my pleasure .
__label__noemo	Anne Hathaway is in a new movie called Becoming Jane which is based on a true story about Jane Austen .
__label__noemo	I didn't think there would be a problem .
__label__surprise	Really ? Quite a woman , isn ’ t she ?
__label__noemo	No way , mom . I don't like piano .
__label__noemo	Sit down , please . What's wrong with you ?
__label__noemo	I like one with flowers on its brim .
__label__noemo	OK . Can I serve you anything else ?
__label__noemo	This is a sizable sum . Is there any reason you are closing your account with us Mr . Lee ?
__label__noemo	some of my friends play cards on the internet . Have you ever tried that ?
__label__noemo	So , we could use it to pay for my son's living expenses , not just his tuition ?
__label__noemo	College job placement services can help .
__label__noemo	Yes , I am studying in Eastern Asian language department .
__label__noemo	Like Elvin . He isn't too happy about what you promised Stars.com .
__label__noemo	I ’ m awfully sorry to hear that . ( After checking ) I ’ ll turn to it right away . I do apologize . We ’ ll change your room to 2002 .
__label__noemo	I have been at my current job for 10 years .
__label__noemo	Come here at once , John . Will you ?
__label__noemo	What was that ?
__label__noemo	Can you help me find a pan ?
__label__noemo	For whom ? Cortex ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I have to stay in bed today , but I'll be able to come tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , Professor . I am going to miss next week's class .
__label__noemo	Well , I know a lot of people have guns there . I think maybe it isn't too safe .
__label__joy	Oh , yes . I heard there was an opera fans club . They are probably practicing now . Wanna have a look ?
__label__noemo	No , not at the moment .
__label__noemo	Well , I collect beer mats . I ’ m not sure that counts , though .
__label__noemo	I think he should be an expert of everything .
__label__joy	Really ? You ’ Ve helped me a lot . Thank you .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll stop by if I have time later . Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines .
__label__noemo	We needed larger premises so we moved to this greenfield site last year . It's nearer the motorway so it's better for transportation .
__label__noemo	I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track .
__label__noemo	That ’ s really cool .
__label__noemo	It spoiled my painting !
__label__noemo	In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause .
__label__noemo	Right . You have a choice of account , we provide USD , HAD , JOY and GAP accounts . Which do you want to go for ?
__label__noemo	Just some souvenirs .
__label__noemo	I'm glad to hear that . By the way , do you accept neutral packing ?
__label__joy	Yes . And I would like to convey my thanks to you for your help during my stay here in Nanjing .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll just have to put up with it .
__label__anger	What does a CEO do anyway ? I know the CEO makes the most money in the company , but what does he actually do ?
__label__noemo	Now , tell me what you often eat .
__label__noemo	I'm okay with walking .
__label__noemo	Let's have four coffees , please .
__label__noemo	buying a house can be expensive , but there are ways to find cheaper houses .
__label__noemo	We went out to the stadium . Bob hadn ’ t been to a game for a few weeks .
__label__noemo	It ’ s a chilly day folks , so don ’ t forget your coats ! What about tomorrow Kenny ? Do you have good news for us ?
__label__noemo	All right . Will there be anything else ?
__label__noemo	She's ten .
__label__noemo	Here ’ s an ad . about a big sale of washing machine . Do you want to see it ?
__label__joy	Good luck .
__label__noemo	Oh , she can make her own decisions .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	She freelanced with us for 3 years . She was always consistent and punctual with her assignments and a pleasure to work with .
__label__noemo	You just simply follow the instructions on the screen . You can inquire about your account information and use the self-service payment function .
__label__noemo	Oh no . the train hasn't been crowded at all recently . Besides , you're in first-class , so you'll be fine .
__label__noemo	Richard did , but I didn't . Of course , I told him I liked it .
__label__noemo	Well , I don't quite like the smell .
__label__noemo	I don't know . I'll have to ask my host mom .
__label__noemo	I beg your pardon ?
__label__noemo	Maybe you'll only feel that way on Father's Day .
__label__noemo	yes , I banged it against to cooker yesterday . It really hurt , but it ’ s OK now . the bruise will disappear soon .
__label__noemo	Okay , here you are .
__label__noemo	That's a good idea .
__label__noemo	No , I haven't discussed my leaving plans with my current employer , but I am sure he will release me .
__label__noemo	OK , the postage is 275 yuan .
__label__noemo	That ’ s interesting .
__label__noemo	Is there anywhere I can buy some more cards with beautiful scenery ?
__label__noemo	I want the best one .
__label__joy	Hi , Andy . I'm Judy . It's nice meeting you .
__label__joy	It's very kind of you .
__label__joy	Sounds good . But on Saturday there's a football final .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry but we are fully booked .
__label__noemo	Good idea . I noticed that on our way to the tower there are so many shops selling all kinds of souvenirs .
__label__noemo	Yes . Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	They should be there in the next hour .
__label__noemo	By the way , we would like to order some dishes for my friend .
__label__joy	Nice day , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	It's already 3 8 o'clock .
__label__noemo	Let ' s got out tomorrow night . We can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend .
__label__noemo	That was my favorite class .
__label__joy	Such as ?
__label__noemo	Then the standard that you set yourself originally must have changed .
__label__noemo	Oh , yeah . Thought I am an American , I know quite a lot about China and I like Chinese tea very well .
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
__label__noemo	A friendly one . I think an open , friendly , honest relationship should exist . An employee should feel she ( he ) can go to her ( his ) boss anytime with any kind of question .
__label__noemo	Are you sure you have the time ?
__label__noemo	No problem . We can offer you a flat with two bedrooms and a living room .
__label__noemo	Okay . Please take some fruit salad and crackers for me .
__label__noemo	You ’ re welcome . Can I ask you what brings you to China ?
__label__noemo	No , Rick is actually my great uncle , so he is my grandmother's brother .
__label__joy	Thank you very much . I will let you know as soon as possible .
__label__noemo	what's the puzzle ?
__label__noemo	Can't you see ? I'm practicing tai chi !
__label__noemo	No , I haven't got one . My employment petition hasn't been approved yet .
__label__noemo	I'm also going to add some layers to frame your face .
__label__noemo	Well , I ’ Ve heard many good things about it . I also like teaching young children .
__label__noemo	I've been offered another job with higher salary . And it also gives me the opportunity of promotion .
__label__noemo	Are the bedroom sets at IKEA affordable ?
__label__noemo	Well , I think something must be wrong with my bill . I didn't have any laundry .
__label__noemo	Comfort Inn , may I help you ?
__label__noemo	do you have any other plans this weekend ?
__label__noemo	Why are you so rude to your wife ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	That would be wonderful . The problem is I don't have an account with you . That is a problem , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	Oh , don't be so strict ! We are in Las Vegas .
__label__noemo	How many seats are there in the stand ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s time for me to go now .
__label__noemo	Yes , Friday I have a class , right after work .
__label__noemo	oh , that was just a quick bite to eat---that doesn't count !
__label__noemo	Hey , what's wrong with the TV ?
__label__noemo	Well , if you could send me your basic background information before next Monday , it would be useful .
__label__noemo	After a few years of gaining experience in the company and furthering my professional qualifications I'd like to put my experience and skills to use in management . I want to become a supervisor in your R & D department .
__label__noemo	To the restroom ? I have no choice .
__label__joy	Thank you , sir . Hope to see you again soon .
__label__noemo	Indeed . I've decided to go for the Petty Consumer Loan . That is , if my credit rating is satisfactory .
__label__noemo	Not untill the end of this year , you know , just before my wedding .
__label__noemo	Would you like to buy a bottle for me in the shop ?
__label__noemo	I want to come in the morning .
__label__noemo	My name is James Owen . I ’ m Manager of Sales . How do you do ?
__label__noemo	What do you think of the teacher ?
__label__surprise	Oh , I'm shocked .
__label__noemo	In that case , we will need to fill out this paperwork . Do you have identification with you ?
__label__noemo	Where are you going to find one ?
__label__noemo	Cash . But first , I need a lid for this pan .
__label__noemo	Yes . I have got two articles in English in The International Young Writer's Collection .
__label__noemo	You've decided that you definitely want to purchase this particular one ?
__label__sadness	What fools we were !
__label__noemo	Hold it , Mike . You won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? You worked it all up till now . Why not wait until you cool down a bit ?
__label__noemo	Do you know where your polling place is ?
__label__noemo	I'm in a bit of a hurry , Miss Liu . Can you wait for a minute ?
__label__noemo	Sorry to hear that . What happened ?
__label__noemo	Not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements .
__label__noemo	You owe me 19 dollars .
__label__noemo	Are you sure you have $ 100 in your checking account ?
__label__noemo	What ’ s going on ?
__label__noemo	that happens a lot in non-English speaking countries .
__label__joy	It ’ s my pleasure . Can I get you another glass of champagne ?
__label__noemo	All right .
__label__noemo	it's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
__label__noemo	But there are still other big problems we need to solve such as prolonged weightlessness , food storage , and a series of physiological effects .
__label__noemo	Hello , the International Hotel . May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Then I advise you to buy the LAY cleansing milk .
__label__noemo	very much . The birthday cake was delicious , wasn ’ t it ? Emily told me that she and karen made it themselves .
__label__noemo	Tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them .
__label__noemo	Yes , your seat is confirmed on that flight . Pls arrive at the airport one hour before departure .
__label__noemo	Let ’ s find out what time it starts .
__label__noemo	Did you know hat your actions might cause serous injuries or death ?
__label__noemo	In my opinion , there are several places you mustn't miss , like Washington D . C , Las Vegas , New York and Los Angeles .
__label__noemo	the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken .
__label__noemo	Firstly , it can overcome the geographic limitation . And secondly , e-commerce can lower the internal costs . And thirdly , people like us , can also open stores on Internet .
__label__noemo	Right . You know where that is ?
__label__noemo	No . Our check out time is still be eight thirty tomorrow .
__label__noemo	I think so.We certainly don't want a hijack to happen on the plane today .
__label__noemo	I don't care .
__label__noemo	Ten .
__label__noemo	Of course we will need proof , originals and duplicate of everything . As soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it , it should be very quick indeed .
__label__noemo	Yes . I heard he had a few broken bones too , but that the doctors have set the fractures without any problems .
__label__noemo	Your offer is way off the mark . It set me back only sixty-five .
__label__noemo	Yes . The re-inspection should be made within seven days upon the arrival , and if any discrepancy is found , the claim must be raised within one month .
__label__noemo	OK . Would it be all right to look at the room first ?
__label__joy	I just wanted to congratulate you ! I mean , it was a good race and you deserve to win .
__label__noemo	We do face a lot of challenges because there is still much uncertainty about the world economy . It's very important for us to strike a proper balance between investment in fixed assets and household consumption .
__label__noemo	How about Yanking Beer ? It's very popular here .
__label__noemo	I can't seem to find the cereal aisle .
__label__noemo	Did you know Carl is almost fifty ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I much prefer to go by car , then we don't need to get to the station with our luggage and ...
__label__noemo	I want to send this package to Los Angeles , please .
__label__joy	That sounds easy enough .
__label__noemo	Didn ’ t they let you go ?
__label__noemo	I can do that .
__label__noemo	When does the first period begin , by the way ?
__label__noemo	What about the Yellowstone National Park ?
__label__joy	So , want me to book the tickets again ?
__label__joy	Oooh ! One for each of the zeros in 2000 ! Wow !
__label__noemo	My friend needed me to help him .
__label__noemo	You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc .
__label__noemo	Sure . What do you want ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , I make certain . A half-price ticket cuts us one point five Yuan .
__label__noemo	Can she speak Chinese ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I can do that this afternoon .
__label__noemo	Yes , it is . How many pieces of hand luggage do you have ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I do . It save me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines .
__label__noemo	Wait a second . I want to watch Ally McNeal .
__label__noemo	Do you two know each other ?
__label__noemo	Well , we've finally put the finishing touches on the training programs for next year . Here's a report showing the projected costs as well as the expected return on investment .
__label__noemo	What's the climate like in your country ?
__label__noemo	Are you free this afternoon ?
__label__noemo	I only want it for the kitchen . I like to listen to the news at breakfast time .
__label__noemo	What kind of job are you looking for ?
__label__joy	Yes . We can make great efforts to make it become true as long as we have a clear goal .
__label__noemo	How about the Holiday Inn ?
__label__noemo	OK . Is there anything special you'd like to have on the menu ?
__label__noemo	Yes , that's right .
__label__joy	Good boy .
__label__noemo	I should be able to return by next Monday .
__label__noemo	I need to speak with David Lin .
__label__joy	I'd like that very much .
__label__noemo	Then let's stay in a motel . I am sure you will like it .
__label__noemo	Sounds like a lot of work !
__label__noemo	I see . We offer Agent Services free of charge here . Before your new business begins trading , we could , on behalf of your existing company , do a series of registration and get the certificates you need . If you are unsure of the local laws , that is .
__label__noemo	That ’ s ok . I should have told you earlier . This is a company rule .
__label__noemo	I would like to help you with both .
__label__noemo	I picked up some poison oak while hiking , and I can ’ t stop itching .
__label__noemo	That ’ s what my records show .
__label__noemo	Did this just start happening , or has it been going on for a while ?
__label__noemo	Are you a newcomer ?
__label__noemo	Then , do you have “ tea time ” every day ? I mean , do you drink tea at a settled time ?
__label__noemo	I hear you're being sent to Madrid for the annual conference . Is that right ?
__label__noemo	After a week , you ’ ll be running around here like a pro . Let me give you this list of departments first , next to each department is its location and the name of the manager .
__label__noemo	The Sunshine State certainly is worth visiting . Come down for a vacation sometime . I ’ ll take you to Disney World .
__label__noemo	Can I help you , Sir ?
__label__joy	July 4 , the National Holiday .
__label__noemo	Yes . Fortunately , I had my cell with me this morning . I called the police as I was running to get people to come to help .
__label__noemo	OK . I will do that .
__label__joy	I really enjoy the beach in the summer .
__label__noemo	Can I do anything else for you ?
__label__noemo	Ready for what ?
__label__noemo	Did you call the repairman ?
__label__noemo	All right . Are you married ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry but it is our regulation , so I must follow it . We will issue you with a receipt to show that the notes you presented us with are counterfeit and have been confiscated . Then , if you wish to pay in some more cash , you are free to do so .
__label__joy	All right , those sound good . I ’ ll take it .
__label__noemo	Speaking of classical music , we should never forget about the New Year's Concert of the Vienna Philharmonic .
__label__anger	Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash .
__label__noemo	No . I recorded these from your Cds .
__label__noemo	Is this your new teacher ?
__label__noemo	Could you tell me what Ants on the Tree is please ?
__label__noemo	Hello . What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s fine ... I need to pick up some stationary-you know , a stapler , scissors , files , who should I see about that ?
__label__noemo	most of the time we were lucky , but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room .
__label__noemo	You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets .
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__noemo	Sitcoms ?
__label__noemo	That's good advice .
__label__noemo	You are !
__label__noemo	Are there many accidents in the city every day ?
__label__noemo	As far as I remember , we sold about 40,000 pairs last year to you alone . Don't you think this annual turnover is rather conserve - time for a sole agent ?
__label__noemo	Wow , a real step up !
__label__noemo	I tell ya , when I got the invite , it really threw me for a loop . You've done a complete 180 .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . How much for one are these ?
__label__noemo	Sightseeing .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . I wonder if you can help me .
__label__noemo	That's a good idea . Why have I never thought of that ?
__label__noemo	What's the charge ?
__label__joy	Yes , I want to be her boyfriend . Just like in the movie .
__label__noemo	I think 2,000 would be enough .
__label__noemo	Just how am I supposed to do that ?
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve been taking vitamin C and zinc and trying to get some rest .
__label__noemo	Like what ?
__label__noemo	So , what is most important to you in a job ? Do you need job security or professional growth and a chance to advance ?
__label__noemo	OK , whatever , I don't want to hear about it . I'll call the doctor for you .
__label__noemo	What does he do there ?
__label__noemo	It isn't gratitude . It's fear . Vince is afraid I'll jump to a competitor .
__label__noemo	I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Monica to our company and introduce her to her department and colleagues . For all of you , we hired Monica because she is a very professional accountant and we are very happy to have her in the finance department . She has lots of working experiences as an accountant and I am sure everybody in the department can benefit from this .
__label__noemo	Well there is an important meeting with a new client .
__label__noemo	No , there is plenty of gas . I filled it up yesterday .
__label__noemo	Hurry up , guys ! The train is about to leave .
__label__noemo	You ’ re welcome .
__label__noemo	Could I have your name again , please ?
__label__noemo	Well , you can have it for eleven hundred — as a friend .
__label__noemo	That's right . As soon as I get home , I'll see about the opening of the letter of credit .
__label__noemo	When will the branch office open ?
__label__noemo	Are you French ?
__label__noemo	Is that what people usually do on Memorial Day ?
__label__noemo	Are you going to vote ?
__label__noemo	Hey , Mom , look what I found !
__label__surprise	Too sudden ! I'm not ready for it .
__label__noemo	Yes , she does . She works at home .
__label__noemo	I had no idea .
__label__joy	Thank you for the invitation .
__label__noemo	Yes ? How can I help you ?
__label__joy	All right . See you tomorrow night .
__label__noemo	It's nothing . It's not the first time anyway .
__label__noemo	Mm . In hundreds , please .
__label__noemo	Forget about it .
__label__noemo	Please tell me about work you have done , which qualifies you for this job .
__label__noemo	Bob from accounting is on the line . Do you want to speak with him ?
__label__noemo	Hum ... Why not go shopping the day after tomorrow ? Tomorrow is Saturday . I hate all the hustle and bustle of Saturday shopping .
__label__noemo	I think she has her ears pierced and she definitely has a few tattoos
__label__noemo	I see .
__label__noemo	Will that bus really take me to LA ?
__label__surprise	Not a single email until now ? it's already twelve o'clock . I can't believe it !
__label__noemo	Not now .
__label__noemo	Excuse me ?
__label__noemo	I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night .
__label__noemo	What a pity . Are you likely to be getting more in ?
__label__noemo	Thanks . If I ’ m interested , I ’ ll go to the library .
__label__noemo	Can I get dinner here ?
__label__noemo	Just once.Quite a few years ago we took the kids to Disneyland on our vacation.They had a blast .
__label__joy	Forget it . Good luck . I hope you can make it .
__label__noemo	What did you do last vacation ?
__label__noemo	A double room without a view for just one night ?
__label__noemo	I went to there on business .
__label__joy	Don't worry , dear . I'm a great host . Now get some rest . Merry Christmas .
__label__noemo	Could you please reserve a taxi for me ?
__label__noemo	Tomorrow night , then ?
__label__noemo	People are starting to get frightened by it . Everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder .
__label__joy	For us , karaoke is becoming a popular entertainment .
__label__joy	All right . Thank you for coming today .
__label__joy	That's great . I'm looking to borrow quite a large sum , though .
__label__noemo	"I said , "" Is there anything I can do ? """
__label__noemo	Can you help me find a pan ?
__label__noemo	I didn ’ t just find out about one job . There were several ones that looked good .
__label__noemo	I don't think so either .
__label__noemo	Sure . I'd rather show Bean in a garter belt , but all in good time .
__label__noemo	I am good at stewing beef with potato , frying chicken , hot and sour soup etc .
__label__noemo	I don't know yet .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	I'm here on business .
__label__surprise	Is she really ? I can ’ t believe it !
__label__noemo	But we ’ Ve only been on the road for ten minutes .
__label__noemo	He says he's just arrived in Scotland . He says he's staying at a Youth Hostel . You know he's a member of the Y . H . A .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry , sir . What seems to be the trouble ?
__label__noemo	No , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize .
__label__surprise	Really ? Good for you .
__label__joy	That sounds like a good choice for me . May I have one , please ?
__label__noemo	Left the next junction . Ok .
__label__noemo	Yeah . I have faith that he will help America turn over a new leaf .
__label__noemo	What about some steak ? This is a nice piece .
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve never had a bank account before . Why don ’ t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ?
__label__noemo	thank you . goodbye .
__label__noemo	What shall we do tonight ?
__label__noemo	An understanding of the basic workings of a company and the services or goods it provides is essential . Do you have that ?
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	So do I .
__label__noemo	Include endowment insurance , medical insurance , unemployment insurance , work-related injury insurance and maternity insurance .
__label__noemo	You mean noise ? How could it be ?
__label__noemo	He said that career in law was unsuitable for a women .
__label__noemo	What do you think about violence in movies ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m with you on that one . Anything else you ’ re planning on doing ?
__label__noemo	Where is it .
__label__noemo	6 million . You needn't pay the whole price at one time . You just pay 50 % in cash . We'll process the legal documents for you and then you can borrow the other 50 % from a bank and repay it in installments . We ask for only 1 % as commission .
__label__noemo	Actually , more and more people have realized that violence on TV may lead to the increase of crime rates among teenagers .
__label__noemo	May I come in ?
__label__noemo	Oh , not too bad . I'm just glad the weekend's finally here .
__label__noemo	They usually taste sweet , but they remind me of an orange .
__label__joy	Here you are , sir . I ’ m sure she ’ ll enjoy them .
__label__noemo	What ’ s the matter with them ?
__label__joy	So many places I have been looking forward to . We will take part in the group .
__label__noemo	First connect your laptop to the cable in the desk . Then open up your web browser .
__label__noemo	Where shall we go now ?
__label__noemo	They're in the blue cupboard . Anything else ?
__label__noemo	Have you ever shopped online ?
__label__noemo	What about restaurants and entertainment ?
__label__noemo	definitely . That's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes . Step inside , will you ? I'll give you an idea of what business I want to take up with you . Take a seat . We can go into details later .
__label__noemo	Why are you nervous ?
__label__noemo	ok . i've got a list of place that fit your requirements . let's just go through them . the first on the list costs 80 pounds a month , but it's on a noisy street and it's a little far from t
__label__noemo	Mountain biking is an Olympic sport ?
__label__joy	Hey , Blake ! Are you still listening to Mozart ?
__label__noemo	I need to open a second account .
__label__noemo	One hard-boiled egg with toast and orange juice to follow .
__label__noemo	I was born in Beijing , but I spent most of my childhood in London .
__label__noemo	Take the No . 7 bus . There's a bus stop just over there .
__label__noemo	It's nothing serious actually , doctor . It ’ s ... Well , I get tired very easily recently , and I often doze off during meetings , office hours and sometimes even while I'm dining .
__label__noemo	We ’ Ve got a lot of work to do now , but take your time over this project . We don ’ t want to make any mistakes .
__label__joy	Great . I will make my reservations as necessary .
__label__noemo	Oh , of course .
__label__noemo	I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening .
__label__noemo	Come on . We are going to be late .
__label__noemo	Bring them back to the circulation desk and renew them .
__label__noemo	I believe it happened last night .
__label__anger	Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant .
__label__noemo	Hi , Ann .
__label__sadness	Sorry , Sally , it's not your fault .
__label__noemo	Can she speak Chinese to her students ?
__label__noemo	Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department ?
__label__noemo	There . Stop !
__label__noemo	Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound .
__label__joy	Wow ! What a beautiful scenic spot ! It's so open . And just breathe that fresh air , you can almost taste its freshness .
__label__joy	We've missed you too . The office just isn't the same without you . How is your new job ?
__label__noemo	Good afternoon , I'm looking for Mr . Alert Li .
__label__noemo	Five tens , five fives and the rest in ones , please .
__label__noemo	Well , there are several things . Of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high .
__label__noemo	When will it be available ?
__label__noemo	Hi , Tony . Haven ’ t seen you for a long time . How have you been ?
__label__noemo	Well , every department is different . You wouldn't want your new co-workers to think you're a Grinch , right ?
__label__noemo	I'll call the bus charter later . And have you announced the itinerary of this journey to all of them ?
__label__noemo	Where are you ?
__label__noemo	I'll buy it for $ 2000 .
__label__noemo	Well , during school , they wanted good grades . Then after I got a job , they wanted me to get a better job . And finally , they want me to get married .
__label__noemo	Good morning . How can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Let me help you with that .
__label__disgust	Are all lucky people so stuck up ?
__label__noemo	May I ask for a wake-up call tomorrow morning ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it is , but you'll have to discuss the details with your manager .
__label__noemo	So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work .
__label__noemo	My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ?
__label__noemo	Now watch ... some guys probably run a light and hit your car .
__label__disgust	Oh , My God ! So much !
__label__noemo	What date is it today ?
__label__noemo	Yeah !
__label__noemo	Well , the best I can do is to lower the price by 5 percent if you are willing to pay 90 % cash of front and 10 % on delivery . That is our best offer .
__label__noemo	Ok , let's go .
__label__noemo	I remember you are in love .
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	One dollar to five franc . Is that alright ?
__label__noemo	Madam , patience is a virtue .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid you can't buy any medicine without a prescription from a doctor .
__label__noemo	Oh , hi , Mary , come on in . Any problem ?
__label__noemo	Las Vegas is in the southwest .
__label__noemo	What ’ s the problem ?
__label__noemo	I worked in a department store in a small town last summer vacation .
__label__noemo	The agent we are looking for will help us in Britain with publicity , advertising and so on .
__label__noemo	Just click on one of the choices they give you , and that ’ s it .
__label__noemo	Oh yes-five days a week.You have to visit customers all over the territory .
__label__noemo	It will be hard to say good-bye . This office has become like a second home to me .
__label__noemo	Certainly , Mr . Williams . Just one moment , please .
__label__noemo	Ah , here we are .
__label__noemo	my immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me .
__label__noemo	How about this pair ?
__label__noemo	Give me a break .
__label__joy	Oh , that sounds great . How about 6 o ’ clock ?
__label__noemo	just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week , ok ?
__label__noemo	What kind of job are you interested in ?
__label__noemo	What's the climate like in your country ?
__label__joy	How about Saturday morning ?
__label__noemo	Oh . I see . But I have done it .
__label__noemo	The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest .
__label__noemo	Yes , me too .
__label__sadness	I apologize for their tardiness .
__label__noemo	He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ?
__label__noemo	I think I'd rather have tea this morning .
__label__noemo	No , I just started working here at IBM , I am assigned sale department .
__label__joy	Ok , now for the last and best dish in my opinion . This is called Pad Thai . It's stir-fried noodles with eggs , fish sauce , tamarind juice , red chili pepper plus bean sprouts , shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander . It's practically Thailand's national dish !
__label__noemo	She is eight . Actually , I'm buying a good set of art supplies for her as a birthday gift .
__label__joy	That sounds good . I'll take the escalator .
__label__noemo	You made a good choice , then ?
__label__noemo	Margaret Mitchell .
__label__joy	Very good . But you should talk about your family , too .
__label__noemo	I'm glad to meet you , Sue . Please have a seat .
__label__joy	It's a piano recital . I'm fond of piano , you know .
__label__noemo	200 dollars per week .
__label__noemo	Have you booked the hotel for the reception ?
__label__surprise	What ? What did you buy ?
__label__joy	Certainly it is . It's worth an Academy Award .
__label__noemo	So do you think you can get to the office alone ?
__label__noemo	So they kept you at the station ?
__label__noemo	Well , there are two Hilton Hotels around here . Which one is your destination ?
__label__noemo	I think my English is fairly good . As you can see from my CV , I graduated from university with a B . A . degree in English . I studied the English language and English literature systematically .
__label__noemo	Come on , Mary . This is America . You make your own decisions here .
__label__noemo	That was delicious .
__label__noemo	How many children do Cindy and Ron have ?
__label__noemo	But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past .
__label__noemo	Well , no , it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ?
__label__noemo	that ’ s true . There ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . Music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character .
__label__noemo	Alright , give me the number . But put me on that waiting list as well .
__label__joy	Yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall .
__label__noemo	I think it's about time that we had to go .
__label__noemo	What sort of things do you grow in your garden ?
__label__noemo	I got it . When should I have her call you back ?
__label__noemo	Alright.Do you want your cuticles cut , too ?
__label__noemo	I couldn't agree with you .
__label__noemo	"You know what comedy I really like ? "" Ace Ventura , Pet Detective . "" I think Jim Carry is really funny ."
__label__joy	That's a good idea !
__label__noemo	Here is your change . Please wait for your receipt of the registered mail .
__label__noemo	80 yuan .
__label__noemo	All except the back door . I left that open for Tim . He took the dog for a walk .
__label__joy	Maybe now I ’ ll get that promotion I was hoping for .
__label__joy	Right now he speaks mostly English , and he can say a few Chinese words . But he will learn in the future .
__label__noemo	Good afternoon ! Sit down , please.How are you ?
__label__noemo	It wasn't all that great .
__label__noemo	What ?
__label__noemo	I'm not sure .
__label__noemo	Certainly , work always comes first .
__label__noemo	Yes , isn't it .
__label__noemo	Basically speaking , yes , we welcome the establishment of repry - tentative offices by foreign companies in Washington D . C . Of course , there are more details to be attended to . We cannot settle it in a few words .
__label__noemo	We import a little oil from Venezuela , but we are fairly self-sufficient . We import some iron and a lot of aluminium from neighbouring countries .
__label__noemo	What's new ?
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__noemo	Just a second . I'll have to check that . Anything else I can do for you ?
__label__joy	Thank you , Please have a cup of tea .

__label__noemo	OK , we will send a repairman to your room right now .
__label__fear	Oh , the final exam is coming soon . I feel a little bit nervous .
__label__noemo	i wish i could , but it's my mums birthday .
__label__noemo	no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions .
__label__noemo	Really ? Why is that ?
__label__noemo	That's the Return of the King , right ?
__label__noemo	Ms.Green , are the schools more or less similar everywhere throughout the United States , or do they differ in various sections ?
__label__noemo	Shall I make out a receipt ?
__label__noemo	For a week or so . Do you give discount for a week or more ?
__label__surprise	Good gracious ! Are you sure ?
__label__noemo	May I have a reservation ?

__label__noemo	I ’ m temping at a pharmaceutic company .
__label__noemo	No , no . Nothing at all like that . It's just that I applied for a credit card with you a while ago , my application was accepted , but I'm still waiting for my card .
__label__noemo	( Having lunch with Joseph ) Have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ?
__label__noemo	And do you usually part your hair along here ?
__label__noemo	Would you like a cigarette ?
__label__joy	Sure , I ’ m heading out myself . Enjoy your evening .
__label__noemo	Are you even listening ? I ’ m trying to have a conversation with you .
__label__joy	Just like in the States ! That's perfect !
__label__noemo	No , sir .
__label__noemo	I don't know how they function the next day ! It's like they eat and breathe soccer !
__label__noemo	In about one month .
__label__noemo	Spring Festival is the most important festival in China , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	Can you give her a message , please ?
__label__joy	You said you like classical music very much . Then who is your favorite opera star ?
__label__noemo	I've tried before . Everything I've tried doesn't work .
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	I don't have time to talk to her now .
__label__noemo	Did you tell your parents yet ?
__label__joy	Thank you for inviting me . Sounds lovely ! I would like to come . Where is your new apartment ?
__label__joy	Thanks for your help !

__label__noemo	I have to go to work .
__label__noemo	Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday .
__label__noemo	Were you able to see a lot ?
__label__noemo	That's it . I decided to turn over a new leaf . I'm going to exercise every single day .
__label__noemo	It's about a ten-minute walk .
__label__noemo	Will you let me know where to get off ?
__label__noemo	Well , I really like being with her .
__label__noemo	You mean the kind of stuff like Nirvana ?
__label__sadness	I've lost my Traveller's Cheques , all of them .
__label__noemo	About 12 . She is a good girl .
__label__noemo	My name is Woody .
__label__noemo	May I speak to Mr . Baker ?
__label__noemo	I've called you a hundred times today .
__label__noemo	When you woke up , the water was coming out the tub ?
__label__noemo	Yes , we have subtitles both in Chinese and English on the big-screen just beside the stage .
__label__noemo	Ok . Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	Have you signed up to join the company ’ s Christmas party ?
__label__noemo	Generally speaking , Mark's personality is much more agreeable than Jones
__label__noemo	Not bad . What did you do ?
__label__noemo	You just take them with you and trade them with the used textbook man just outside the door . Do you think you will be going there today ?
__label__noemo	Now that it ’ s the new year , I ’ Ve decided to turn over a new leaf .
__label__noemo	This is today ’ s schedule . At eight thirty , conference with the department managers . At 9 o ’ clock , live for the workshop where you ’ ll award prizes to the stafffor preventatives .
__label__noemo	But why are you overcharging me almost a thousand dollars ? 250 dollars a night , times three nights should just be $ 750 .
__label__noemo	Four - plus public holidays . I usually take two weeks off in the summer and the rest at New Year .
__label__noemo	Have you been to California before ?
__label__joy	Oh , hello , Mr . Campbell . I'm fine and Jack's doing well . How are you ?
__label__joy	Oh , I think I should try to read one .
__label__noemo	The one made in the early Tang period is bigger and has more characters on it , while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late Tang period . Look carefully , and tell me if you see the difference now .
__label__surprise	That's amazing !
__label__noemo	I feel like things are already changing , because he was elected .
__label__noemo	Honey , you can ask him to be quite . Otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ?
__label__noemo	Pardon me . Please speak a little louder .
__label__joy	Thank you . Good bye .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__noemo	I'm a professor at a university .
__label__noemo	All our scarves are in this section . What do you think of this one here ? It's made of silk .
__label__noemo	Is she old or young ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s great . Can you speak Chinese ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I have some fresh apples in my suitcase .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , will you change me some money , please ?
__label__noemo	Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down .
__label__noemo	I am running Chinese arts and crafts .
__label__joy	Thank you . Which gate should I go to for the bus ?
__label__noemo	I can't sleep ...
__label__noemo	You ’ re welcome . Feel free to ask me any time you need help .
__label__noemo	We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
__label__noemo	Well . The doctor doesn't see nobody without an appointment .
__label__noemo	I want to settle my account .
__label__noemo	Four ports .
__label__joy	I'm glad you like it .
__label__noemo	You may collect unemployment if you are working fewer hours or got laid off .
__label__noemo	San Diego .
__label__noemo	I hope so , too .
__label__noemo	Any other common customs of your New Year ?
__label__noemo	I lost one of my contact lenses , and I ’ m searching high and low for it .
__label__noemo	What would you like to change ?
__label__noemo	When does it arrive ?
__label__noemo	What about these ?
__label__noemo	Can short messages reach them ?
__label__joy	Fine , thanks . How about you ?
__label__noemo	And in the meantime , how do you pay the rent ?
__label__noemo	I guess you see the value in it , too .
__label__noemo	What do you think is the chief characteristic for a stewardess ?
__label__noemo	Is that so ? I'm afraid it is too narrow-minded to judge people using astrology . It's all stereotypes !
__label__noemo	Oh , hi , Donald .
__label__surprise	Really ? Can I join it ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m sure I can do it well . I ’ Ve always wanted to be the best in whatever I did . Give me a chance .
__label__sadness	I need to come to grips with his death first . And I also need to prepare a eulogy in case I'm asked to speak tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Could you put it in detail ?
__label__noemo	do you still like playing those games ?
__label__noemo	But I don't think she really loves him .
__label__noemo	What ’ s strength do you bring to the job ?
__label__noemo	Cockroaches , sir ? That's unbelievable .
__label__noemo	Don't worry ! There are a lot more prizes ! I know , because the prizes are all from companies that I work with !
__label__noemo	What are your strengths and weaknesses ?
__label__noemo	Are you completely out ?
__label__noemo	Right now , many girls are dyeing there hair blond .
__label__noemo	Your cousin Fay is fifteen . Rosemary is older than Fay . She's seventeen .
__label__noemo	If I were her , I wouldn't marry a man I don't really love .
__label__joy	I'm going on a guided tour in the mountain .
__label__noemo	No , don ’ t worry . Just follow me .
__label__noemo	That ’ s right , sir . Three nights at 500 dollars a night ... that comes to $ 1,500 .
__label__joy	You know , next week , we ’ ll hold a football match . Our cheering squad is busy rehearsing the programmes for it
__label__noemo	We cover the insurance and half the transport fee , and only have a discount of 4 % .
__label__noemo	I see . Should I have it bound ?
__label__noemo	One way trip . What's the fare , please ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I had a look just now , I feel we can do a lot of business in this line .
__label__joy	Yes , I know and I like it very much . I will take it .
__label__noemo	Where were decorating and I ’ m going to ask some things .
__label__noemo	Don't you know that ? It's all about new office rules .
__label__noemo	Can you change that for me ?
__label__noemo	I have thought about it for a while . I think it ’ s time to move on for both of us .
__label__noemo	That's the one .
__label__joy	I hope so , too . Thank you , Lily . Thank you for everything .
__label__noemo	Anyway , what really matters is that you have tried your best .
__label__noemo	May I have the bill , please ?
__label__noemo	I want to buy a bottle of perfume for myself .
__label__joy	Thanks . I'll need a while to choose.Could you come back in a minute ?
__label__noemo	Thank you for lending me the book .
__label__noemo	I've finished my white clothes . I need to wash the rest .
__label__joy	Well , the tapestry is delicate and beautiful .
__label__noemo	There is something in what you said , but what is the rent ?
__label__joy	That ’ s a nice dress . It ’ s very smart .
__label__joy	I ’ Ve been looking forward to meeting you . I am new to the working world and would appreciate your guidance .
__label__noemo	That would be great .
__label__joy	Here is the final draft of our contract . I'm glad that we have reached an agreement on almost every term in our trade .
__label__noemo	"Hmm ... Vanilla Ice ? I know his most famous song , "" Ice Ice Baby , "" but I don't know his other songs ."
__label__noemo	Please call me Jack . Have a seat , please .
__label__noemo	So after you noted the hours , starting at zero which is midnight , you just write down the minutes as a dot followed by minutes . Get it ?
__label__anger	Get out of my store , you jerk !
__label__noemo	Tom , hi , this is Mary with Gold Star Mortgage .
__label__noemo	We need to get you to an emergency room to see what the problem is .
__label__noemo	I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything .
__label__noemo	What are you doing ?
__label__noemo	That sounds comfortable .
__label__noemo	Well , don ’ t just sit there , do something . Come and help me in the kitchen .
__label__noemo	Raise the alarm by breaking the glass of the nearest fire alarm . Call Security , say ' Fire ' and give your name and exact location . At night you should phone the fire service from the nearest telephone .
__label__noemo	Your desire coincides with ours .
__label__noemo	Three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam .
__label__noemo	Just a second . I'll see if I can find them for you .
__label__joy	thank you . I'll be sure to take a look .
__label__joy	Well , the national anthem has just been sung , and the umpire has started the game . It ’ s time to play ball !
__label__noemo	Thank you . Please call me at any time if you have any questions .
__label__joy	Oh , you can't think like that . We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . You like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ?
__label__noemo	How many languages can you speak ?
__label__noemo	Do you want paper or plastic bags for your groceries ?
__label__joy	That's good . So I guess I'll have to make an appointment to see you .
__label__joy	Wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases .
__label__noemo	Is it nice ?
__label__noemo	I used to shop there , but I find the food at Whole Foods to be a lot better .
__label__noemo	I think you should do that soon . It will help you make a decision about the school you go to .
__label__noemo	If you want to live much longer you have to give up smoking .
__label__noemo	Thanks .
__label__noemo	I'm not an expert , but that's the impression I have .
__label__noemo	I have no idea what you are talking about . I just want to know if it ’ s good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
__label__noemo	I'll certainly look into that .
__label__noemo	hold it a second . I want to fix my hairpin .
__label__noemo	( Afternoon ) Miss Liu . Are you typing my report ?
__label__noemo	It's in the C building .
__label__sadness	Nothing . It's just one of those days . Everyone at the office is sick and I'm getting blamed for work not being done .
__label__surprise	What are you talking about , we've tried everything !
__label__joy	That's fantastic . I think I like this one .
__label__noemo	Are you broke again ? Let me treat you .
__label__noemo	I went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and I noticed that many people shouted for the bill .
__label__noemo	( Sign . ) OK , I signed the agreement with the signature of my name .
__label__noemo	OK , I'll take it .
__label__joy	Sure .
__label__noemo	I think that the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons . First , it ’ s just like a big party . They can meet each other and network . The other thing is that it is great advertising . All the journalists and photographers are there . Thirdly , it give them a chance to show what they would like to see people wearing .
__label__noemo	I see . Well , with those symptoms maybe you ’ Ve got food poisoning . What have you eaten recently ?
__label__noemo	Which models do you sell the most ?
__label__noemo	No , do you want to go and do something ?
__label__joy	What can I get you ?
__label__noemo	Yes . You know I ’ Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients .
__label__noemo	One of my neighbors has a dog .
__label__noemo	It ’ s $ 8.50 a month .
__label__noemo	Oh , we only take care of mail . For parcels , you can go to the next window .
__label__noemo	It wasn't that bad , and you're the one that insisted on skipping dinner.We went to an excellent restaurant .
__label__noemo	Well , what kind of books does she like ?
__label__noemo	I was hoping to talk to you today about your business .
__label__noemo	I understand . We propose a structured deal . For the first six months , we get a discount of 20 % and the next six months we get 15 % .
__label__noemo	Oh , I see .
__label__joy	My son , Harvey just got into Harvard ! He starts next September .
__label__sadness	Ouch ! I just bit my tongue .
__label__noemo	What are you going to do now , George ?
__label__noemo	Have you met the new girl ?
__label__noemo	This is a one-day trip . We ’ ll have to keep going and try to reach the top by noon or give up right now and go home . Which one do you choose ?
__label__noemo	No . We ’ ll get a cab . It ’ s faster than taking the bus or the subway .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t need two different accounts anymore .
__label__noemo	Thank you very much . I ’ Ve tried to keep it short and clear.If there ’ s any questions please feel free to ask me .
__label__noemo	What's going on here ?
__label__noemo	No . I didn't kill him on purpose , madam . It's him who caused the incident . I need to see my attorney .
__label__noemo	Is there anything I can do to help you ?
__label__noemo	What things am I allowed to check out ?
__label__noemo	All right .
__label__joy	Yeah , I ’ ll try to do the same.So , I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night ?
__label__noemo	Umm , OK . Whatever you think will help .
__label__noemo	Don't worry , it will work out fine once you get there . I'll see you then .
__label__noemo	And why are you returning them ?
__label__joy	I'm glad you like them . They are all made of silk . Here on display are all the most popular and favorite products . What items are you particularly interested in ?
__label__noemo	Then , let me check . For the large quantity you ask , considering the cost of raw materials , I think 13 dollar is our bottom line . And I can assure you this is the lowest price in the market in nowadays .
__label__noemo	That ’ s the best I can do .
__label__noemo	You know .. I have a weakness for long dresses .
__label__noemo	Two people chat on the Net and step by step fall into love ! It's Net Love .
__label__noemo	Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers .
__label__noemo	What's the fare for a first class seat ?
__label__noemo	Oh , it was okay . I had my meeting with Mitch this morning and his bottom line is that he thinks I need to show more initiative . He thinks that I need to start being more creative .
__label__noemo	I know , I know . Have you got a portable radio ? You can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time .
__label__noemo	I think I will start off in Paris . Then I ’ m going to take the train to Nice and then go on to Milan .
__label__noemo	It's just near the Dong Si Shi Tiao subway stop .
__label__joy	thank you for help.good bye .
__label__noemo	It's 1446 Pine Street .
__label__noemo	Not bad at all , thanks . There were one or two interesting people there.Why couldn't you come ?
__label__anger	I know where to put my card ! Stupid machine , talking to me like I ’ m an idiot ...
__label__noemo	Well , as long as I'm here .
__label__noemo	But a Chinese person would never order that .
__label__noemo	I'm sure they'll be fine once you break them in .
__label__noemo	About half a month .
__label__noemo	I have total faith in Obama as our President .
__label__joy	So , we could try that restaurant that was recommended in the guidebook . Then we could go to a club . We haven ’ t been to one for ages .
__label__noemo	Can you describe the situation at that time ?
__label__noemo	OK , we will try it .
__label__noemo	Um , let me see , romance , comedy . documentary , action , science fiction , animated and so on .
__label__noemo	In the summer it gets very hot.the temperature is often between 37 and 40 centigrade.when it is hot we often get rains.the winters are drier .
__label__noemo	I read in the poster that you're looking for a student to work as a language assistant .
__label__noemo	Well , that was tough .
__label__noemo	This is a circuit board .
__label__noemo	I don't think so.It ' s kind of sore .
__label__joy	That's good . So I guess I'll have to make an appointment to see you .
__label__noemo	I was thinking of seeing You , Me and Dupree . It's a typical Hollywood blockbuster .
__label__surprise	I don't believe it .
__label__noemo	I think that's a bunch of nonsense . It seemed ok to me .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Yes , it is .
__label__noemo	Did you need help with something ?
__label__noemo	Very good , you majored in International Trade ?
__label__noemo	I would like to do that .
__label__noemo	How do you get through the stuffy daytime ?
__label__noemo	I've just been working really hard .
__label__noemo	No . I ’ m a little worried about security . You never know who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren ’ t you worry about that ?
__label__noemo	I see . Yeah now that I think of it , I wouldn ’ t have gotten married if I hadn ’ t moved to this town and met Sally .
__label__noemo	No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too .
__label__noemo	If you'd just give me your number and insurance , then I'll handle it .
__label__noemo	What do you mean by us ?
__label__noemo	What is it ?
__label__noemo	Hi , Bob . What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Do you really like this straw hat , dear ?
__label__joy	I bid on a Chanel watch at the last minute , and got it sixty percent off !
__label__noemo	Yes , I got it . Come on , Benjamin , don't let him get into the paint .
__label__noemo	No , I haven't . Why ?
__label__joy	I really like apples and grapes .
__label__noemo	Can you help me pick out a gift for my daughter ?
__label__noemo	The woman who won the 1500 meters also broke the world record by 2 seconds .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , waiter , could you bring me some barbecue sauce ?
__label__joy	OK . I hope so .
__label__noemo	What will you have ?
__label__noemo	Are you planning on voting ?
__label__noemo	Is there anything else I can do for you ?
__label__noemo	yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm i

__label__noemo	My vote was for Barack Obama .
__label__noemo	Your BAC exceeds the legal limit .
__label__noemo	May I have your key please ?
__label__noemo	Then would you kindly come to our shop with the receipt by 10 o'clock , we'll replace it .
__label__noemo	This morning , when we woke up , there was water pouring in from the ceiling !
__label__noemo	No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs .
__label__joy	actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . I made far too much food to eat alone . I am glad you could come over to help me finish it .
__label__noemo	It costs a lot of money . Hospital bills had already made deep in-roads into our savings . Do you think the rest of your salary will be enough to cover our daily expenses ?
__label__noemo	I was sick .
__label__noemo	I think he is around here . Can you slow down ? Ah , there he is .
__label__surprise	That's incredible ! She has such a sharp figure .
__label__anger	I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job !
__label__noemo	Can a handset case be changed ?
__label__noemo	No , not yet . Is it good ?
__label__noemo	Actually , it's better ...
__label__joy	We've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger .
__label__noemo	No surprise . The over-the-top promotion has ruined the audiences ' appetite .
__label__noemo	I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that .
__label__noemo	The rest of us will have this today's special , please .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , how do I get to the Forbidden City ?
__label__noemo	Hello . Excuse me .
__label__joy	Pleased to meet you , too , Shirley . So , what do you do ?
__label__noemo	That's very nice of you . I guess I could use some help .
__label__noemo	Oh this is hard ! Well , I ’ ll see what I can do .
__label__noemo	It's simple . You can use call transfer .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , could you please turn on the air-conditioner , it's so hot here .
__label__noemo	Goodbye .
__label__noemo	You can say that again .
__label__noemo	So , now we have covered all the important points .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t you agree that all the thieves should be punished by cutting off their fingers ?
__label__noemo	The purpose of each test is given on the site .
__label__noemo	Can I bring you anything else ?
__label__noemo	Oh , come on . Tell me please . Why did you book tickets to Paris ?

__label__noemo	thanks . Where shall we put our luggage ?
__label__noemo	What movie are you and your friend planning on watching ?
__label__noemo	Sure . Kind acknowledgments can show one's good attainment .

__label__noemo	that's a good idea . Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius ?
__label__noemo	It must have taught you a lesson this time .
__label__noemo	Well , I planned the layout of the newspaper and then I assigned various articles and columns to other students to write . I wrote the editorial each time .
__label__noemo	Oh , I see .
__label__noemo	Sorry . There aren't any tickets available for the 19:00 train .
__label__noemo	How do I know if I qualify for unemployment benefits ?
__label__noemo	Thank you so much .
__label__noemo	The people have spoken .
__label__joy	Nice to meet you , too .
__label__noemo	Sure . Basically we have two insurance policies for employees ... workman's compensation and medical insurance . The company pays the premiums for workman's compensation , and for a significant part of the medical coverage , but you pay part of that premium , too .
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__noemo	I'm from England .
__label__noemo	When did it become CABS ?
__label__noemo	But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better .
__label__noemo	Can I sit down now ?
__label__noemo	May I see your passport please ?
__label__noemo	What would you do ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s not a very good idea . It ’ s quite hot outside . Why don ’ t you smoke outside ?
__label__noemo	Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection .
__label__noemo	you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ?
__label__noemo	What exactly did you do at that company ?
__label__noemo	Both a Telegraphic Transfer and a SWIFT transfer will normally be credited to the payee's account within three or four working days , depending on whether the beneficiary's bank is among our correspondent banks or we have to route the transfer through a third bank .
__label__noemo	Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia .
__label__noemo	It's ZN741 to Atlanta on July 1st .
__label__noemo	I did self-study of Japanese in college , and I can carry on some simple conversations in Japanese .
__label__joy	Thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . Is that common ?
__label__anger	Oh , how annoying !
__label__joy	That's nice and easy . Thanks for your time .
__label__noemo	No , I don't think it could be . I checked the battery two days ago . It must be other problems .
__label__noemo	And you'll repair the television , won't you ?
__label__noemo	Oh , that's how you see it .
__label__noemo	I want to find a job in your bank as an accounting clerk .
__label__noemo	Yes , that's right .
__label__noemo	But what if I need my money suddenly ?
__label__noemo	I understand . For now , though , you could just give us an estimated price.We aren't going to sign a contract yet . We are just investigating . I only need to know that your company is capable of producing the products.And then , I only need a very rough idea of how much it might cost .
__label__joy	OK .
__label__noemo	Good morning , sir . Have a seat please .
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__joy	Oh , they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if I remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ?
__label__noemo	Which company are you from ? I'll check your details .
__label__noemo	The morning one , please . I want to go coach .
__label__noemo	I'll call you later .
__label__noemo	So I hear .
__label__noemo	No , sir . It's a genuine bonnet .
__label__noemo	It looks great .
__label__joy	Believe me , the time will fly by ! Before you know it , you'll be changing diapers ! You have to start preparing !
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	My sister already gave him one . I like something unusual .
__label__noemo	Maybe you are right .
__label__noemo	Jimmy , I ’ d like to wear this robe for tonight cocktail party . What do you think of it ?
__label__noemo	By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday .
__label__noemo	This cloakroom is open until 10 p . m .
__label__noemo	You are under arrest , sir . You have the right to remain silent . You better not pout , you better not cry . Anything you say can and will be used against you . You have the right to an attorney . if you cannot afford one , the state will appoint one for you.do you understand the arrest to you ?
__label__noemo	What would you do at the party ?
__label__joy	OK ! I'll show you how my mom did it .
__label__noemo	yeah , but I ’ m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset .
__label__noemo	Hi , nice to hear from you , when does your plane leave ?
__label__noemo	This watch is supposed to be worn on your left hand .
__label__noemo	I think the course at Leeds University is interesting , but I think the one at Manchester University would be more practical .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll check for you .
__label__noemo	Can you tell me about some good deals on produce ?
__label__joy	When did you learn to dance ?
__label__noemo	I have a stomachache .
__label__joy	Sound great . Let's go !
__label__noemo	We usually offer on a net basis only . Many of our clients have been doing very well on this quoted price .
__label__noemo	You should wear a formal dress and be confident .
__label__noemo	Yes , I do .
__label__noemo	Pardon me , Miss . But didn't you order chicken soup ?
__label__noemo	Which ones ? Let me have a look . Wow , look at that ! That brings back memories ... That ?
__label__noemo	You'll be sorry if the boss finds it out . He may probably give you the bag .
__label__noemo	Ho , no !
__label__noemo	Hello . May I speak to Brian , please ?
__label__noemo	I feel absolutely horrible . My temperature is 41 degrees Celsius , and I've got a headache and a runny nose .
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	When is your garden at its best ?
__label__noemo	Okay , I'll see you at 6 o'clock . Do you need any directions ?
__label__noemo	Oh , thank you .
__label__noemo	No , I listen to background music .
__label__noemo	Yes , one last thing . How much holiday time do you give your employees every year ?
__label__noemo	indeed , no man can be perfect . He is just so-so in crashing the boards . Usually he plays shooting guard . Rebounding might not be his strong suit .
__label__noemo	It's actually a lot cheaper for me to wash my clothes here .
__label__noemo	Where can I call a taxi ?
__label__noemo	That's OK . Is anything else recommended ?
__label__joy	Check out your mom's closet . I'll bet she still has something .
__label__noemo	Hi , I'm Benjamin . Nice to meet you here . You look great .
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry , Janice . But we ’ Ve been waiting on the client . It ’ s out of our hands at the moment .
__label__noemo	Were you here last week ?
__label__noemo	They're much better
__label__noemo	No , that won ’ t be necessary .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid it's a bad news for you . There are some problems in your supervised goods .
__label__noemo	Fine . Listen . Are you free on Wednesday night ? I'd like to invite you to dinner .
__label__joy	Your garden is really lovely .
__label__joy	The Mountains would be a great place for the company retreat .
__label__noemo	Then , turn on the lamp , please .
__label__noemo	Hang on one second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella !
__label__noemo	Why didn ’ t you just stay at PCC ?
__label__noemo	Yes , of course . We could split it . What part would you like to do , the food or the entertainment ?
__label__anger	I'm very annoyed at your disobedience .
__label__noemo	I'll have supper with my girlfriend and go shopping . What about you ?
__label__noemo	I really couldn't understand him .
__label__noemo	thanks . Would you mind taking a look at the layout ? Do you think it ’ s appropriate ? I want it to be formal , but not boring to look at .
__label__noemo	Why not ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , the people are quite relaxed ... Those were some great times I spent there . Well , thanks for stopping by . Are you from King Dao , Yang Tang ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m surprised to hear that . I thought you had some very good suggestions .
__label__joy	Sounds good . The food there is fantastic too .
__label__noemo	Superintendent .
__label__noemo	Good morning .
__label__noemo	Jenny , you look terrible . What's eating you ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to buy some postcards of Beijing .
__label__anger	You won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ’ Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime !
__label__joy	Hey , young man , you are so deep today .
__label__noemo	Okay , then a third one for my husband too .
__label__noemo	Well , I'm not sure . Maybe it means we can buy something through the Internet .
__label__noemo	Okay , I'll get you one .
__label__noemo	If a consumer complains about the quality of your products , what will you do ?
__label__joy	Let's go to Starbucks and think of something to do then .
__label__noemo	Why don't you speak English ?
__label__joy	Thanks , I will .
__label__surprise	Haven't run into you for ages !
__label__noemo	Give me one coke , please .
__label__joy	Thank you , see you then .
__label__joy	We've never sold this much before , our growth this year has been phenomenal . We have captured 8 % of the market , up from last year by 120 % . Our strategy is working !
__label__noemo	Would you like a dessert ?
__label__noemo	Well , make sure to put out the pepper and salt shakers . I don ’ t know if your brother is coming tonight so set an extra place mat just in case .
__label__noemo	Books , cosmetics , daily necessities , even large electrical appliance can be ordered from online-stores .
__label__noemo	Well , when you see the blue spots with the handicapped logo , do not park there unless you have a special permit . Are you going to be parking in the daytime or the evening ?
__label__noemo	Oh , nothing much really . And how is everything with you ?
__label__noemo	Will you have desert to be , madam ?
__label__noemo	Who is responsible for the accident ? Is it Tony ’ s fault ?
__label__noemo	But that makes thirteen people ! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday !
__label__noemo	I ’ m new here and I can ’ t seem to find the lunch room .
__label__noemo	Good morning . I need to speak with the property manager , please .
__label__noemo	Do you need any more of these shirts ?
__label__noemo	Are you out of your mind ?
__label__noemo	You know what ? I don ’ t think I can hack it here out in the countryside . I ’ m going back to the city !
__label__noemo	Yes . She teaches our class three times a week .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , is this seat taken ?
__label__noemo	Sunny and mild today , cloudy and rainy tomorrow .
__label__noemo	what do you mean ?
__label__noemo	Need a gift for your girlfriend or wife ?
__label__noemo	I'm not sure . Let me think about it .
__label__noemo	what ’ s wrong with it ?
__label__noemo	May I have a look at that vase , please ?
__label__joy	How nice of you to remember !
__label__noemo	I often do , but I ’ m worried about the responses from other people .
__label__joy	Not at all .
__label__noemo	Try this one . Same aluminum pan , but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle .
__label__noemo	What if I can't finish them by then ?
__label__noemo	I have a terrible toothache .
__label__noemo	that's excellent ! Have you received your conditional offers yet ?
__label__joy	I think that looks like a very nice house . Is it on our Internet listing for Open Houses ?
__label__noemo	If I had chance again , I'd major in English . You're good at language .
__label__noemo	I ’ m thinking something exciting but . safer .
__label__noemo	Wait . I want to ask you if this bus goes down Fifth Avenue as far as Greenwich Village .
__label__sadness	That's all right .
__label__noemo	No way . I'll never find another apartment around here . But I don't like the idea of paying three months ' rent on an empty apartment , either .
__label__noemo	Well , I want to deposit 2,000 yuan into my account .
__label__noemo	Hold on for a moment . ( a few minutes later ) I have cancelled your reservation.Shall I make another one for you ?
__label__noemo	In the dining room . It's spacious there .
__label__noemo	Room 1019 .
__label__noemo	Can you pass me the lighter ?
__label__noemo	Is it on Xinhua street ?
__label__joy	Isn't this lovely weather ? Will you help me water the flowers , Jack ?
__label__joy	Really ? I think you ’ ll love it .
__label__noemo	One time , I tried garlic ice cream .
__label__noemo	But this should have been handed in last Thursday .
__label__noemo	Do I eat the seed ?
__label__noemo	My name is Luo Gang , and the phone number is 513-3284 .
__label__noemo	Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ’ d only hurt you , I know I ’ d only make you cry .
__label__joy	Good . Are you going to the pub tonight ?
__label__noemo	What's wrong ? You are like a little monkey , on pins and needles !
__label__noemo	Yes . Is this Paula ?
__label__noemo	Passengers holding first class tickets may carry 2 pieces within the total weight of 5 kg onto the plane .
__label__noemo	OK , I'll search it for you . A moment , please .
__label__joy	Quite well , thank you .
__label__noemo	yeah . We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners .
__label__noemo	You're in luck . Two of them have dancing figures .
__label__noemo	I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out .
__label__joy	And so I bought all these books on having kids and ...
__label__noemo	I just got off the subway . I'm almost there . Sorry I'm late .
__label__noemo	I am Molopo and my room is 5022 .
__label__noemo	I can ’ t control the temperature .
__label__noemo	We'll go to your house and repair it on Tuesday.Ok ?
__label__noemo	I'll have that too .
__label__noemo	I have a bad headache , but ...
__label__noemo	It's not breathing !
__label__noemo	Gotta go . Call me tonight .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t think he ’ s back today .
__label__noemo	Everybody is buying them .
__label__noemo	No . Not now . I think I'll try to keep this one .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Please , George .
__label__noemo	I informed my company and was told that the first five thousand by the end of this month .
__label__noemo	I am sorry , I didn ’ t catch what you said . Could you repeat it please ?
__label__noemo	He seemed to be dumped by his girlfriend . I found his blogs were a little sad .
__label__noemo	Which bus should I take ?
__label__noemo	Does this suit come in other color ?
__label__noemo	in China at least , coffee is often associated with an exotic , well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle . Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated , middle-class people .
__label__noemo	Do you want the whole minibar , or just certain items ?
__label__noemo	What do you do for a living ?
__label__noemo	Well . There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them .
__label__joy	You are welcome , Mr . Sun .
__label__sadness	I am sorry to make you run down to the office for me .
__label__noemo	What can I get for you ? Here is the menu .
__label__noemo	Needless to say , it must be Indian Yoga .
__label__noemo	Excellent . How many would you like ?
__label__noemo	I enjoy Thai or Japanese the best .
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome . What ’ s the problem ?
__label__noemo	What else should I be thinking about ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I know . I must get my traveler ’ s check and some foreign currency .
__label__noemo	You shouldn't drink soda when you're really thirsty .
__label__noemo	That ’ s better . Now what ?
__label__surprise	Really ? Then I'm really lucky . Oh , it's spewing fireworks from its huge mouth .
__label__joy	Good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ?
__label__noemo	You think ?
__label__sadness	I'll try . I'm under a lot of pressure right now .
__label__noemo	Thank you ! I'll be sure to return the favor after our first class , OK ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s right , once a week . Do you want to order some pizza ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I have . I was employed by the financial section of the university ever since I graduated . I worked there for 3 years . Then I had worked in a bank for 3 years .
__label__noemo	My favorite is to play computer games .
__label__noemo	According to usual practices , we serve dishes first and then soup . If you like we'll bring you some soup first .
__label__noemo	Yes , it is not easy .
__label__noemo	Three . Two adults and one kid .
__label__noemo	Oh , steve . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What if he doesn't call ?
__label__sadness	I think I'm too clumsy . I can do nothing well .
__label__noemo	Ok , did you find a new company ?
__label__noemo	Yes ?
__label__noemo	Would you come here in twenty minutes ? We're right in the middle of dinner .
__label__noemo	No , but I've got a headache .
__label__noemo	Thank you , sir . Sorry to trouble you .
__label__noemo	I don't really like seeing bloody frames , but I appreciate the lifelike frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects .
__label__noemo	That fee should keep you from overdrafting .
__label__noemo	Your assistant gave wonderful directions .
__label__noemo	If one is rich , is the happy ?
__label__noemo	Thanks very much .
__label__noemo	Absolutely not . The windows must be measured , and then the curtains need to be made professionally . So that will take a while . Maybe a month or so .
__label__noemo	Will I be finished then ?
__label__noemo	Yes . My name is Charles .
__label__noemo	yes .
__label__noemo	Bob and I plan to play hockey in the morning .
__label__noemo	No , I hope not . I want to have a deck chair and enjoy the crossing .
__label__sadness	I ’ m sorry to hear about that .
__label__sadness	I ’ m sorry . I think you are calling the wrong person . My name is not Mr . Bernie .
__label__noemo	Is 6 o ’ clock Friday evening okay ?
__label__noemo	What was so bad about it ?
__label__joy	That ’ s right .
__label__noemo	I plan to repay it within 2 years . And the interest ?
__label__noemo	No worries . I just for her card . And you can get her from Email . I would really like to talk to her again . I kind of miss her a little this days .
__label__noemo	Certainly . My phone number is 626-555-1739 .
__label__noemo	Do you have a credit card with us ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it seems that way to me also .
__label__noemo	Because Myra was cheating on exams.and she spoke back rudely .
__label__noemo	What time dose it start ?
__label__noemo	About three days .
__label__noemo	Not only is it affordable , but it comes with all the appliances .
__label__noemo	What kind of flowers would you like ?
__label__joy	Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal .
__label__joy	Hobbies are great . I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do .
__label__noemo	I am sorry , we don't know the extent of the delay at present . But according to the latest weather forecast , there will be a change in weather soon .
__label__noemo	Well , What kind of movies do you like ?
__label__noemo	Yes . Choose the service you need to use . If you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want .
__label__noemo	She's the one who saved the life of my son at the beach last year .
__label__joy	Thanks million .
__label__noemo	He sounds hot ! What does he do for a living ?
__label__noemo	Can she speak Chinese to her students ?
__label__joy	Good evening , Mr . Smith .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t mean to interrupt , but can you tell me what plans you have for growing the youth market ?
__label__noemo	I really want to make something for dinner .
__label__noemo	I'm terribly sorry to be so late . I had an article ...
__label__noemo	And how much for haircut with shampoo ?
__label__noemo	I need to talk it over with my wife .
__label__noemo	How far is it from our hotel ?
__label__noemo	Yes , this is . What number are you calling ?
__label__noemo	Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details .
__label__noemo	How long have you been in America ?
__label__anger	The tapping of your pen on your desk . It ’ s driving me crazy .
__label__noemo	Oh , you know , we are not middle-aged . You're old , and I'm aging .
__label__noemo	I agree that it was bad service , but I heard one of the other waiters mentioning that it was our server's first night on the job .
__label__noemo	I was told I should have the letter sent directly to your office .
__label__noemo	Yes , that's possible .
__label__noemo	Yeah . They promised to stick together forever when they were young .
__label__noemo	How much are you asking ?
__label__noemo	I watched TV .
__label__noemo	Hi , I'd like two tickets to Providence , please .
__label__noemo	So , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?
__label__noemo	Right . Later he was a soldier and a fireman in the village . When he was middle aged , he became a great man , quite famous .
__label__noemo	Yes , I ’ m doing some research on Roman civilization . Do you have any books on the subject ?
__label__noemo	I mean he's a student developing all round .
__label__noemo	How are your wedding plans going ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m sure you ’ ll find our price most favorable . Elsewhere prices for hardware have gone up tremendously in recent years . Our prices haven ’ t changed much .
__label__joy	Hey , Mary , nice to see you again . I heard you're going back home to the U . S .
__label__noemo	You shouldn ’ t work so hard .
__label__noemo	good luck !
__label__noemo	... Now , that's all I want to say about world coal reserves . So let's move on to the next topic , renewable resources . There are three things we have to consider when talking about renewable resources . First , sustainability ; second , marketability ; lastly , the reality factor . Let's talk about each point in more detail ... John , would you like to take it from here ?
__label__noemo	Oh yeah . It loses only a few seconds in the whole month .
__label__noemo	Mr . Smith , I have been doing some industry research and was shocked to learn that the average salary for a position that is similar to mine pays on average $ 2,000 more per year than I am c
__label__noemo	What's your name ?
__label__noemo	Apology is accepted . Try to do better next time .
__label__noemo	Professor , I am going to need to leave class early today .
__label__joy	I like that suggestion . Show me one , please .
__label__noemo	I couldn't keep from laughing throughout the whole movie .
__label__noemo	OK . You may wrap it now . Please fill in this form and label it . ( after a moment ) Would you like it registered ?
__label__noemo	Yes , his IQ is high enough for him to embrace the success as long as he can manage his EQ .
__label__noemo	How was your appetite ?
__label__noemo	I'll be with you in a minute .
__label__noemo	Which tests do you mean ?
__label__noemo	The cause is another boy .
__label__noemo	That it easy.They get caught before they come here .
__label__noemo	No , we used to be on an industrial estate on the outskirts of York .
__label__noemo	What ’ s wrong with it ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to book a room , please .
__label__noemo	We would like you to stop by again so we can show you some more problems that have come up with our apartment .
__label__noemo	You missed a really good game .
__label__noemo	Same hours as on the weekdays .
__label__noemo	I won ’ t beat around the bush . Sir , I would like a raise . I currently have three companies after me and so I decided to talk to you first .
__label__noemo	All right . Thank you .
__label__noemo	I want to buy a shirt .
__label__noemo	Oh , it ’ s a pity . What was the matter ?
__label__noemo	No one else has made an offer , so you could make another offer if you want to do so .
__label__joy	Oh , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance .
__label__noemo	How do you spend your spare time ? Are you interested in sports ?
__label__noemo	I blew the finally exam .
__label__joy	OK.Thanks for asking me .
__label__noemo	I will .
__label__noemo	Hello , this is Lucy from ABC Company . Is this Monica ?
__label__noemo	Somewhere new . It's a great place to pick up chicks .
__label__noemo	I'm from California .
__label__noemo	No , I haven't . What about you ?
__label__noemo	Good afternoon . What can I do for you today , Madam ?
__label__noemo	There ’ s some , but I don ’ t think it ’ s a big problem . A lot of it is petty crime , burglary and car theft . There ’ s very little major crime .
__label__noemo	I prefer it to working independently . I think most people do .
__label__noemo	Definitely . Would you like skim or whole milk ?
__label__joy	That's the plan .
__label__noemo	I'm looking for a citizen for my wife's birthday .
__label__noemo	Oh . Thanks . Look , I must just go and say hello to someone . I'll be right back .
__label__noemo	How do you spell you first name ?

__label__noemo	Where is your fitness facility located ?
__label__noemo	Certainly , sir . There ’ s a flight at 8: 35 a . m . and one at 10 .
__label__noemo	I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution .
__label__surprise	Well , I am really surprised . By the way , have you done anything behind my back ?
__label__noemo	Well ... er ... it is just ... just that I ...
__label__noemo	I want to be an English professor in the future . I love studying literature , and I want to teach it .
__label__noemo	My goodness ! Your family must live in a huge house .
__label__noemo	Just relax , listen carefully to the questions , and be honest in your responses .
__label__joy	This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ?
__label__noemo	A little bit . I'll take a look if you want me to .
__label__noemo	Certainly . May I ask who ’ s calling , please ?
__label__noemo	it certainly was a great party . It ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here .
__label__noemo	I scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago .
__label__noemo	I was thinking of seeing You , Me and Dupree . It's a typical Hollywood blockbuster .
__label__noemo	OK , it's open .
__label__noemo	How often do you play tennis ?
__label__noemo	We've received some similar comments from other Australian firms too .
__label__joy	They'll still charge us a corkage fee .
__label__noemo	I don't think I'm going to get one .
__label__noemo	I want to make a deposit .
__label__noemo	Yes , of course .
__label__noemo	What ? How come ? The third time ?
__label__noemo	This is the schedule for the project . Any comments or questions ?
__label__joy	Well how about meeting at my place ?
__label__noemo	What is it ?

__label__joy	Thank you ! What about your daughter , Pamela ? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently .
__label__noemo	There ’ s a typhoon coming .
__label__noemo	Oh , yeah ? I wonder who is going to give Jane away at the wedding . You know her father passed away several years ago .
__label__joy	sounds a good idea .
__label__noemo	First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan .
__label__noemo	Acupuncture may cause just a little pain , but it also causes a certain feeling of numbness and distension.We ' ll try it every day for seven days.Will that be all right ?

__label__noemo	If that ’ s the case , then why did you leave ?
__label__noemo	All right .
__label__noemo	exactly .
__label__surprise	My goodness , I didn't realize it was that bad .
__label__noemo	Frightened ? You must be joking .

__label__noemo	It could be the battery . Let me Check it .
__label__joy	I appreciate that .
__label__noemo	Well , Jim . It is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals .
__label__noemo	You have a talent . You just don't know what it is yet .
__label__noemo	No , I didn ’ t . I gave them a really good clean , so they just look new . The worktop was in poor condition , so I had a new one added .

__label__noemo	Oh , well . It was fun to be the winner . But ... it's too big . I must be an extra small in the States .
__label__noemo	Well , I prefer active rather than passive training . For example , I like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin . They sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice . All employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room , so we could communicate with each other . We had a lot of fun learning together . It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t see it on the shelf .
__label__noemo	What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	do you have anything to declare ?
__label__noemo	Exactly . I had tons of ideas that I wanted to share , but they just wouldn't let me finish . What should I have done to get my point across ?

__label__noemo	Well , I can only give him these for now , and after a couple of weeks I can administer the rest .
__label__noemo	Sure . Here you are .
__label__noemo	Well , that sounds like it would be OK . Just be careful .
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve been to other Scandinavian countries , but not to Norway . Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there .
__label__noemo	Yeah , are they easy to look after ?
__label__noemo	May I suggest you consider buying him a DVD player instead ?

__label__noemo	Who's that tall guy over there ?
__label__noemo	There will be a parade to celebrate National Day this weekend .
__label__noemo	There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission . It seemed to fizzle out . Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner ?
__label__noemo	A good idea . They can teach elephants to dance nowadays perhaps there's hope for us !
__label__noemo	That ’ s too bad . Is there a desk in the living room then ?
__label__noemo	Can you help me now ?
__label__joy	I'm really pleased with it . Thanks .
__label__surprise	For real ?
__label__noemo	Are you leaving ?

__label__noemo	Well he ’ s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories .
__label__noemo	That is very kind of you to offer to do that . Can you start with the pages on the table ?
__label__noemo	I have three years of teaching ESL and four years of teaching per-school children .
__label__noemo	Men are like that you know.They can feel nervous , anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness .

__label__noemo	It's a light blue coat . It's got a hood and a big silver zipper .
__label__noemo	Yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle , don't you ?
__label__noemo	About my driving test , did I do well ?
__label__anger	Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles !
__label__noemo	I usually go in my free time on the weekends . How about you ?
__label__noemo	Well , it pays off for her . How old is she anyway ?
__label__noemo	I couldn't sleep well recently .
__label__noemo	I can't agree with you . She's pretty , but she always blows hot and cold .
__label__noemo	I see . How do I draw money for my own use then ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I have my learner's permit .
__label__anger	I don't understand why I'm being arrested .
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	Hello , how are you ? I am Jack .
__label__noemo	How do you do ? Mr . Barker .
__label__noemo	I went to the doctor yesterday .
__label__noemo	When will you lecture begin ?
__label__noemo	Awesome . I've been giving this a lot of thought . When can we do this ?
__label__noemo	Yes , here you go .
__label__noemo	no , it's ok . Check your email first ; I'll check my unbox later .
__label__noemo	When is it ?
__label__noemo	Maybe you are right . OK , I'll take it .
__label__noemo	Have you tried an outlet ?
__label__noemo	That seems like a good idea , it's for wages , you see .
__label__noemo	Linen.It ' s ideal for summer wear .
__label__noemo	Oh , that's all right .
__label__noemo	Should I come to the second floor or do you want to come to the first floor ?
__label__joy	Not to mention cooler . Did you go swimming ?
__label__noemo	Our representative in your country faxed a letter that you showed an interest in some of our products on display at the Oct . Exhibition there . Now we'd like to know if you have any specific requirements in mind .
__label__noemo	I hope so . too . But I still think the provision of arbitration is of great importance to both of us .
__label__noemo	Well , would you please come back fifteen minutes later ? We are to visit the Tower .
__label__noemo	No problem at all , sir . Housekeeping will deliver you all the amenities you like in a bit .
__label__noemo	What if an employee was injured due to work-related job ?
__label__noemo	Hello , I'm here to talk to someone about a Fixed Asset Loan .
__label__noemo	Let me see . Ok , this way , please .
__label__noemo	He has reached puberty . His mind and body both will change a lot .
__label__noemo	I only want a little off the top and the sides and back to have clean lines .
__label__noemo	That's a hard time.The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy .
__label__noemo	I am kind of nervous .
__label__noemo	Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep ?
__label__noemo	Well , it ’ s really too late . I have to go now .
__label__noemo	Yes , it's perfect .
__label__noemo	Just a second . I'll go get some .
__label__noemo	What's the quickest way to get there ?
__label__noemo	I thought the starting salary is too low .
__label__noemo	I see . I'll do it for you .
__label__joy	Yeah , we had a great time . And we're going to go there again next week !
__label__anger	Then stay away . Nobody's keeping you from doing that .
__label__noemo	I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself I think . A friend in need is a friend in deed.The more really close friends I have , the better .
__label__noemo	Yes , sir . That's correct . How will you pay your bill , cash or credit card ?
__label__noemo	That's exactly where I was planning to go !
__label__noemo	Yes . I like Carmen very much . But I don't mind if you want to tell me about this one .
__label__noemo	In what ways ?
__label__joy	Yeah . Other than that , the real feature is the excellent drinks . Can I have your ticket ?
__label__noemo	Would you tell me how the inspection is conducted before shipment and by which agency ?

__label__noemo	A Russian man broke the discus record by a centimeters . Out best athlete broke his personal best in the long jump , but it only got him third place .
__label__noemo	Are you working under pressure ?
__label__joy	I think I'll have a glass of wine . Let's see ... they have red wine , white wine and port . They even have sangria ! It's the happy hour special .
__label__noemo	Would you love to introduce me to her ?
__label__noemo	Here you go .
__label__noemo	We've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings , so you won't need to deal much with the transportation system .
__label__noemo	Earning extra income on the Internet is easier than you might think . After I started selling traditional craft items on the Internet last year , I have really been able to make bank doing something I love .
__label__noemo	Oh , I feel miserable . I've got a bad cold , My head is dizzy and my nose is running .
__label__noemo	Hi , Mr . Smith . I'm Doctor Hawkins . Why are you here today ?
__label__noemo	I feel quite embarrassed for having to request a pay raise so quickly .
__label__noemo	Yes . Steven Smith , room 609 .
__label__disgust	That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
__label__noemo	Hangzhou food .
__label__noemo	If you like you can wait here . They will be ready in one hour and a half .
__label__noemo	I prefer free sketch , especially the landscape paintings . I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings .
__label__noemo	Is this your first time flying ?
__label__noemo	It's been a long time , Mrs , Lee .
__label__noemo	What time is now ? Do you have the correct time ?
__label__noemo	Want to meet for lunch this Saturday ?
__label__noemo	And what ’ s Mrs . King doing ?
__label__noemo	The essence of filing I remember is to bring together in a single folder or file all papers relating to a particular subject . And outgoing and incoming letters are kept in this file cabinet .
__label__noemo	Ok . Then I can make up my mind .
__label__noemo	Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly .
__label__joy	Anytime . You can reach me 5558929 .
__label__noemo	How to do it ?
__label__noemo	You sound like the TV ! You're not going to tell me that aliens built the Pyramids , are you ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , that's why I'm here . My friends dragged me here , because they think I spend too much time studying .
__label__noemo	Not at all . But I've found satisfaction in it !
__label__noemo	When did you begin to smoke ?
__label__noemo	What made you transfer ?
__label__noemo	orange
__label__noemo	Mumm . no .
__label__noemo	Listen to this . Mary got married .
__label__noemo	Oh , I don't think I will buy a used sofa even it looks so attractive .
__label__noemo	We are on the high way . I'm the * * .
__label__noemo	I'd believe it . She owns magazines , television shows and she has a huge fan base .
__label__noemo	That's right . I feel it's always better to go in with both eyes open , if you know what I mean .
__label__noemo	yes , but not fluently .
__label__noemo	You're welcome . If you ask the conductor when he comes by , he should help you find one .
__label__noemo	You're got a point there.But do you think he's a little absent-minded ?
__label__surprise	Really ? How much is it ? Oh , it's 42 yuan ! How expensive !
__label__noemo	Excuse me . I ’ m a stranger here and lost my way .
__label__sadness	That's bad ! I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line has been busy.Will he be back soon ?
__label__noemo	Could I list my interests and special skills next ?
__label__noemo	Why are you washing your clothes here now ?
__label__noemo	I'm not disciplined enough I guess .
__label__noemo	If you had a box made in the ' 20s , that would be nice .
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve been getting really short of breath , and my coach wanted to have a doctor check me out .
__label__noemo	Well , I ... I guess the weather . And the people . They were all very friendly to me .
__label__noemo	How moving love is .
__label__noemo	To the airport please .
__label__surprise	Really ? Even for such an excellent one ?
__label__joy	Thanks , Jim . I didn ’ t think guys paid attention to stuff like that .
__label__surprise	What do you mean ?
__label__joy	I ’ ll drink to that !
__label__noemo	I'm just fine , thanks , Jane . I'd like to make a withdrawal from my Current Account , please .
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry , sir . I ’ m going to have to take a look inside your bag .
__label__noemo	I hope so . I guess I won't be sleeping for the next 3 days . That's what it'll take .
__label__noemo	Good day . I ’ m looking for a one-bedroom apartment today .
__label__noemo	Hmm . Let's see ... there was Good Morning , Vietnam , Dead Poet's Society , The Fisher King ... Three , right ?
__label__noemo	Ah ! I get your point . We have just what you need . Our Jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . The one bedroom apartments are very economical , but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . I think you can find the right apartment there .
__label__noemo	It's a little like being a mom , only I get paid for it !
__label__noemo	Is there any cheaper one ?
__label__joy	No , I mean it . Look , are you hungry ? Shall we go get something to eat ?
__label__noemo	I'll try to change one to a different day .
__label__noemo	Oh , no . You see I'm in the middle of something . Could he wait ?
__label__noemo	Nothing . Maybe it is just the weather . Rainy days often make me feel a little sad .
__label__noemo	Yes , the company will also give me a prize of 1,000 Yuan .
__label__noemo	Yes , I have .
__label__noemo	is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike ?
__label__noemo	I felt dizzy when I stare at those shining lights . What should we do firstly ?
__label__anger	that seems like an awful waste ! Why don't people order fewer dishes so that they don't have to throw so much away at the end of the meal ?
__label__noemo	Do you think you'll still love him when he is old and gray ?
__label__noemo	Well , they have different rooms . I lift weights by the pool where there aren ’ t so many people .
__label__noemo	I'm going to need it for three days .
__label__noemo	What does the price in different kinds of invoices include ?
__label__noemo	We need to consider several other applicants and we hope to make a decision by the end of this month . We will call you regardless of whether you are hired or not .
__label__noemo	I see , that's a long time.How much was the watch ?
__label__noemo	ok . Should I heat the wok ?
__label__noemo	I've seen at least nine different cockroaches in my room .
__label__noemo	Can I help you , sir ?
__label__noemo	I played outfield . I hated the infield because I never figured out all the bounces .
__label__joy	I like the cool smell , too .
__label__joy	Thank you ! I will . When and where will the dinner be ?
__label__noemo	I have the same idea as yours .
__label__joy	Congratulations . That's great !
__label__joy	Do you mean the red things ? They are roses .
__label__noemo	Your medical card No . , please ?
__label__sadness	Well , I haven't been eating well , I guess . I usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch .
__label__noemo	Our cousin went into labor and had her baby last week .
__label__joy	Their flesh is soft and juicy . It has a citrus taste . It's sweet .
__label__noemo	Well , this one is worse .
__label__noemo	I want to send some important documents to Canada for my postgraduate admission .
__label__joy	Oh , right.Thanks for your help .
__label__noemo	We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education .
__label__noemo	True , but I still have to watch my baseball . The season's in full swing now .
__label__noemo	Well , I work very long hours , ten hours a day is quite normal . And if something important comes up , I ’ m often in the office until 8 or 9 in the evening .
__label__noemo	O . K . Do you have your receipt ?
__label__noemo	I'll take one , too .
__label__noemo	No , I didn't .
__label__noemo	Oh come on , it's not that bad .
__label__noemo	I honestly couldn't see it because of the bushes growing over it .
__label__noemo	I go occasionally when there's a game on near home , but usually I watch it on TV .
__label__joy	Here's your change , 50 Yuan . Welcome back again .
__label__joy	Thanks so much . I owe you one .
__label__noemo	I am sure you can do better than that .
__label__noemo	You should hand it in before next Sunday .
__label__noemo	I see , and how about the documents and the information ?
__label__surprise	Really ? Why ?
__label__noemo	Yes , but I doubt if I get it . I've never got it .
__label__noemo	I like to play computer games , read books , go shopping , and play pool .
__label__joy	I know you have a tight schedule , so I won't take up more of your time . Have a good evening .
__label__noemo	I ’ m returning a book .
__label__noemo	Can she speak Chinese to her students ?
__label__surprise	It ’ s unbelievable . He used to be such a rough guy .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Perfect . Thank you . Bye ...
__label__noemo	Are you ready to order , sir ?
__label__noemo	Yes , we do offer that package .
__label__noemo	Ok , I am coming .
__label__noemo	Hey Nick , what are you up to ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it is . Please put your luggage on the scale .
__label__sadness	Oh , Kate ! I ’ m sorry . It completely slipped my mind !
__label__noemo	Hello , Ellen .
__label__noemo	Where can we climb it ?
__label__joy	Sounds great , I'd very much like to accept your invitation , thanks , when ?
__label__noemo	Good morning . I need a new identification card .
__label__noemo	I feel totally refreshed .
__label__noemo	Can you do that in the mornings , or would the afternoons be best ?
__label__noemo	Why do you read them ?
__label__noemo	Do you know the day they plan to open ?
__label__joy	Good to see you too !
__label__noemo	Yes , you can have a Money Link card . You can also base the account on time deposits . The choice is yours .
__label__noemo	I hope that it does rain .
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve got a fever and really a bad headache .
__label__joy	She is absolutely wonderful .
__label__noemo	What have you got ? A cough ? A cold ?
__label__noemo	Come on , 18 points already , they are never gonna catch up .
__label__noemo	What's up , buddy ? You look so upset .
__label__noemo	$ 850 a month .
__label__joy	It does sound wonderful , maybe I'll try it .
__label__noemo	I can ’ t seem to make a decision .
__label__noemo	Sure thing . Do you want me to give you a ride home ?
__label__noemo	New York Airport.May I help you ?
__label__noemo	I don't have an aspirin . Perhaps you should go to a doctor .
__label__noemo	No . We took a wrong turn somewhere.And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost .
__label__noemo	I think I may rent out this apartment that I found .
__label__noemo	yeah . It seems like we don't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .
__label__noemo	No . Peel the skin with a sharp knife , and throw out the seed .
__label__noemo	Fine , I'd like two enlargements from this negative .
__label__noemo	Could you do me a favour ? Please give me some confidential information .
__label__joy	Don't you think it might be a good idea to hold the party outside ?
__label__noemo	Her birthday is on the 9th . We ’ re going to have dinner at a Mexican restaurant , and then maybe go out dancing .
__label__noemo	here's Lisa . May I take a picture with her ?
__label__noemo	Sure it is . I really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
__label__noemo	How about afternoon ?
__label__noemo	How do I know if it's ripe ?
__label__surprise	Really ? It sounds interesting .
__label__noemo	Well , it seems we have covered everything . We'll have the contract ready in a couple of days .
__label__joy	No problem . I'll do that for you .
__label__noemo	There's one at 19:00 and the next is at 19:40 .
__label__noemo	Is there easy access to the attic ? We'd better look since there may be some flooding there as well .
__label__noemo	What time was it when you went up there ?
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve been feeling a little light-headed lately .
