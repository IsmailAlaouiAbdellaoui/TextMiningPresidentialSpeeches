__label__noemo	Alright . Have a nice trip .
__label__noemo	I thought Henry usually did the conferences .
__label__noemo	Today is December 23,2002 .
__label__noemo	Sorry , I can't dance .
__label__noemo	I wish I could , but it's already late .
__label__joy	Wonderful !
__label__noemo	I already looked .
__label__noemo	Didn't anyone stop them ?
__label__noemo	That sucks .
__label__noemo	Who will sing in the show ?
__label__noemo	You ’ ll need to make an appointment to view the apartment .
__label__noemo	is that inflation ?
__label__joy	Well , that sounds just wonderful .
__label__noemo	No , it won't .
__label__noemo	Candlelight in the Window
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve been busy with a first aid course that I started about a week ago at the Red Cross .
__label__noemo	Yes , they do .
__label__noemo	Tell me more .
__label__noemo	how big is a shuffle iPod ?
__label__noemo	I would like to order some internet today .
__label__noemo	So it seems . And what are you going to do about that ?
__label__noemo	No , But does that matter ?
__label__noemo	I see . What is it exactly that you are interested in ?
__label__joy	I'm glad you feel that way.We ' ll leave in about ten minutes , alright ?
__label__noemo	Are you on a tourist visa or a student visa ?
__label__noemo	that was a great party . Thanks for saying behind to help me clear up .
__label__noemo	Well , I hope so . The competition is probably pretty heavy.And they want a writing sample too .
__label__noemo	What should I take first ?
__label__noemo	Do you have any suggestions ?
__label__noemo	Yes , maybe I should .
__label__noemo	I am sorry , but I cannot stay for the rest of class today .
__label__noemo	Yeah . They suit each other . A perfect match between a man and a girl .
__label__noemo	I ’ m thinking about where we shall spend our vocation .
__label__noemo	I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it mys
__label__noemo	What's that ?
__label__noemo	What's wrong ?
__label__noemo	No , the yellow ones .
__label__joy	Bye .
__label__noemo	Well , it depends on the journey . It's .. I guess it's not too expensive , but the minimum price you would pay is , for a short journey , is about a pound .
__label__noemo	This is Milton in room 402 . I would like to check out . Can anyone help me with my baggage ?
__label__joy	you see ? You ’ re becoming more decisive already !
__label__noemo	I saw your green post-it notes . Nobody else has them .
__label__noemo	No . I'd like tea . Can you put it in my favorite cup ? You probably washed it ...
__label__noemo	Only in this way can you leave the interviewer a good impression and achieve success .
__label__noemo	Well , I understand that . Your request is approved . Remember to give my best regards to your parents .
__label__noemo	I think you need to update your CV . Bring it over to my office tomorrow and I'll help you with it .
__label__noemo	Jim !
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve got her a birthday present and I ’ ll take a bottle fo wine too .
__label__noemo	I would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable .
__label__noemo	NO !
__label__noemo	My pleasure , Sir . Bye .
__label__noemo	When I was a little boy , I had a dream of becoming a lawyer .
__label__noemo	I can see that . But why are you reading advertisements for houses for sale ? Are you buying a house ?
__label__noemo	I love that shirt on you .
__label__noemo	How about the languages .
__label__joy	I'd be up for that !
__label__noemo	It is serious .
__label__noemo	what did you put in that punch ? It tasted great , but was quite strong .
__label__noemo	Yes , some exercise is necessary for us .
__label__noemo	The machine says your card was declined .
__label__noemo	It goes all the way there ?
__label__noemo	Well , thanks . I will come again this afternoon , then .
__label__noemo	But don't you want to study music ? Shouldn't it be easy ?
__label__noemo	I am more interested in a full-time position . However , I would also consider a part-time position .
__label__noemo	Do you have your library card with you ?
__label__noemo	Last weekend , while they were on the Sik trip .
__label__noemo	I'm from CTC Trade Company . Here is my card .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t forget to also get a new mixer . I lent the old one to my brother and he broke it .
__label__noemo	They must . Let me look at that.Here it is . Cortex . It's on the second floor , next to the Roll booth .
__label__noemo	Haven't you been listening to a word I've been saying ?
__label__noemo	It's three different flavors mixed together . Chocolate , strawberry and something green with candied fruit .
__label__noemo	He was on the diving team with me in high school and saved my life one day .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Concerning our financial position , credit standing and trade reputation , you may refer to Bank of Hong Kong , or to our local Chamber of Commerce or inquiry agencies .
__label__noemo	It's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it .
__label__noemo	What are you doing this weekend ?
__label__noemo	No tipping ? Now that's what I call a civilized system .
__label__noemo	How long will you be there ?
__label__joy	It really is . Do you have time to eat dinner and catch up ?
__label__noemo	Because of pollution and other things , our environment has become worse and worse .
__label__noemo	Sure , the Huanghe carp with sugar and vinegar is famous in our restaurant .
__label__noemo	What is this made of ?
__label__noemo	I am competent in using Word , Excel , Windows and other commonly used softwares .
__label__noemo	Good morning , Miss .
__label__noemo	I was in New York for a wedding .
__label__joy	Yes , that one is very nice .
__label__noemo	Well , sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently .
__label__noemo	Does she have any piercings or tattoos ?
__label__joy	I really did ! I started thinking about what I wanted to say three weeks ago .
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Considering that it's over ninety degrees outside , that would be weird .
__label__noemo	Eating here or to go ?
__label__noemo	Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right .
__label__noemo	This isn ’ t the first time you have been considerably late with the rent . I need to start the procedure to evict you .
__label__noemo	Maybe you should communicate with him like a friend and not a boss .
__label__noemo	Yes , I have good working conditions and I would require a salary at least 15 , 000 $ a year .
__label__noemo	Yes . Is that available now ?
__label__joy	If you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ?
__label__noemo	Fine ! I ’ ll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low in fat . Are you happy now ?
__label__noemo	Your room number is 210 . The bellboy will show you the way there . I hope you enjoy your stay .
__label__noemo	Did it ever shrink or fade ? Generally speaking , the dark-colored clothes always fade away gradually .
__label__noemo	As in English , Chinese also has some lucky numbers . The number 9 stands for perpetuity in Chinese .
__label__noemo	The only time we can come on Friday is at 3
__label__noemo	At the gym ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me . When is breakfast time ?
__label__noemo	that's fine . If you want , you can sign up for a pre-sessional interview .
__label__noemo	You could save a couple of dollars by taking it to the dump yourself , though .
__label__noemo	Do you think so ? I ’ m not so sure . Anyway , tell me your plans for an Australian holiday . How long do you think we should spend there ?
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__noemo	I was wondering if you could company me to the Ball ?
__label__noemo	I'll give you the boxes . You can then go to our gift-wrapping department .
__label__noemo	how many chapters does the book have ?
__label__noemo	I think there's someone at the door . Excuse me while I go and get that .
__label__noemo	That ' s true , but what if one comes across some difficulties . He must rely on his EQ to deal with them .
__label__noemo	They come from tropical countries .
__label__noemo	And where are you from , Jack ?
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__noemo	Well , he shouldn't be long . He said he was just going to get some paint . But I wouldn't be surprised if he's stopped off at the pub on the way back .
__label__noemo	Where does a broadcast company get most of their information ? I hope it's not just from press releases .
__label__noemo	Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department .
__label__noemo	Yes , it runs till the end of the month . But things are clearing out fast .
__label__noemo	It was OK . There was a lot of turbulence , though .
__label__noemo	Could you get me the pepper from the cupboard ?
__label__noemo	Don't remind me of that . This would be the last time I cut any classes for a basketball game .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll report it honestly . I ’ ll give a correct analysis . I may quit the job - and pay compensation . But I have my way to judge whether I fail .
__label__noemo	Like what ?
__label__noemo	Would she be interested in a laptop ?
__label__noemo	Sort of yes .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry to hear that . May we meet the day after tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	There's someone coming .
__label__noemo	Well , where shall I pay the duty for the whisky ?
__label__noemo	How can I tell if they're ripe ?
__label__noemo	no , just soda .
__label__sadness	I think it's bleeding .
__label__noemo	Did you remember to lock your door before you left then ?
__label__joy	pretty well . I don't know if I'll get the promotion or not , but I feel good about it .
__label__joy	Sound like everything is great .
__label__noemo	I'm not sure , but still it did attract a large crowds today .
__label__noemo	No , I haven't got one by now . I will go to the interview of yours .
__label__noemo	Of course . Mary is our most experienced member .
__label__noemo	Luckily that was nothing serious .
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__noemo	Yes , I have a driving license .
__label__noemo	Do put yourself on a diet , otherwise you'll be too fat .
__label__noemo	Here we are .
__label__noemo	Jane , pleases come with us .
__label__noemo	That ’ s right .
__label__noemo	Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others .
__label__noemo	I am in hot water now , all the things seem to be blown up .
__label__noemo	That's right.After their school day is over , they go to a special institute to study math or English.They are very serious about learning over there .
__label__noemo	No.But it's a bit strange today .
__label__noemo	Good morning . I have a Bill of Exchange against Bank Acceptance here . I'd like to discount it . Is that possible here ?
__label__noemo	The bus is cheaper but also slower . It will take about two-and-a-half hours .
__label__noemo	That'll be 14 dollars in all .
__label__noemo	That's $ 150 .
__label__noemo	You can say that again !
__label__noemo	Are dresses going to be on sale ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s out of the question .
__label__noemo	oh , it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs . When did you get started ?
__label__surprise	You are kidding ! He just broke up with Ann .
__label__noemo	I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .
__label__noemo	Yes , everything.They don't have the most expensive brands , but their quality is usually decent.The main thing is , they have good prices , and they are very convenient .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , what do you want for this bag ?
__label__noemo	But we have only moderate mean at hand . If you can do us a special favor this time and allow us to delay payment , we'd really appreciate it .
__label__noemo	Please fill out this form , sir .
__label__noemo	I ’ m in need of your services .
__label__noemo	I think I ’ m going in the wrong direction , aren ’ t ?
__label__noemo	My sister and I usually go to the laundromat down the street . Why don't you go there ?
__label__noemo	Wow ! What happened to you ? You look sad .
__label__noemo	I spent the morning at the cemetery . I put flowers on the graves of my old war buddies .
__label__noemo	I went shopping .
__label__noemo	Have you got a scholarship , or are you on your own ?
__label__noemo	It's very pleasant .
__label__noemo	I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle , but when I feel lazy , I drive my car .
__label__noemo	Sure that ’ s fine.This is so awkward ... what ones do I pick ? What size is she ?
__label__joy	Yes . He ’ s so energetic . We take him out to the park every morning and evening . I think he ’ d be happy to stay there all day !
__label__noemo	I hate dentists .
__label__noemo	Then you can help her with the breaststroke and sidestroke .
__label__noemo	That ’ s not a bad idea .
__label__noemo	It's too expensive .
__label__noemo	Roman is living in Rome , of course . And go to work by car , or bus , or on foot .
__label__noemo	Hey ! I learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
__label__noemo	Maybe you're right . But I'm still worried .
__label__noemo	Do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
__label__noemo	I read it myself on the financial page.They ' re really going to join together . U-Tunes was bought out by Murphy's , they will take over the company as of next month .
__label__noemo	Yes . Can you tell me what the interest rate is now ?
__label__joy	Hey , Philip ! You won ’ t believe this !
__label__noemo	Oh , I know . Thank you .
__label__joy	Wonderful ! Do you already have your work schedule ?
__label__noemo	Japanese teams always play a dark horse .
__label__noemo	He is tall and slim , fair-haired .
__label__noemo	What kind of business do you do ?
__label__noemo	and she was in a movie once again , right ?
__label__noemo	Can you eat the nut ?
__label__noemo	That's a gay bar .
__label__noemo	We don't think so . Casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes .
__label__joy	I greatly appreciate this .
__label__noemo	If I am not in the service center , I will assist others in resolving the consumer complaints . And pass the criticism on to the relevant department .
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve got 30 cousins on my mom ’ s side and 10 cousins on my dad ’ s side .
__label__joy	Just nice water , thanks .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , could you tell me which bus I should take to go to the railway station ?
__label__noemo	If I were him , I wouldn'tbrazen it outby asking my parents for money .
__label__noemo	How long does it take for the bus to get there ?
__label__noemo	The location of my polling place never came in the mail .
__label__noemo	Do you prepare some dessert for me ?
__label__noemo	That is the library . And it has more than 1,000 , 000 books .
__label__noemo	But where's the switch ?
__label__noemo	I feel dizzy and I have a headache .
__label__noemo	Grandpa , this restaurant looks really old ! How long ago was it built ?
__label__noemo	Let's see . How about a nice shirt and tie ? You can't go wrong there .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I guess I should .
__label__noemo	I want to try my hand at the stocks .
__label__noemo	They don't really fit you right .
__label__noemo	A radio , a color television , a telephone and a major international newspaper delivered to your room everyday .
__label__noemo	Oh . Ok . And are you open on the weekends ?
__label__noemo	I want to buy one to match my shirt.Can you give me some advice ?
__label__noemo	OK , I'll get it . It's for you , Jeff .
__label__noemo	What kind of card ?
__label__noemo	About 300 a month .
__label__noemo	What time should the taxi be here to pick you up ?
__label__joy	No , thanks Mom . I'd like some toast and chicken wings .
__label__noemo	Why don't you start cooking then ?
__label__noemo	I don ’ t know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children !
__label__noemo	Bob was late for work this morning .
__label__surprise	Do you like my carpet ? Be honest ! Tell me what you really think .
__label__noemo	Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t notice it . Sorry .
__label__noemo	Apology is accepted . Try to do better next time .
__label__noemo	not yet . She's pretty tame . I think she must be used to being around lots of different people .
__label__noemo	I've absolutely certain .
__label__noemo	Hi , Randy . What are you doing right now ?
__label__noemo	No , they are in a position of leadership and have more experience than normal account managers , but they do not directly supervise others . They are not members of the managerial staff and will not be included in our training .
__label__joy	Look ! This picture of Mom in her cap and gown .
__label__noemo	First you have to put the car into gear . Move this shifter so the arrow points at D for drive .
__label__noemo	I think it's the most successful film in scene-setting and music .
__label__noemo	Steven , I'm going abroad by plane for the first time tomorrow . Can you give me some advice ? And what should I pay attention to ?
__label__noemo	I think I have a piece of apple pie .
__label__noemo	Yes , he's breathing , but he's not conscious ! Oh , please hurry !
__label__joy	I find the Chinese dishes wonderful .
__label__noemo	Our room hasn't been cleaned up yet.So would you send one of your house keepers to clean up our room .
__label__joy	That's great . But can't you make the rent cheaper , Let's see , 12,000 yuan ?
__label__noemo	In particular , I'm interested in marketing in the domestic field .
__label__joy	We appreciate hearing that about you !
__label__noemo	The meeting really didn ’ t go down well at all . I think I need to read up about intercultural communication before I have another meeting with someone from another country .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	How about mileage and gas ?
__label__noemo	I want my money back for the delivery .
__label__joy	No , I ’ m on a vacation to see the famous Three Gorges .
__label__noemo	Do you believe in god ?
__label__noemo	What ’ s it for ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it is .
__label__noemo	Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ’ ll look at something in a shop , but later buy it online if it ’ s cheaper . You don ’ t like buying things online , do you ?
__label__noemo	Nothing much . I'm just relaxing today . Why ? What's going on ?
__label__noemo	48C . It's on your left hand side .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction .
__label__noemo	I prefer the food at Whole Foods .
__label__noemo	Please excuse me , but I really have to be going .
__label__noemo	Non-tariff barrier is another mean to restrict imports .
__label__joy	It seems you've got everything done . Now I can finally stop worrying about it and get back to work .
__label__noemo	Sandy . Do you have a minute ?
__label__noemo	Aright . Thanks for the info . I gotta go to the library now .
__label__noemo	Yo , G.How are you getting along with your classmates in the English training school ?
__label__noemo	So what ? His father is in prison , not he .
__label__noemo	I haven't accepted the position yet and with the upcoming holiday I think it's the perfect chance to visit the city and take a good look at the company before deciding . If you have time I think we c
__label__noemo	When muslims pray , they face towards mecca .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . When's the next bus ?
__label__noemo	Not at all . No hidden fees or surcharges , it is a flat monthly rate .
__label__joy	A little bit expensive , but I will buy one . This is $ 25 , here you are .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , how do I get to Wall Street ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s quite convenient .
__label__noemo	Can we get off the plane ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to reserve a table for three this evening .
__label__noemo	According to the newspaper , the exchange rate is 1.85 dollars to the pound .
__label__anger	You are passing the buck . I'll be hanged if I ask you to go to the park with us .
__label__noemo	Glad to meet you , Mr Stewart . I'm the guide from Pacific Tour Agency . My name is Zhang Hua .
__label__noemo	Crossed cousin marriage is not allowed in China .
__label__joy	Perfect . Couldn't be better !
__label__noemo	Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me !
__label__noemo	I believe I would have better opportunities with a small but rapidly expanding company like yours .
__label__noemo	The closest garage . What's the charge ?
__label__noemo	That's true . I should make sure my wife and baby stay healthy during this time .
__label__noemo	Here's the latest model — Digital Barbie .
__label__noemo	All right , who should I send them to ?
__label__noemo	All I make is oatmeal , toast , and some orange juice .
__label__noemo	I made sure to be in line to see it the first day it came out .
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve been accepted !
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__joy	Okay.Thanks for your help .
__label__noemo	If I can do anything for you , don't hesitate to let me know .
__label__joy	I agree , I had lunch there last week .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__noemo	Dumplings .
__label__joy	Yes . The well-known Yellowstone Waterfall is formed when the Yellowstone Lake falls down into the Yellowstone Canyon .
__label__joy	She must have done a lot of work on it .
__label__noemo	I am looking for a growth opportunity , which I feel is not available at my current employer . In terms of skills , I am Microsoft certified in Windows XP and several other operating systems .
__label__noemo	Can you elaborate it more concretely ?
__label__noemo	Will I know the results right away ?
__label__noemo	yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good .
__label__noemo	I have been going to graduate school at USC .
__label__noemo	The Card doesn't actually give you discounts on beer.But it will give you discounts on certain club cover charges.So if you want to see your favorite band at Amy's or Cosmo's Club , you get a discount on the entrance fee .
__label__noemo	I ’ m at work right now . You can reach me at 905 675 9870 . Please call this number if you need me .
__label__noemo	I think the government can afford it . Besides , there are many advantages . Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement .
__label__noemo	Oh I ’ m learning very slowly . I think Chinese is more difficult than English .
__label__noemo	Sure do . I get a kick out of looking punk .
__label__noemo	Honey , just do it next time . Have you heard of the real art in the subway station in Russia ?
__label__surprise	What ? I was just having a friendly conversation with the lady here ...
__label__noemo	Hey there , you look a little lost . Are you new here ?
__label__noemo	What's her personality like ?
__label__noemo	It is necessary for you to walk on the street . Otherwise , it will be not good to wear high heeled shoes .
__label__noemo	You need to fill out a special form to apply for unemployment benefits .
__label__noemo	Los Angeles is in California . It's southeast of San Francisco .
__label__noemo	Much as we'd like to , but we've booked up already for that time .
__label__noemo	Yes . Then cross the road at the next traffic lights . The Peak Tram is straight ahead . You can't miss it .
__label__sadness	Something awful happened . We went to the Portobello Road , and someone stole my handbag .
__label__joy	That's a good idea . And in this way we will know how we spend our time and spare a lot of time to do other things .
__label__noemo	No , I ’ ll call the attendants at the gate . I will tell them you ’ re on your way .
__label__joy	I passed history test .
__label__noemo	May I have a look at your receipt ?
__label__noemo	You have no choice , so you'd better adjust your thoughts to be ready to learn anything at any time .
__label__noemo	Did you enjoy the meal ?
__label__noemo	Not that I know of . Why do you ask ?
__label__noemo	What kind of live bait are you using ? Worms or minnows ?
__label__noemo	She went to the store to buy some groceries . Would you like to leave a message ?
__label__noemo	How are you doing ?
__label__joy	The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ?
__label__noemo	Well , what if I told you the seminar is going to be held in Hawaii ? Does that perk your interest ?
__label__noemo	David , imagine meeting you here !
__label__noemo	Fine , I am putting you down for 9
__label__noemo	Actually , I've only got a two-seater . I'll have to go on my own .
__label__noemo	I need somebody to come over and fix my internet .
__label__noemo	Next left then right ? OK .
__label__noemo	Do you have any hats ?
__label__noemo	7880 Crofton Avenue , Building 40A , Room 304 .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry for spilling my drink on your rug .
__label__joy	Oh , moblogging is a combination of the word ' mobile ' and ' blogging ' . It's another form of blogging . Users can publish blog entries to the web from a mobile phone or other mobile devices .
__label__noemo	Hey Rachael , what's up ? How is your day ?
__label__noemo	I wish that I were good at the discus , but I could rarely throw it in the right direction ! I was awful . With the hurdles , I could never jump over them !
__label__noemo	I can't remember , but I've got the receipt somewhere.Would you like to see it ?
__label__noemo	I'll send a squad car .
__label__noemo	Hello , Sir , may I help you ?
__label__sadness	I hope so . But I'm always caught short .
__label__noemo	All right.Maybe next time I can go with you.Bye !
__label__joy	I love the dancing figures . I'll take this music box .
__label__noemo	You know , I'm about to graduate and I have to look for a job as soon as possible . But I haven ’ t the faintest idea of how to go about finding a job .
__label__noemo	I ’ d totally die if she turned me down .
__label__joy	Good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time .
__label__noemo	I will put you down for that time . Thank you for calling to reschedule .
__label__noemo	I see . He's usually here on Tuesday mornings ...
__label__noemo	After you .
__label__joy	Yes , great . I am happy you are coming .
__label__noemo	Yes , it was just when I was walking in the park . I saw some children with a newspaper .
__label__noemo	You will get that information in court .
__label__joy	I sure will . Thanks .
__label__noemo	I'd like to make an appointment with Dr.Cooper.Could you arrange it for me ?
__label__noemo	Good morning .
__label__noemo	Good luck with your life .
__label__noemo	Check out these wheels !
__label__noemo	She was a psycho , man . One time we were suppose to get together . I was waiting for her call , and when she finally called , she was screaming why I wasn't at her place .
__label__noemo	She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she ' s around .
__label__joy	Then tell me what's good about it .
__label__noemo	yes . And I've brought some documents along with me , too . Do you need to see my passport ?
__label__noemo	But you just got here . Can ’ t you stay a little longer and have some tea ?
__label__noemo	Of course , if necessary .
__label__noemo	Hmm Maybe you're right . But I can't stand all this green carpet here . And besides , I know how to paint . I will just cover everything with drop cloth . I won't get anything on the floor .
__label__noemo	Sure . How many copies do you need ?
__label__noemo	You are entitled to a company car . Have you seen it yet ?
__label__noemo	How much is this ?
__label__noemo	Henry , do you know how much we spent this month ?
__label__noemo	Yes Anthony , come on in . Have a seat .
__label__noemo	Generally speaking , Cantonese food is a bit light ; Shanghai food is rather oily ; and Hunan dishes are very spicy , having a strong and hot taste .
__label__noemo	Oh my lord . I haven't really started them .
__label__noemo	yes , I went there once last summer .
__label__noemo	Two of my sisters still live at home , even though they have already graduated from university and have good jobs . They enjoy spending their free time with my parents . I guess in that respect , I'm the black sheep of the family .
__label__noemo	I got a 4.0 in that class .
__label__joy	I ’ m so excited .
__label__joy	Oh , sure . Credit card is fine .
__label__noemo	No . You shouldn't drive like that .
__label__noemo	What dances do you like ?
__label__noemo	I won ’ t be able to fix the pipe until tomorrow .
__label__noemo	On the second floor .
__label__noemo	Where did you get your mobile ? It's really cute .
__label__noemo	Oh , what ’ s he like ?
__label__joy	That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play singsong . Perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
__label__noemo	how about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym .
__label__noemo	But we saved your parents so much money ...
__label__noemo	In that case , you are supposed to ask the caller to leave a message .
__label__noemo	Okay , I'll take it .
__label__noemo	No , our check-out time will still be 8: 30 tomorrow .
__label__noemo	I think bears are wonderful . Pandas are fantastic . I low the people who kill them for their fur .
__label__noemo	Please wait a moment . I'll check it in the computer . Thanks for your waiting . You've booked 10 standard rooms for trade negotiation for March 5th , 6th and 7th , is it correct ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m your wife , not a housewife . I have my own work .
__label__noemo	Well , here is the money .
__label__joy	I really enjoyed meeting with you .
__label__noemo	How are you , Kim ? I haven ’ t seen you around for a few days .
__label__noemo	Well , a 15 - inch Pro is $ 2,100 .
__label__noemo	It was 38 ° C this morning and it was 39 ° C just now .
__label__anger	No , don't , I don't want to see you anymore . Don't ever call me again .
__label__noemo	What do you like doing in your spare time ?
__label__noemo	How long does it take to cook meat on a barbecue ?
__label__noemo	Yet the Argentine attacker is worth a bet .
__label__noemo	Good afternoon , Mary . How's business ?
__label__noemo	I'll remember .
__label__noemo	Can you think of some other places where I may look for work ?
__label__noemo	You seem to be very hesitant about doing things .
__label__noemo	Definitely . Oh , do you have a reference letter ?
__label__noemo	May I see your passport please ?
__label__noemo	Considering our good relationship and our future business , we give you four percent . That's the best we can do . We can't go any further . What would you say to it ?
__label__joy	Thanks for your help .
__label__noemo	Daniel , I am not tall enough to reach the of the blackboard .
__label__noemo	I'll cook dinner for you .
__label__noemo	Because they are direct communication with another person , and there ’ s a time limit . This time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of English .
__label__noemo	You can reach me at 13661306917 .
__label__noemo	Do they have any children ?
__label__noemo	Yep . That way I can satisfy my craving for spicy food and you can eat hot pot without burning into flames .
__label__noemo	Yes . It's right here .
__label__joy	Look ! It fits you perfectly . It looks great on you and has your name on it .
__label__noemo	Positive 。
__label__noemo	Yeah , but he really puts blame on me .
__label__joy	I've seen it so many times in books , but I never imagined I'd get to see it in person .
__label__noemo	She will be 86 next month .
__label__joy	Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?
__label__joy	I feel that way , too . But all good things must come to an end , as they say .
__label__noemo	I'll make sure he receives the message .
__label__noemo	Oh . Henry . I haven't seen you in ages . Come in . Let me take your coat . How are you getting along ?
__label__noemo	It sounds that you have a high opinion of him .
__label__surprise	My goodness ! Are you OK ?
__label__noemo	Hello , John . How are you ?
__label__noemo	They must have practiced a lot . The perseverance has made them they are today .
__label__noemo	I want to have a look at the microwave ovens .
__label__surprise	Really ? He is so competent now .
__label__noemo	Alright this is a good one . What would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married ?
__label__noemo	No . These terms need to be amplified .
__label__noemo	Do you plan on voting ?
__label__joy	Good ideas .
__label__noemo	The most you will experience will be a dry cough but you probably won ’ t experience anything negative .
__label__noemo	Oh , let's see . . . About six .
__label__joy	It ’ s very kind of you to say so .
__label__noemo	How much do you want us to pay you ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me . I wonder if you could help me . I'm looking for the Oriental Pearl Theater .
__label__noemo	What was your major in school ?
__label__noemo	Wait a sec .
__label__noemo	Yes , I always have coffee in the morning .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	It's a good idea . But please be careful when you invest this time .
__label__noemo	When can I go to see him ?
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__joy	Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment .
__label__noemo	Driver , take me to the airport .
__label__noemo	Souvenirs ?
__label__noemo	Hello , miss . I would like to check out .
__label__noemo	And I'd like to have insurance just in case .
__label__noemo	Tell me about it .
__label__noemo	Tell me something about yourself and your past .
__label__noemo	What are you so excited about ?
__label__noemo	I hate this part of school .
__label__noemo	Yes . Quite good . Perhaps you're very interested in the social benefits .
__label__noemo	OK . OK . You'd better tell me what he does .
__label__joy	Would you like another beer ?
__label__noemo	OK , I will keep this position for you for one week .
__label__noemo	Please come to the front to have five minutes ’ free talk in English . Very well ! Whose turn is it to have a free talk ?
__label__noemo	This computer isn't working properly .
__label__noemo	If I may ask , are you happy with your salary ?
__label__noemo	Thank you . I want to continue to be able to recommend this hotel to others .
__label__sadness	Not bad.Li Hong , I am sorry that I can ’ t go to see Mrs.Brown with you tomorrow morning.My mother is ill . I must take care of her .
__label__noemo	Yes , of course .
__label__noemo	I can not belive that . It must be cooked up by someone .
__label__noemo	I guess using a computer has a great deal to do with human interaction . Getting in touch with each other must be more fun to your wife and my son than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .
__label__noemo	Oh , I haven ’ t noticed that before . Maybe I will try next time .
__label__noemo	If only I could join it !
__label__noemo	I've already given you a discount of 20 % off of our normally charge . If I go any lower , we'll have loss on this project . I really want to work with you on this . But we've already gone as low as we can go .
__label__surprise	You think he might stay even longer ? !
__label__joy	What is the special local product ?
__label__joy	Sure . But the work you did was really exceptional ! You definitely deserved it !
__label__noemo	But if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ?
__label__surprise	Why ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ?
__label__noemo	Of course . Just give me your fax number .
__label__noemo	Yes . I had a bad traffic accident.Look , my car looks like a squashed coke can .
__label__noemo	Yes . Shall I get one for you ? Just push the button over there if you need anything .
__label__noemo	Can I help you , sir ?
__label__joy	That's right . OK , let's move on .
__label__noemo	That's no problem . Which currency would you like to buy ?
__label__noemo	I have had some really horrible headaches lately .
__label__noemo	What do you think of the project ?
__label__joy	I am rejoiced to tell you that you are employed .
__label__noemo	I have plenty of time to do this . I promise you it won't be a problem for me .
__label__noemo	I got Jacob . Any ideas what to get him ?
__label__noemo	Hi , John .
__label__noemo	I hope so .
__label__noemo	Your address , please .
__label__joy	No , that's all . Thanks .
__label__noemo	Kyoto is lovely . It's full of beautiful old temples and gardens.It ' s a very historic city .
__label__noemo	Give him a chance .
__label__noemo	My domicile is Beijing .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t take that tone with me . Do you have an invoice for these items ?
__label__noemo	I feel they all talk and behave in a different way .
__label__noemo	I'm planning to go to graduate school , but I also want to find a job . Otherwise , I'll have nowhere to go if I fail the entrance exam .
__label__noemo	Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	The changes are usually not that dramatic . We just got some pictures of the latest fashion . Would you like to take a look ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , it sounds like it's going to be the best party of the year .
__label__noemo	Well , I mean.We always do the same thing.There ' s no variety in our lives .
__label__noemo	Right here . Me and my PC . Home sweet home .
__label__joy	That ’ s a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense .
__label__noemo	I need five single rooms in October . How much of a discount can I get ?
__label__noemo	Sorry to keep you waiting , Miss . I'll have a dresser Mr.Li is just finish with a client in a moment or two . Would you have a shampoo first ? I'll get it on for you .
__label__sadness	Hello , Kevin . I hate to do this , but I have to cancel our appointment .
__label__noemo	maybe he should really something about eating etiquette .
__label__noemo	That ’ s about all I can spare , Karen . What do you need ?
__label__joy	Luckily , his company has a position available here , so he ’ s going to see if he can get relocated .
__label__joy	No , but I'd really like to .
__label__noemo	I will take part in the finals soon .
__label__noemo	And how much is the deposit ?
__label__noemo	I'm going to Bihai Park.Is this the right bus , please ?
__label__noemo	It will for me . Then I can do all the things I want to do .
__label__noemo	World Airlines , Flight 201 .
__label__noemo	I'm not in the mood .
__label__noemo	Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ’ t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
__label__noemo	I think I'm going to keep it as a monument to what I've learned about money .
__label__noemo	Something wrong ?
__label__joy	That's really exciting . How many months are you pregnant ?
__label__noemo	Maybe nowadays people hold different opinions on healthy diet .
__label__noemo	afterwards , we can do the washing up together . Everything will be finished within an hour . Your friend Keith is really funny . I liked his magic tricks .
__label__noemo	By all means .
__label__noemo	What are you doing in Australia ?
__label__noemo	I think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment , and the others can go under the seat .
__label__noemo	Really ? Ugh ... Is there any difference ?
__label__noemo	Is the service charged ?
__label__noemo	Yes . How are the Spanish classes going ?
__label__noemo	My plans are to be there April 14th to the 17th .
__label__noemo	May I help you , sir ?
__label__joy	Sure , I'll be back in a minute .
__label__noemo	May I please speak to Tom ?
__label__noemo	It feels all right . But if it were a darker color , I will like it better .
__label__noemo	Now we have settled the terms of payment . Is it possible to effect shipment during September ?
__label__joy	You bet . I wouldn ’ t miss it !
__label__noemo	Not too long . It should take about ten mins by taxi .
__label__noemo	Where are you going now ?
__label__noemo	At least 20 days .
__label__noemo	It's 3 nights a week , Monday , Tuesday and Thursday .
__label__noemo	what do you do when you see a homeless person on the streets begging for money ?
__label__noemo	But let me tell you , you're doing just fine . I couldn't do half as well as you do when I was learning German.By the way , how long have you been learning English ?
__label__noemo	That seems a little impolite in such a restaurant .
__label__noemo	Bill , where are we going to stay tonight ?
__label__noemo	Well , ' Terminator ' is a really great action movie , and I like action movies because they're exciting .
__label__noemo	I watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . It was called “ unusual plants ” and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features .
__label__noemo	I'd like a banker's draft please . It's not really urgent .
__label__noemo	Do you have a registration card ?
__label__joy	You are welcome !
__label__noemo	The dress is made on your measurement .
__label__noemo	How much would you like to transfer ?
__label__noemo	My throat is really dry .
__label__noemo	So so .
__label__joy	"No , just a small one.Next Let's sing "" Happy Birthday "" to Mary ."
__label__noemo	That would be our Saver's Plus account .
__label__noemo	Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror .
__label__noemo	I have a scholarship from my government for four years . How about you ?
__label__noemo	Just pass the gym and it's the first door on your left . Were you aware that you can also turn in your old textbooks for money ?
__label__noemo	Yes , but do you think there is eternal love in the world ?
__label__surprise	Wow ! You really like fruit , huh ? You've already had 3 plates !
__label__noemo	Allow me to apologize . I'll give you another room right now , and a full refund for tonight .
__label__noemo	Do you think you'll ever get a divorce again ?
__label__noemo	I understand that . But I think maybe it's not a date . You are taking the matter too much to heart .
__label__noemo	Do you have the sensation of ants crawling over the painful part ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s just nerves . Just play the right hand for now . One two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . Good , good . Don ’ t forget the accidentals ! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp b
__label__noemo	We spend a lot of money to make sure that our quality is much better . We don ’ t sacrifice quality for quick profits .
__label__noemo	What bills are included in the rent ?
__label__noemo	What are you talking about ?
__label__noemo	I'm sure there'll be canned ! And there also might be some legal consequences .
__label__noemo	The tap is always driving . I can't sleep well .
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	The reading on the kilometer is 12 $ .
__label__noemo	OK . How much is the deposit ?
__label__noemo	Got it .
__label__joy	I'm Steven , your neighbour .
__label__noemo	How ? By drinking ?
__label__noemo	Just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview .
__label__joy	Me too . Have a great day .
__label__noemo	Hello , Lucy .
__label__noemo	Sometimes it's wise to be direct with people . Come on , just tell me . Don't beat around the bush , please !
__label__surprise	Really ? You must be ...
__label__noemo	Tell me what the problem is .
__label__noemo	That's a good idea . Do you want some more coffee ?
__label__noemo	No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them .
__label__noemo	The westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated . The Chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate . I assume it is less complicated , right ?
__label__noemo	Unfortunately , I'm leaving town rather unexpectedly , and I may be gone for several days .
__label__joy	Thank you , I've learned so much from you .
__label__noemo	I've come in to give you the documents under the L / C we opened , the new one . This lot are from Singapore , a new customer .
__label__noemo	Yeah , everyday . And there ’ s only one choice . All the other buses are going the other direction .
__label__noemo	Don't you think you would miss having other people around ?
__label__noemo	I don't like the merry-go-round .
__label__noemo	What are all the symptoms ?
__label__noemo	What kind of stamps do you want ?
__label__noemo	I know you can do it .
__label__noemo	They should . This holiday is about remembering our war dead . But people these days think it's just a holiday for summer sales and cookouts !
__label__noemo	Does 7 o'clock suit you ?
__label__joy	Do you like flowers ?
__label__noemo	14 hours .
__label__noemo	I see . Could you make an exception and accept D / A or D / P ?
__label__noemo	I hate to tell you this , but they are nothing but sob stories .
__label__noemo	Do you think a private vehicle might be more to your liking ?
__label__noemo	I have to pay my credit bill too . If I don ’ t pay it soon , the credit card company will charge me interest .
__label__sadness	Excuse me , would you tell me how to return to Hilton Hotel . I'm afraid I lost my way .
__label__noemo	Yes , what is it , William ?
__label__joy	Good.Let ' s go now .
__label__noemo	Come on . It is worth waiting . Their cheese burgers are really popular . Once you have it , you will love it .
__label__noemo	Right now .
__label__noemo	Front desk . May I help you ?
__label__joy	It looks more like a toy , or a cool briefcase !
__label__noemo	It all sounds so relaxing . I wish I could get away to the beach like that .
__label__noemo	Hello , Kate ! How are you doing ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry registration has closed .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	I'm sure the output of your production will increase a lot .

__label__noemo	For instance ?
__label__joy	How about going to dance ? There is a very good nightclub nearby .
__label__noemo	All right . Here it is .
__label__noemo	On and off , for quite a few years .
__label__noemo	Do you have anything else I can have instead ?
__label__noemo	Wouldn't you like some more chicken ?
__label__noemo	Do you know any places ?

__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I want to get a better job .
__label__joy	I feel that he is very intelligent .
__label__noemo	When crossing the road you must always pay attention to what's around you .
__label__noemo	I don't really feel too well yet .
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry , Melissa . I really can ’ t today . I ’ Ve just got too much going on . Maybe tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Fill in the slip , stating the exact amount you wish to withdraw , please .
__label__noemo	Would a slight decrease in pay be worth it for a new opportunity for growth ?
__label__noemo	Nonsmoking . Now , is a queen-size bed okay ?
__label__noemo	Can you play a musical instrument ? If you can , he might ask you to join the band .

__label__surprise	Wow ! You look like a drowned rat ! Didn't you know there is a thunder-storm today ?
__label__noemo	Would you cash these travelers ' checks , please ?
__label__joy	Good morning golf aficionados ! My name is Rick Fields , and you guessed it , I am here with my main man , Bob Copeland .
__label__noemo	Who do you think is going to get the Oscar for best actor ?
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	Mostly in the city's swimming pool . But on occasion , I go to the beach with friends . Well , what do you do at leisure ?
__label__noemo	I think so , but how should we write it ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , I noticed . She must be really loaded .
__label__noemo	Well , he ’ s got dark hair and brown eyes .
__label__noemo	Are you sure you ’ re alright . You look a bit worry today ? Is anything wrong ?
__label__joy	Where ’ s that ? Oh , I know ! Madame Tussaud ’ s the waxworks museum .
__label__noemo	Speaking .
__label__noemo	Well , I missed several buses .
__label__noemo	Cut what out I ’ m not doing anything .
__label__noemo	I am very sorry to hear that you ’ Ve been having so many problems .
__label__noemo	Yes , I used to work as an assistant lawyer for Tienda Law Office .
__label__noemo	Is that a Danish machine ? The name looks Danish .
__label__noemo	I'm thirsty . Pull over to that store , I'll buy some drinks .
__label__noemo	What was the weather like in New York ?
__label__noemo	Yeah . He's a private eye now .
__label__noemo	Didn't you say you knew where to get off the bus ?
__label__noemo	Well , can you explain it to me ?
__label__noemo	Don ’ t give me your attitude . Please tell me .
__label__noemo	Believe it or not , tea is the most popular beverage in the world after water .
__label__noemo	The price seems acceptable . Can you supply the bedsheets now if we order some ?
__label__noemo	What made you think that she wasn't very confident ?
__label__noemo	Oh , did you ?
__label__noemo	Let's come to an agreement to salary .
__label__noemo	You don't look very happy in that picture .
__label__noemo	Joanna , I will go to the outlet center . You wanna go with me ?
__label__noemo	Good afternoon ! Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	I'd like that . Alright , put on this apron first .
__label__noemo	Hi , Sandra . how was your weekend ?
__label__surprise	You don ’ t know ? The company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones .
__label__noemo	Not for me . It is already late . I can not fall asleep after drinking coffee this late .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t know if I told you or not , but I decided to start my own business .
__label__noemo	That sounds like a good place to take a date . Can you make a reservation for me ?
__label__joy	It ’ s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
__label__noemo	Oh , China does have been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history .
__label__noemo	Right here , please .
__label__noemo	Ben cancelled his trip .
__label__noemo	Is that very likely in England ?
__label__noemo	Are you looking for an apartment ?
__label__joy	That's great news , Jeremy . Congratulations ! Anyway , I must get back , but give my regards to your wife Monica .
__label__noemo	I'm very sorry , sir . I'll bring you a cloth immediately .

__label__noemo	That'll be $ 200 , sir .
__label__noemo	Julia , the apartment I looked at today is pretty decent-around 120 square meters .
__label__noemo	Don't lose this receipt , because insurance companies are very difficult about helping when they don't have the right paperwork .
__label__noemo	For example ?
__label__surprise	Are you ? I thought you had something to drink at her home .
__label__noemo	We are more interested in finding someone who is alert and quick at figures . Do you like meeting the public ?
__label__noemo	I bet it's May 5th .

__label__joy	Yes , I liked it , too . Did you like the acting ?
__label__noemo	So it has attracted more and more customers these days .
__label__noemo	Would you like to go to the natural history museum with me ?
__label__noemo	Could I do that right now , please ?
__label__noemo	Yeah . I just can't find it anywhere .
__label__noemo	You're just jealous .
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? That sounds interesting , what kinds of book do you publish ?
__label__noemo	What's so special today ?
__label__noemo	Are you referring to KC getting her head stuck in the pant leg ?
__label__noemo	Sure . Anything else ?
__label__joy	That's great . Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Yes . Thank you .

__label__noemo	Well , what's the price of this route ?
__label__noemo	Why ? They have everything here .
__label__noemo	That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs .
__label__noemo	Could I have one for tomorrow morning ?
__label__noemo	Still , you should not let down your guard . Some details should be paid attention to .
__label__noemo	I'll be happy to try .
__label__noemo	That's correct .
__label__noemo	Actually , the factory is located in Scotland .
__label__joy	Yeah , I guess that's a typical example of ' when in Rome , do as the Romans do . '
__label__joy	Delicious ! Did you make this chocolate cake yourself , Fred ?
__label__noemo	I need to go to the ATM .
__label__noemo	Yeah , these programs are gradually losing their appeal .
__label__noemo	Which do you prefer , the linen one , the figured dacron or the brocade ?
__label__noemo	You can take one tonic or hand cream .
__label__noemo	Then go climbing with me , Daddy . Mountain climbing can build your muscles like Popeyes .
__label__noemo	Whoa , that ’ s a lot of cash ! Let ’ s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing .
__label__noemo	I think our smoked fish will be to your taste .
__label__noemo	Dark , please .
__label__noemo	I want to know whether you can handle the matters of registered permanent residence .
__label__noemo	Can you understand your Spanish teacher ?
__label__noemo	I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .
__label__noemo	You'll see one at the corner on your right .
__label__noemo	But the direction book says I will get one-year warranty .
__label__joy	It's my pleasure .
__label__noemo	That ’ s one hundred and forty .
__label__noemo	Why did you stay home today ?
__label__noemo	Concerning our financial position , credit standing and trade reputation , you may refer to our bank.or to our local chamber of commerce or inquiry agencies .
__label__joy	Excellent . Come in please . The washing machine is in the bathroom upstairs . It keeps breaking down .
__label__noemo	Hello . Is Steve there ?
__label__noemo	OK , here are the clothes .
__label__joy	Yes , we do . What a great taste you have ! But we only have one left in stock .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	Can you make it any cheaper ?
__label__noemo	You're going to need your ID to pay the ticket .
__label__noemo	That's true dedication . I'm impressed . When is it due ?
__label__noemo	When do you want to move in ?
__label__noemo	No , no , no , not at all.It ' s just that I've been looking forward to meeting you .
__label__noemo	We still prefer French dressing .
__label__noemo	Look at this girl's gray dress .
__label__noemo	Yes . He was released from hospital yesterday evening . The other man could be there for weeks .
__label__noemo	Certainly , I ’ ll make an appointment for you with Mr . Jordan of the Egypt National Native Produce and Animal By-products Import and Export Corporation .
__label__noemo	At 2 PM , give a presentation here with the press . At four o ’ clock sharp , have dinner with Mr . Smith , manager of NCC .
__label__noemo	Where are you from ?
__label__noemo	Make sure that you understand the company . Do you understand what it is that they do ?
__label__noemo	Yes , sir . We usually serve soya-bean milk and jellied beancurd . Which one do you prefer , sir ? A
__label__anger	What a terrible house !
__label__noemo	That means it's developing very fast .
__label__noemo	Please make sure to fasten your seat belt . We are to take off .
__label__noemo	What kind do you plan on making ?
__label__noemo	Oh , no problem . Here's the lid that comes with the pan .
__label__noemo	Excuse me Miao Li . Could you tell me who Jackie Chan is ?
__label__noemo	I had no idea – and look at these charges for movies !
__label__noemo	Then the M-Zone will be suitable .
__label__noemo	Why did you leave your last position ?
__label__noemo	Yes , yes , I want to take you to dinner .
__label__noemo	That'll be $ 70 , please . Will you be paying by cash or charge ?
__label__noemo	Yes , go down the fifth street . You won't miss it .
__label__noemo	I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! Can you come here for a sec ? I need your help .
__label__noemo	You know , the basics . A rake , shovel , spade and a hoe .
__label__noemo	A Mac is a very popular brand .
__label__noemo	Do you accept traveler's checks ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it is .
__label__noemo	What do you like to drink ?
__label__noemo	The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same .
__label__noemo	I would like to make a collect call to Taipei , Taiwan , please .
__label__noemo	Is there any minimum for the first deposit ?
__label__noemo	Well , I'd like some legal advice . Jane and I are thinking of incorporating . So Want to find out what sort of legal procedure one follows in forming a corporation .
__label__anger	But have 2 - hour journey .
__label__surprise	Really ? That's wonderful !
__label__noemo	I hear many teenagers will spend hours and hours sitting at computers . And they don't care about their own health at all . How about you ?
__label__noemo	The woman was beaten again . Why didn ’ t she call the police .
__label__noemo	How may I help you ?
__label__joy	Hey , David . Would you like some drinks ?
__label__noemo	I want to buy some running shoes . Maybe New Balance .
__label__noemo	Thanks for letting me know .
__label__noemo	You know . Tests like ” how jealous are you ? ” and “ are you a fashion victim ? ”
__label__noemo	leo , I really think you ’ re beating around the bush with this guy . I know he used to be your best friend in college , but I really think it ’ s time to lay down the law .
__label__noemo	Do I have to get up now ?
__label__noemo	Tell me about it ! We drank everything in the bar !
__label__joy	At least more than 100 years old .
__label__noemo	Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ?
__label__noemo	I beg your pardon ?
__label__noemo	To show that you have understood what is said , you can nod or ask simple questions at the right time .
__label__noemo	Oh , how awful ! May I have a look at the invoice ?
__label__joy	How can we get there ?
__label__noemo	I don ’ t try to lead people . I ’ d rather cooperate with everybody , and get the job done by working together .
__label__noemo	I have just checked in this afternoon . I am wondering what shall I do if I want to have some clothes washed .
__label__noemo	Good .
__label__noemo	good morning .
__label__noemo	What a shame . Why didn't you take a sleeping pill ?
__label__fear	Now I know that something bad is up !
__label__noemo	All right.Got it .
__label__surprise	Why ? You said I was hot when smoking .
__label__noemo	You knew Brain Locker ?
__label__noemo	I locked it when I left though .
__label__noemo	August 1st .
__label__noemo	Does the cafeteria sell a lot of different food ?
__label__noemo	I prefer summer , especially the summer evenings . When the sun comes down , it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . After a rain shower , the smell of the air is refreshing . It is also a best reason for ice-cream .
__label__noemo	OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan .
__label__noemo	Yes . I'd like to .
__label__noemo	It depends on the time of year . At peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch . We also contract out certain services all year round , for example , cleaning . We run a very tight operation !
__label__noemo	All right .
__label__fear	This can ’ t wait ! I need your help now !
__label__noemo	Nice to meet you , too . Miss Li . please have a seat . I am Peter Smith , the General Manager .
__label__noemo	I am sorry , could you repeat it please ?
__label__noemo	You're got a point there.But do you think he's a little absent-minded ?
__label__noemo	This is Peter Kaufman .
__label__noemo	Be relaxed . She is familiar with the area .
__label__noemo	There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table .
__label__noemo	Me , too . I'm always in low spirits when it rains . Are you going out tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	And then she made the deal with MicroPower . Vince wanted to sell for fifteen million ...
__label__noemo	Yeah . But I ...
__label__noemo	Fortunately , she's not seriously injured .
__label__joy	Now we have a two-year-old boy . We're very happy that he's healthy and smart .
__label__noemo	Is he an easy grader ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I can also learn about the traffic condition through it .
__label__joy	How about tango ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to talk with you again about what happened .
__label__noemo	Thank you very much . And do you have any proof of the financial support for the three years ?
__label__noemo	I guess I'm just a little nervous . I'm giving everything I have to invoking , and ...
__label__noemo	Would you like me to tell you where I got mine .
__label__noemo	I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . Who do you think will win ?
__label__noemo	What do you recommend ?
__label__joy	That's right . For seventy-five million . So how are you ?
__label__noemo	How much are they ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me . I am looking for a book called Little Women , but I can't find it anywhere .
__label__noemo	ok ... I'm going to have to skip over this section . It's girl-talk .
__label__noemo	I think I can handle it by myself .
__label__joy	I think it's beautiful . I want to hang it in the living room .
__label__noemo	Mine was ok , except that no one in my class speaks English . I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester .
__label__noemo	I thought you had been to Australia too .
__label__noemo	Then I suggest you go to K-Mart or Wal-Mart .
__label__surprise	Forgotten about it ? How could you ?
__label__noemo	The thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . Russia and Canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
__label__noemo	Will you be getting more in .
__label__noemo	Well , I'd like to , but I am not sure I have time .
__label__noemo	Oh dear . That ’ s terrible . What was in your wallet ?
__label__noemo	That can be easily done . Is there anything else ?
__label__noemo	I am doing great ! Thank you for asking , Joe .
__label__joy	That's great . We can also take the dragon kite with us . After the picnic , we can fly it .
__label__noemo	Yes , we are a small family business .
__label__noemo	I know.But I'd like to try.Look , here are some advertisements that I've cut out .
__label__noemo	I want to pick up my parcels .
__label__noemo	Our team played hard and won .
__label__noemo	Oh , my dear lady , take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him .
__label__noemo	Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
__label__noemo	Yeah , sure . Let's go .
__label__noemo	Yes . This is Janet Smith . I ’ d like to make an appointment with Dr . Mustn as soon as possible .
__label__joy	it ’ s great ! I ’ Ve learned a lot form reading it .
__label__noemo	My wife and I earned one hundred and fifty thousand dollars last year .
__label__noemo	Why should we run after the fashion ?
__label__noemo	Do I have to take gym ?
__label__noemo	Can I get you something , coffee , tea ?
__label__noemo	Hey , Ted . What are you up to this Friday ?
__label__noemo	What did the doctor say ?
__label__noemo	No . Wendy is being cremated . She always talked about how she didn ’ t want to be buried . I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean .
__label__anger	If there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude .
__label__noemo	Mary , my friend recommend me for a job to work in a company , and I feel it's great .
__label__noemo	Great ! When can your technicians come to our factory ?
__label__noemo	no , should I have ?
__label__noemo	I want to become a professor , a lawyer , an editor , a civil servant ...
__label__surprise	That's very unbelievable . Is it fake ?
__label__noemo	This is a small town , and we like to be neighborly . We know everyone who lives around here .
__label__noemo	OK , sir . I'll do my best .
__label__noemo	You can go to any branch of IBA and request the Emergency Assistance Service . Everything will be taken care of , there's no need to worry .
__label__sadness	Sorry . The road is too crowded .
__label__anger	I don ’ t think you do.If you did , I ’ d have a car.See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them .
__label__noemo	Well , I will think it over .
__label__noemo	On , darn . The grocery store is closed .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , sir . Can I help you ?
__label__anger	Come on mom . I'm your A ! Wait till the guys hear about this !
__label__noemo	Well , come over and talk to me then .
__label__noemo	Sure , follow me .
__label__noemo	She wears her heart on her sleeve .
__label__joy	OK . Let me help you to hold the drink .
__label__noemo	In cash , please . Here you are .
__label__noemo	I have , actually ; I ’ Ve always wanted to build my dream home myself .
__label__noemo	Er ... Hum ... Got it .
__label__joy	That's OK . I'm awake now .
__label__noemo	Yes , I want to go out . Would you like to come ?
__label__noemo	Or what only we are able to give them .
__label__noemo	It ’ s the only way to preserve her reputation .
__label__noemo	I still need to take English 201 , but I really don't like writing .
__label__joy	Sounds like a plan . Let's meet in front of Tower Records at 12:00 .
__label__noemo	Do you know much about computers ?
__label__joy	This is gonna be a great barbecue !
__label__noemo	November this year .
__label__noemo	It ’ s 8357688 8 .
__label__noemo	Wait a moment . I will calculate it for you . Your bill comes to $ 36 .
__label__noemo	So , what's on the menu for dinner tonight ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it really is . After having vegetarian diet . I have much more energy , I need less sleep , I feel calmer . I can maintain an ideal body weight without worrying about how much I eat and I can think more clearly .
__label__noemo	I'm paid on a salary .
__label__noemo	Ms . : With a hall pass , you can go to the ladies ' room or wherever you need to go during class time .
__label__joy	Yes , my friends like to get along with me well .
__label__noemo	No , thank you .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	What examinations ?
__label__noemo	OK.Here you are .

__label__noemo	Noirin , N-O-I-R-I-N , it's an Irish name .
__label__joy	That's great , exactly what I need to know . Thanks .
__label__noemo	I am not certain about that .
__label__noemo	No , thanks . Please bring us the bill .
__label__noemo	Exactly .
__label__noemo	Outlets give good deals .
__label__noemo	Hello ?
__label__noemo	Do you want some stuffed bun ? It's delicious , too .
__label__noemo	I applied for the job online .
__label__noemo	Where ? On the road ?
__label__noemo	May I serve your dishes now ?
__label__noemo	I'm going to help him .
__label__noemo	That was the only thing that I saw wrong with the apartment .
__label__noemo	let's take the bus .
__label__noemo	I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read , you can .
__label__noemo	Plenty.We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
__label__noemo	If you want to speed up your system , you ’ Ve got to clean it up first .
__label__noemo	So you have all the news on broadcast ?
__label__noemo	It's as plain as the nose on your face . They're dating each other .
__label__noemo	callous is a great Internet-based placement service that is available to you .
__label__noemo	Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb .
__label__noemo	Is it expensive ?
__label__joy	Surely , of course .
__label__noemo	Today is Saturday , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	Yes , going abroad to join the exhibition will cost much . But does it have any disadvantages ?
__label__sadness	No , I ’ m afraid not .
__label__joy	Simon , may I introduce you to Linda ? You don ’ t know each other , do you ?
__label__noemo	May I have the menu , please ?
__label__noemo	What do you do , Susan ?
__label__noemo	Well , it's listed on the electronic board on the left . We cash it at present traveler's check buying rate .
__label__noemo	No , they've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
__label__noemo	Yes , I have a three-year-old son .
__label__noemo	maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much !
__label__noemo	Of course . Please sit down . How can I help you ?
__label__joy	Let's get together this weekend .
__label__noemo	How to maintain a high standard of nursing ?
__label__noemo	I would love to join you on a hike . Could I maybe bring a picnic lunch for us to eat on the trail ?

__label__noemo	Any other ideas ?
__label__noemo	Hamburger Heaven .
__label__noemo	You ’ re kidding . We ’ ll never make it across in one piece ! Let ’ s cross at the light .
__label__noemo	I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children .
__label__noemo	I wish I was free that night . I'm kind of mad that I didn't go .
__label__noemo	I'd like a coke .
__label__noemo	We have reservations for two at your restaurant tonight .
__label__noemo	well , he'll definitely lose his license , pay a fine , and maybe even spend some time in jail .
__label__noemo	I'm in the mood for a Californian .
__label__noemo	Not at all , but you get what you pay for .
__label__noemo	Hi . I'm looking for a gift for my niece .
__label__noemo	I can ’ t attend the meeting in Washington . I ’ Ve proposed you as the most able substitute .
__label__noemo	Hello , this is the admissions office . Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	I appreciate it . It is related to company image .
__label__noemo	I do all the cooking .
__label__noemo	How about the Japanese ones ?
__label__noemo	What's the matter ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I would . I need to buy a textbook for my course and , as you know , I love browsing through the latest paperbacks .
__label__noemo	I expect to be paid according to my abilities .
__label__noemo	Hello , Marsha . I'm great and you ?
__label__noemo	It certainly is . But to tell you the truth , the room is so large that I can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
__label__noemo	Yeah , why not . Do you have all the ingredients ?
__label__noemo	Medicine .
__label__joy	My gosh ! How romantic ! When's the big day ?
__label__noemo	The pipe has been leaking for a couple days .
__label__noemo	No , I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't .
__label__noemo	What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ?
__label__noemo	Bo , of course not . He is still single .
__label__noemo	no , because I didn't know what I wanted to do .
__label__noemo	Come to think of it , you should get out your English books and catch up on your reading assignments .
__label__noemo	I see . Thank you .
__label__noemo	No . But it is said the welfare in Canada is very good .
__label__noemo	I hope to make 4,000 yuan a month for supporting my family .
__label__noemo	Ha , ha , ha ! Yes , I guess I deserved that . Let me explain , okay ?
__label__noemo	That's fine . Thanks . Enjoy your trip .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t actually know him .
__label__noemo	You heard who won the election , didn ’ t you ?
__label__noemo	You can get dressed as soon as the film is processed . We will be all done here .
__label__joy	All right . That sounds fair .
__label__noemo	Exactly . Then each individual has the chance to diversify their portfolio over many different areas , it doesn't have to be stocks . And , we provide a Professional Fund Manager , so you know your investment will be safe with us .
__label__noemo	What did you usually do as a head nurse ?
__label__noemo	Not at all . I think the tattoos are so cool and chic .
__label__joy	C U here , honey .
__label__noemo	Do you think of television though as a great time-waster ?
__label__noemo	Can we walk there ?
__label__noemo	sure . Every cloud has its silver lining . Just try .
__label__joy	It's very kind of you . I really don't know how I can thank you enough .
__label__noemo	Here we are on the train .
__label__anger	And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ?
__label__noemo	Yes , you need the traveler ’ s check but you needn ’ t get any foreign currency . You can have my US Dollars , I don ’ t need them .
__label__noemo	Yes , I watched United play Chelsea . What a fierce battle ! allay were engaged in intensive pressing and tackling in midfield . Well , it was not like a normal English League match .
__label__noemo	No , I haven't began my preparations .
__label__noemo	Of course . Just a minute ; I ’ ll get her .
__label__noemo	What ? You have been in love for six years , haven ’ t you ?
__label__joy	Good luck . I hope someone can help you .
__label__noemo	Anne , would you please come in for a while ? Please also bring along the minutes of yesterday's management meeting .
__label__joy	Bingo !
__label__noemo	The soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything . And it would need to be protected from the UV radiation .
__label__fear	Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do !
__label__surprise	So you put your watch back ten minutes every day ?
__label__joy	That makes sense . I think I'll do that . Thanks for all the help .
__label__noemo	Yes , it's so popular that it's sold out as soon as it reaches the bookstores .
__label__noemo	In about 25 minutes .
__label__noemo	Oh right ... you know , my friend Eric is a DJ . Maybe he would like to play with us .
__label__noemo	You seem to have a large gullibility line . You believe everything that you're told .
__label__noemo	Oh my god ! It's 10:00 pm . I have to go .
__label__noemo	I might . Vince knows he needs to keep me happy .
__label__noemo	Have you seen that house ?
__label__noemo	Why do people eat rice cakes on that day ?
__label__surprise	Oh , aren't you afraid ?
__label__noemo	I have no idea .
__label__joy	Bill , Happy Halloween !
__label__noemo	I had a pretty strict upbringing , and my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me .
__label__noemo	I'm really sorry , but I seem to have misplaced your towel .
__label__noemo	Let ’ s see . We spent $ 700 dollars for our home loan payment , $ 400 on groceries , $ 75 on utilities , $ 250 on gasoline , $ 100 on books , and $ 300 on entertainment last month .
__label__noemo	I'm sure you'll do well . Did you study hard ?
__label__joy	Congratulations on your promotion .
__label__noemo	You are sort of romantic .
__label__noemo	I totally understand .
__label__noemo	That's good . Is there anything else ?
__label__noemo	How much will the three pounds of chicken cost altogether ?
__label__noemo	I put in two quarters for a coke , but nothing came out of the machine .
__label__noemo	Am I late for the party ? Looks everyone is already here . Hope I didn ’ t miss something interesting .
__label__disgust	Not very long from the looks of it !
__label__noemo	They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage haj .
__label__noemo	Would you agree that the service is fast ?
__label__noemo	Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment .
__label__anger	I have to get to Chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights ?
__label__noemo	I see . Can you weigh them for me , please ?
__label__noemo	That's all . Come here a week later and get your ID card .
__label__noemo	Wow , the cheer-section is coming . The music is so fantastic .
__label__joy	It's just you !
__label__surprise	What ? Oh , what we live ! Thank you very much for your help , miss .
__label__noemo	No , I'm not hungry .
__label__noemo	What happened to my cup ?
__label__noemo	Yes , It has . It went off 30 minutes ago .
__label__joy	Yes , I just bought new car , I drive to work everyday !
__label__joy	Good-bye . Remember to look me up if you're ever in Washington .
__label__noemo	Good , I hope you'll make sure that it won't happen again .
__label__noemo	I think they're $ 130 .
__label__noemo	Yeah . How many tickets remain ?
__label__noemo	Let's go on the computer to see what's up . Do you think you are doing well ?
__label__noemo	Let's bygones be bygones , start saving right now .
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__noemo	How do you get along with your boss ?
__label__joy	Great ! Work is really busy now , but it's fun .
__label__noemo	It's a good thing that I have choices here . Can you tell me about the one on Saturday ?
__label__noemo	My employer . Can you come in to the office tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	No , but my husband smokes twenty or more a day .
__label__noemo	But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I ’ m nearly 17 .
__label__noemo	What kind ?
__label__noemo	Not really , i would consider it easy .
__label__noemo	Oh , please don't call me sir . Just call me Jason .
__label__noemo	How are you doing , Madam ? My name is During . I am coming to your company for an interview as requested .
__label__noemo	I ’ d love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now .
__label__noemo	Perhaps that had something to do with it .
__label__joy	It's made in China . The quality is excellent .
__label__noemo	Are you ready to order , sir ?
__label__noemo	It was . Let's stick with the regular choices today , though .
__label__noemo	you ’ ll see the national bank near the war memorial . It ’ s a big building and you ’ ll see a big sign on the front of the building .
__label__noemo	How is the condition ? How old is it ?
__label__noemo	Yeah . Mixed marriage is tempting but full of culture shock .
__label__noemo	Please keep calm . I know the pain isn ’ t what flesh and blood can stand . But be brave .
__label__noemo	Me , too . I think he ’ s really a shoulder to cry on .
__label__noemo	What are you thinking of getting ?
__label__joy	Then I'll walk.Many thanks .
__label__noemo	You are quite busy every day .
__label__noemo	Ah , it ’ s hard to say .
__label__noemo	Well , I ’ m doing okay . And how about yourself ?
__label__noemo	Well , his son had an accident and Bill doesn ’ t have health insurance . This really got me thinking , and I wondered if we shouldn ’ t look into a couple of different HMO ’ s .
__label__noemo	Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ?
__label__noemo	It was ?
__label__noemo	Have you used any hotel services this morning ?
__label__noemo	According to the book , it is . I ’ Ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . Look at the building . From the air , it looks like a square with a semi-circle attached to each of its four sides . What
__label__joy	this is supposed to be your vacation ; we'd like you to just relax .
__label__noemo	Where did the break-in happen ?
__label__noemo	Maybe it can take effect .
__label__joy	that ’ s all right .
__label__noemo	But it ’ s Friday today . This road is always jam packed during the weekend , isn ’ t it ?
__label__noemo	Does everyone usually show up for your family reunions ?
__label__anger	Is Stanley still singing that Elvis song ? He's really hogging the mic !
__label__noemo	Didn't you laugh through the whole movie ? I did .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'm afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too .
__label__noemo	I would like to see your summer suits .
__label__noemo	You've got it ! But are we coming back for the music , or for the fruit ? !
__label__joy	That's what friends are for .
__label__noemo	I ’ m going to vote .
__label__joy	Working in the gym is a very good way for losing weight . What else do you have ?
__label__noemo	Good evening . How many people of your party ?
__label__noemo	Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ’ s begin ! I need a volunteer .
__label__noemo	Beginning the first day of next month .
__label__noemo	Well , how about like this ?
__label__noemo	OK , I ’ ll fill out the form and come right back .
__label__joy	That's true . She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company .
__label__noemo	I know . But I must say it's still unacceptable . Couldn't you make a discount for me ? You see , we have such a long-term cooperation . And our business could be mutually beneficial .
__label__noemo	Let me think ... accounting , finance , something like that .
__label__noemo	It's a long time since you had a haircut last time , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	40 hours a week , Monday to Friday , 9 AM to 5 PM with one hour lunch break every day ..
__label__joy	I have never thought that swimming can bring us so many benefits . I only know that swimming in great waves and deep running water can train people's spirits , and enable people to be fearless of the hardships , dangers and difficulties and become brave and staunch .
__label__noemo	Apartments in the city are expensive .
__label__noemo	Actually , you do not need to go into the office to file a claim . You can do it over the phone or the Internet .
__label__joy	Yes , please give me another Calsberg .
__label__noemo	Only 350 yuan .
__label__noemo	I'm done . Can I watch TV ?
__label__noemo	This is the place I was telling you about .
__label__noemo	Which one is your favorite ? Why ?
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__anger	What a mess , Jack !
__label__noemo	Oh , yes , I know the one . How was the food ?
__label__noemo	It's exaggerated . Actually this sort of thing happens to everyone .
__label__noemo	We are here .
__label__joy	You're welcome . Goodbye .
__label__noemo	Yes , that's right . I like this city very much and would like to make my home here .
__label__noemo	No , sir . Nothing except my personal belongings , such as clothes , notebooks and some gifts .
__label__noemo	What's he trying to pull anyway .
__label__noemo	Here's your roast chicken , ma'am .
__label__joy	That sounds great . Give me a call next time you guys play .
__label__noemo	That's too bad .
__label__noemo	Jack borrowed a large sum of money from me and didn ’ t pay me back .
__label__noemo	So , I should choose that one ?
__label__noemo	Well , these mediums are still important ... they aren't a thing of the past ... But I think they might be less important now than in the past . The technology age has arrived !
__label__noemo	Certainly , perhaps .
__label__joy	All right . Wait for a moment , please .
__label__noemo	No , there is plenty of gas . I filled it up yesterday .
__label__joy	Most women follow fashion like sheep.They don't know any better than imitate .
__label__noemo	Let's have a look at the map first .
__label__noemo	Do you feel better ?
__label__noemo	Then tell me your birthplace .
__label__joy	That ’ s fantastic . I ’ m going to go try that out in my room now . good night !
__label__noemo	Yes , all right . So why ? Go on then . Say it . Oh , really , Mark . I promise I'm not going to be angry . Now why were you late ?
__label__noemo	I would too .
__label__noemo	Six .
__label__joy	It ’ s OK . It seems we have a lot in common .
__label__noemo	May I help you ?
__label__noemo	And I want to change 4000 Yuan .
__label__noemo	Can I take your order now , Madam ?
__label__noemo	I agree with you there , but you price is unreasonable .
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry . Todd , but Mr . Emory felt that it was going too slowly , and that it needed a fresh start . He should have told you .
__label__noemo	Fine . How many people are there in your party ?
__label__joy	Let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers !
__label__noemo	May I take your order now ?
__label__noemo	Give me a call tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Do you like playing tennis ?
__label__noemo	You may feel much better if you chew some gum or peanuts .
__label__noemo	Oh , wonderful ! You speak English ! I need to exchange this foreign currency .
__label__noemo	Did you join in any club activities ?
__label__noemo	... The rings please . May this ring be blessed so he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace , and continue in love until life ’ s end .
__label__noemo	OK , I'll take a message .
__label__noemo	Your pulse is weak .
__label__noemo	Hello , ABC Company .
__label__noemo	Definitely . Just hope Jenny can recover from the pain of divorce soon .
__label__noemo	My name is Zhang Due .
__label__noemo	Are there the records of Michael Jackson ?
__label__noemo	You're right . If I were the teacher , I wouldn't have done that .
__label__noemo	You moved to a new place ?
__label__surprise	That's incredible . I can't believe it .
__label__noemo	Have you been drinking ?
__label__noemo	70 yuan .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t think it ’ s very nice . And my father doesn ’ t like it . But my mother likes it very much . So we often come here .
__label__noemo	More sales !
__label__noemo	This is all you want to check out ?
__label__noemo	Bout side claim a small area of territory . Both sides tried to build border fences and began attacking each other .
__label__noemo	Honey , I ’ ll be right back !
__label__noemo	Are you a smoker ?
__label__noemo	Then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light .
__label__noemo	Who broke my chair ?
__label__noemo	Hey , Ann . You don't have a pen , do you ?
__label__noemo	This room is unacceptable . I want a new one , and I want a refund for tonight .
__label__noemo	Yes ?
__label__noemo	Can you help me , please ? Is there a public restroom near here ?
__label__noemo	I think you ’ re right . There needs to be an international response to this problem .
__label__joy	Wow ! What else does it do ?
__label__noemo	yeah ... it seems what we have on TV now are either repeats , or commercials , or low-quality shows . There's really nothing to watch .
__label__joy	Yes , you're right .
__label__noemo	No , thank you .
__label__noemo	I understand , Mr . Carmichael . I'd be glad to make it some time next week .
__label__noemo	We can always go to the cafeteria and eat .
__label__noemo	Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm .
__label__noemo	Did you happen to watch the football game last night ? The Patriots scored in the last minute !
__label__noemo	Pick-up lines don ' t work !
__label__noemo	You must go to immigration to the departure lounge .
__label__noemo	No , not at all . I was on the swimming team in high school.And I'd like to do some weight training . They have decent equipment at that gym .
__label__noemo	As a teacher , I don ’ t know how to help him .
__label__noemo	Because of the low salaries .
__label__noemo	Very funny ! Get a move on ! People will be here any minute .
__label__noemo	So , why did you leave PCC ?
__label__noemo	Of course , you can.All you need is a little help and a lot of practice .
__label__noemo	Of course not.He drowned .
__label__joy	How did you know ! There's a program on ancient Egypt tonight .
__label__noemo	I am not sure , sir . Generally we can , but look at the traffic . It's the rush hour .
__label__noemo	All right . I ’ ll call her later .
__label__noemo	I will have someone bring that up right away . How would like to pay for the dinner ?
__label__joy	Thank you for calling.Goodbye .
__label__noemo	It is difficult for old people to do away with old ideas .
__label__noemo	OK , wait a moment please .
__label__joy	You ’ re right .
__label__noemo	It rained all day yesterday . The weather was awful last week .
__label__noemo	OK , it's no problem .
__label__noemo	You can't help learning when you're using it all day . You'll see . A few weeks'study in the school will have a similar effect on you .
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__noemo	Have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals .
__label__noemo	Yes . Such people don ’ t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs .
__label__joy	Here comes Jordan , though .
__label__noemo	Well , I approach things very enthusiastically , I think , and I don ’ t like to leave something half-done . It makes me nervous . I can ’ t concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished .
__label__noemo	Yes . A few days ago I have no right to get a driving licence . But now I get it .
__label__noemo	I know . Maybe you will get the air if you go against her .
__label__noemo	How much is it ?
__label__noemo	What is the whether like in Washington at this time of this year ?
__label__noemo	Are you feeling better today , Bill ?
__label__noemo	Good morning , madam . What can I do for you ?
__label__joy	Good for you ! Have you seen Kelly recently ? Is she still dating nick ?
__label__noemo	I think that ’ s settled .
__label__noemo	Wow ! All because of Super Bulk-Up .
__label__joy	I wear size 32 . This one looks nice . Where may I try it on ?
__label__noemo	He told me to stay in bed for ten days .
__label__noemo	Yeah , that's very important .
__label__joy	Thank you so much , Mr Addison .
__label__noemo	OK . I'll just need to see a credit card and passport .
__label__surprise	Really , what's going to happen now ?
__label__noemo	All right , I'll let you know when I get through .
__label__noemo	Tomorrow morning .
__label__noemo	What ? You want to drive me bankrupt ! You can't expect us to make such a large reduction .
__label__noemo	Yes , what size is in your mind ?
__label__noemo	Er ... Hum ... Got it .
__label__noemo	Yes , it does . Domestic enterprises of different ownerships enjoy equal rights for the non-discrimination principle grants equal rights to enterprises , regardless of their nationality and ownership . I have found that although changes of China's economic policies are numerous , these changes are largely based on the most important economic principle ot TO agreement-non-discrimination principle . Such an understanding of principle of the changes may help us not only to have a good insight into the changes but also to foresee the tendency of the new changes of China's economic policies .
__label__noemo	These here are all mediums .
__label__joy	I'm very delighted too . I'm sure that we'll have a wider range of cooperation . So , let's drink to the signing of our contract .
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . She told me that she had learned very quickly how to pour oil on troubled waters , but not to pour oil on the flame .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll take this blouse and skirt please .
__label__noemo	Who's that ?
__label__joy	Wow , you ’ Ve inspired me to do something !
__label__joy	Yeah . Though she was so popular , I heard she managed to maintain a low profile .
__label__joy	Let's not exchange any gifts at all .
__label__noemo	What style will the ads be ?
__label__noemo	Hey ! How about your history teacher ?
__label__noemo	That's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . You will not run your car without fuel , and yet you expect your body to work without food .
__label__noemo	20-30 % . But we proposed the plan from the storage and delivery viewpoint . That is to say , less warehouse space and prompt delivery .
__label__noemo	Of course , madam .
__label__noemo	The Redskin ’ s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . We ’ re losing again .
__label__noemo	I think that she had a litter too much of the punch .
__label__noemo	Why , she's only $ 29.95 .
__label__noemo	Actually , the company will provide you with all of these supplies . So , you can leave this very thick notebook at home .
__label__noemo	Oh , maybe not . It's just your guess . Do not give currency to idle gossip .
__label__noemo	Is this evening too soon ?
__label__noemo	I'd love something spicy . Maybe we could get some Sichuan Hotpot .
__label__anger	I was late for work because of them .
__label__anger	Yeah , yeah , I know what I selected . Just give me my money !
__label__noemo	You're meal also include soup and salad .
__label__noemo	I see .
__label__noemo	I only started looking for a job a few days ago .
__label__noemo	How do these storms affect the people who live in these areas ?
__label__noemo	There're so many people here . Where are Rich and Cath and Taylor's parents ?
__label__noemo	Don ’ t use office phones for personal matters .
__label__noemo	Yes , sir . I acted as a secretary in an insurance company .
__label__noemo	Well , when they leave the hospital , give me a call and I'll come back .
__label__noemo	Oh , I guess I didn't see it .
__label__noemo	Well , I've been very busy recently and I'm having trouble keeping up to date with everything , so I just wondered what exact service you offer .
__label__noemo	How do you spend your spare time ?
__label__noemo	Dick , I ’ Ve decided not to rent that house .
__label__noemo	If it were up to Tom , we'd have the wedding in the ETV ? He loves to sing .
__label__noemo	Yes . For me , who can't hold much liquor , it's particularly agreeable . If only I had thechance to enjoy Chinese Matai at a leisured pace while sitting at a Western banquet !
__label__noemo	OK . I will pay it by my bank card .
__label__joy	Jenny , are you having fun here ?
__label__noemo	yes , cats are always gentle . and they don't need a lot of space since they're small .
__label__noemo	Is that my blood going into that tube ?
__label__noemo	Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening .
__label__noemo	Oh , dear . Did you lose a lot of money ?
__label__noemo	Oh . So you think you can just do whatever you want , do you ?
__label__noemo	This place is so quiet and peaceful . It ’ s really different from my pad at city .
__label__joy	OK , see you later .
__label__joy	Sounds good . The food there is fantastic too .
__label__noemo	Why ? I think the meeting went well .
__label__noemo	Yes , ' Foreign Exchange Registration ' , for Bank Drafts , Bills of Exchange and so on . Also , approval of RIB accounts , capital verification and so on .
__label__joy	Hello Dr Peters . Just fine thank you . Ricky and I are here for his vaccines .
__label__joy	There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and I love the light in this room .
__label__noemo	Well , could I have coffee instead of orange juice ?
__label__joy	Hi.It ' s a wonderful wedding , isn't it ?
__label__joy	Wait ! We have T-bone , rib eye , and sirloin steaks . They are very fresh ! Just came from the slaughter house ...
__label__noemo	Good afternoon . It's a pleasure to see you again ! What can we do for you today ?
__label__surprise	I'm so surprised , B . Why did you decide to end your marriage suddenly ?
__label__noemo	Do you feel that you are exceptionally good at anything in particular .
__label__noemo	I already had a burger yesterday .
__label__noemo	That ’ s great . Can you speak Chinese ?
__label__noemo	I want to buy a drink .
__label__noemo	For today ?
__label__noemo	Really ? Let me check it .
__label__noemo	Yes . If you don't mind sharing room with someone else , there's one available .
__label__noemo	Yes , of course . Would you like to make an inspection tour of some factories ?
__label__noemo	Would you kindly spell it for me ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I ’ m sorry I can ’ t.because I have to do some housework.You can ask Jenny to go with you .
__label__noemo	Mary , today a man from an intermediary gave me a call .
__label__noemo	Are the batteries in it made by your people ?
__label__joy	Well , children usually resemble their parents .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I believe it , but I want to know if you will give me a raise .
__label__noemo	Would you care to make another appointment ?
__label__noemo	Is he all right ? There's a big hospital just around the corner .
__label__noemo	No problem .
__label__noemo	What day is it on earth ?
__label__noemo	Well , that's a bit stiff . Do you have some cheaper ones ?
__label__noemo	How about interviews ? Have you been on any of those yet ?
__label__noemo	But what about tomorrow ? What if Stars.com decides to go with WebTracker , and not us ?
__label__joy	No wonder you can control your voice so well . You are a professional singer .
__label__noemo	You'll soon graduate from your university . Do you have any plans for the future ?
__label__noemo	lt's about 180C , but in winter the temperature may fall to 10-15 degrees below zero . And we have a long winter .
__label__noemo	Oh , don't be so sad . You can ask for a salary raise .
__label__noemo	Absolutely .
__label__noemo	It ’ ll be mailed to you within two weeks , but you can borrow books on the temporary card .
__label__noemo	I really need to lose some weight . I should go on a diet .
__label__noemo	How are the children doing at sport ?
__label__noemo	Select ' pay multiple beneficiaries ' , here ... then select ' pay from the account ' in the drop down menu ... OK , good . Then we need to enter the beneficiary statement reference .
__label__noemo	Well , you'd better start studying harder if you want to pass this class .
__label__noemo	I see .
__label__noemo	How would you like your steak done ?
__label__joy	Yes , thank you very much .
__label__noemo	Not yet . I am looking for a black suitcase .
__label__noemo	Do I have to remind you that your grandma is arriving tonight ?
__label__noemo	Is there , sir ? I'm very sorry . I'll change it straight away .
__label__noemo	No , not really .
__label__noemo	I can handle that . I can operate word - processor , fax machine , photostat , and other office equipments .
__label__noemo	What kind of stamps do you want ?
__label__noemo	So you're quite happy with your new job ?
__label__noemo	Yes , madam .
__label__noemo	Too bad man , tonight is Tracy ’ s going away party and she asked if you were gonna go .
__label__noemo	I know . I am still going to clean it up .
__label__noemo	As a matter of fact , he gave me this address .
__label__noemo	I really wish the weather would just stay the same .
__label__noemo	Ok , we will . How do you get around in the evenings ?
__label__noemo	These look strange .
__label__noemo	how old is she ?
__label__noemo	Hello , this is Miller . I'm calling about the appointment with Mr . Zhang for this afternoon . Something's just come up , I'm afraid the appointment will have to be rescheduled , I'm very sorry about the change .
__label__noemo	I think you're right . There needs to be an international response to this problem ?
__label__noemo	That's nice . Where have you been ?
__label__noemo	Yes , certainly . How can I recognize him ?
__label__noemo	Honey , it's good if you spend money to buy more books . But $ 100 dollars a week is enough for you already .

__label__joy	That's OK .

__label__noemo	At your service . Will this suit you ?
__label__noemo	Does their daughter get along well with her in-laws ?
__label__noemo	Of course I know . But there is too high a rate . Frankly speaking , the maximum discount we can make is 6 % .
__label__noemo	Maybe there's something wrong with her .
__label__noemo	What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps .
__label__noemo	All right , I'll have a dozen of the dollar ones .
__label__noemo	of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though .
__label__noemo	Well , I'm meeting some American friends next weekend .
__label__noemo	I understand , Ms . Fairbanks .
__label__joy	Yes , we have to.Do you think you can make it tomorrow ?
__label__sadness	Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry .
__label__noemo	I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark . She then asked if I was his sister , and I said no , I was his wife . She hung up immediately .
__label__joy	Yes , they are . This afternoon , I ’ m going to prune the hedge .
__label__noemo	I see . Including bonus ?
__label__noemo	how ’ s it going ?
__label__noemo	Oh , really ?
__label__noemo	You are welcome . Please feel free to ask if you have any more questions .
__label__noemo	Besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . In cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the International Center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year .
__label__noemo	No , I'm not sure where they sell nice bedroom sets .
__label__noemo	Hmmm.Not good . They ’ re too tight.The length is right , but the shoe is too narrow and it ’ s pinching my toes . And there ’ d be no room for my insoles . You know what ? I don ’ t think I have the patience for this today . They just don ’ t make shoes like they used to . I ’ ll come back another time .
__label__noemo	So if I buy a dozen , I'll get two free tubes of toothpaste ?
__label__noemo	Sure , what is the problem ?
__label__surprise	what ? How could you forget to reserve the concert tickets ?
__label__noemo	the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive .
__label__noemo	Sure , people do that when they are drunk . What about the actress ?
__label__noemo	The bank closes in 30 minutes and I need to cash a check .
__label__surprise	What's wrong with MSG ? It helps to bring out the taste of the food .

__label__noemo	Right .
__label__noemo	I know you didn't .
__label__noemo	As you know , before shipment , the Commodity InspectionBureau inspected the goods in question . They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export .
__label__noemo	Good afternoon ! Sit down , please.How are you ?
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__noemo	Usually , I go to London twice a year but sometimes I go three or four times a year .
__label__noemo	OK , can you name the items in it ?
__label__noemo	Do you still like playing those games ?
__label__noemo	We have a storage place here , but you have to leave a deposit .
__label__joy	Don't worry , Mary , I've got you covered .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Come on . Tell me what happened .
__label__joy	I know the feeling . I ’ m calling to let you know about this new Italian place I found . It ’ s right around the corner .
__label__noemo	Um , because I was busy talking to my friend .
__label__noemo	There ’ s an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions . I enjoyed reading her thought . The “ which ? ” section is very interesting this month . They tested facial cleaners . The article recommends “ all clear ” for effectiveness and price .
__label__noemo	No . I'm going to pay the bill for the company's lunch .
__label__anger	Leave me ! Go away !
__label__noemo	The national anthem of Canada is ' O Canada ' .
__label__noemo	Thank you for meeting me at the airport , Steven .
__label__noemo	It is at 8 o'clock .
__label__joy	Thank you !
__label__noemo	Parents have a difficult job . They have to bring up their children and usually have to work too .
__label__noemo	I'm tired . I need a rest .
__label__noemo	I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation .
__label__noemo	She wants to be a manager .
__label__noemo	What's the new strike ?
__label__joy	I agree . Maybe we can come back again next week .
__label__noemo	How many different varieties of products do you import from China ?
__label__noemo	I think that maybe Chinese families are closer than your families .
__label__noemo	All right.Take a seat , please.Would you like to be a shop assistant or a cashier ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me . Can I open a postal savings account in your office ?
__label__noemo	Well , I ’ m not everyone-else ’ s father . I think you need be in the house by ten o ’ clock .
__label__noemo	Yeah .
__label__noemo	What ’ s up ?
__label__noemo	I don ’ t understand . Maybe they feel they are okay and driving fast seems very cool .
__label__noemo	Yeah , the air is really fresh .
__label__noemo	I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard .
__label__noemo	You are right . Some ring tone is just terribly loud . You can hear it even in the next door . It is really a kind of distraction .
__label__noemo	Then let's go in .
__label__joy	Good.So we don't have to work.How nice !
__label__noemo	Hold on ! I can't afford to pay for both .
__label__noemo	No problem . Do you have any cash on you ? I don ’ t think I have enough .
__label__noemo	No , not much . My wife doesn't like to ski . She prefers vacationing where it's warmer , like Hawaii .
__label__noemo	We are at 2368 King Street East .
__label__noemo	Oh , Yes ?
__label__noemo	Life's so boring .
__label__noemo	What will the girls do ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I have .
__label__noemo	Yes . There is a large swimming pool , but it is only available in summer .
__label__noemo	Well , some people use a standard set of words , but many couples today write their own wedding vows .
__label__noemo	From reviewing your resume I can see that you have ample experience for this position.What I want to know is why you think you ’ re right for the job .
__label__noemo	He said that he had a really bad cold .
__label__noemo	Ok , then you need to go to Tai Power Building Station .
__label__noemo	Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
__label__noemo	I'd like a ticket for that flight please .
__label__joy	That's fine . Then let's sign a contract .
__label__joy	Why not now ? I'm hungry .
__label__noemo	It ’ s my mother . She ’ s fond of swimming . And the man beside her is my father .
__label__noemo	I stopped you for driving through a red light .
__label__noemo	Hello sir , may I help you ?
__label__joy	Yes . That's why I like the house .
__label__noemo	Can you put your hand where it hurts the most ?
__label__noemo	I hear Yolanda has been studying every night this week for the exam .
__label__noemo	She was a bit nervous , I guess . What else ?
__label__noemo	Maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they are actually showing off !
__label__noemo	Then what do I do ?
__label__noemo	Because she's not responsible enough .
__label__noemo	Hello , Chandler ! How are you ?
__label__noemo	Although you spare no effort to complete the project . I think you have missed the boat .
__label__noemo	What problem ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s good . What special skills do you have , can you tell me ?
__label__noemo	she's far better than my old boss . He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down .
__label__noemo	Sure . He ’ ll get the bag , I think .
__label__noemo	Yes , it is .
__label__noemo	Thank you so much . Have you got a credit card , Mr . Sandals ?
__label__noemo	Well , I haven't made such arrangements with the factory yet . So I'd like to make sure if it is acceptable to the factory before making a commitment to you .
__label__noemo	It doesn't matter , you should have called and let me know .
__label__noemo	that's true , but you already have two back coats and one black sweater .
__label__noemo	Will you travel by sea or by air ?
__label__noemo	Your room will be ready in half an hour .
__label__joy	Sure , that ’ d be great.Where would you like to go ?
__label__noemo	You mean like a breast enlargement ? I don't think that's really necessary . That's not the way a woman should stay attractive .
__label__noemo	Sir ?
__label__noemo	So , right at the traffic lights two miles up the road , then left at the plaza hotel , a mile along that road . Got it .
__label__noemo	Hi . May I help you ?
__label__sadness	I fell down and hurt my arm .
__label__noemo	Come in , come in , what can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Oh , OK , I said ( XXXXXXXXXX ) on time .
__label__noemo	Certainly.Here ’ s an application form.Do you have proof of residence ?
__label__noemo	1:30 P . m . But I've got to check in at 12:30 P . m .
__label__joy	Yes , I enjoyed it very much .
__label__noemo	How much does the green one cost ?
__label__noemo	I appreciate your help , but I think I'll look around a bit .
__label__noemo	not if you are good at net-working . Do you like to meet new people ?
__label__noemo	My rear bumper is messed up .
__label__noemo	They're small fry . Tonight I'm going to LA to negotiate with Stars.com . That'll be big .
__label__noemo	Well , do what you like to do . It can be anything . Jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong . Absolutely anything . Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . But remember to do some stretches first .
__label__noemo	That's right .
__label__noemo	You said it . I'm looking forward to my annual vacation .
__label__noemo	Oh , it's the high time for you purchasing in our clothes shop . We are now having a preseason sale on all our winter apparel .
__label__noemo	OK , go ahead--what is the excuse THIS time ?
__label__noemo	Have you heard about Alice and David ?
__label__noemo	What sort of proof do you need ?
__label__noemo	Ah , yes , the room is too cold for me . I feel rather cold when I sleep . Can you turn off the air-conditioning ?
__label__sadness	It's us .
__label__anger	Don ’ t tell me what to do ! I ’ ll get to it when I get around to it !
__label__noemo	Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ?
__label__noemo	Is a white blouse OK ?
__label__joy	You like it , huh ?
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__noemo	It ’ s been leaking for a couple of days now .
__label__noemo	Hey , Pat ! Yeah , I haven ’ t seen you in ages ! How is going ?
__label__noemo	I don't think so . I know I've put on weight this winter .
__label__noemo	I need job security .
__label__noemo	Regular will be fine . How long will it take ?
__label__noemo	I think you've lost it .
__label__surprise	Really ? That's so great . Congratulations .
__label__joy	Yeah , but she looks amazing .
__label__noemo	At the Friendship Hotel in Beijing .
__label__joy	That sounds great .
__label__noemo	My brother has last year's Accord . And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . I really like that color . I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord .
__label__noemo	If you are selected for the position , you must prepare to travel overseas frequently .
__label__noemo	You ’ re sure we ’ re not forgetting anything ?
__label__noemo	Hello , this is Smith from 1308 , can you add something to my room ?
__label__noemo	We'd like to take a tour to Florence .
__label__noemo	I like chess better than xiangqi . And you ?
__label__noemo	Right . Hold the steering wheel with your hands at ten o'clock and two o'clock .
__label__noemo	That ’ s fine , as long as you can get that report typed up before you leave .
__label__noemo	Yes , I know . I have a disability.My hip was broken last year . And I can't walk well .
__label__noemo	I'd like to say good-bye to everyone .
__label__noemo	You can also play Ccds on it if you hook it up to your TV .
__label__noemo	But I make it .
__label__joy	I went a global warming rally in London . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
__label__noemo	Did I do well on my test ?
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	Good morning . Vane Theater , at your service .
__label__noemo	I haven't told you what happened yet , have I ?
__label__noemo	No , you can learn a lot from them .
__label__noemo	Thank you , sir . I ’ ll leave them here . If there are no problems , I ’ ll mail them out this afternoon .
__label__noemo	No problem at all . Welcome .
__label__noemo	Very affordable mam . You can take it out of this lot today with 0 % down payment and no interest for the first year ! You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .
__label__noemo	It's not time consuming at all .
__label__sadness	Perhaps , but I haven ’ t felt well for a few days now .
__label__noemo	Um , very nice . It's warm in spring and cool in autumn .
__label__noemo	Push the red button on the mike to turn it on .
__label__noemo	come on , dear ! You forgot it , too .
__label__noemo	Do you sell washing machines ?
__label__noemo	I just got back from London .
__label__noemo	You know , I am poor at English , especially spoken English .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry to hear that . I'll have to examine you .
__label__noemo	Personally , I think it ’ d be better to go when you have more time . A few days isn ’ t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
__label__noemo	Would you tell me the rate per day for depositing my bag ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to work in a law firm to enrich my experience and put what I've learned into practice .
__label__noemo	Well , my particular interest is collecting stamps , especially the rare ones . What about you ?
__label__noemo	Hi , I made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle . The name is Jimmy Fox .
__label__noemo	I have had disagreement with every director . I ’ Ve worked with . We ’ Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . It was the same when I made this movie . I don ’ t know where rumours of my disagreement with Rachel Kelly come from . We got on very well and I hope to work with her again . I enjoyed making the movie very much .
__label__noemo	About 15 . I've seen him work hard for a lot of good changes .
__label__joy	We like to get together , chat and enjoy beautiful music .
__label__joy	Or just stuff the whole thing in your mouth at once !
__label__noemo	Yes , why not ? I mean , if you come to this cafe often , maybe we could meet here and practice Chinese and English .
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	men are allowed to take 10 days of paternity leave for their first child .
__label__noemo	did you have to pay a deposit ?
__label__noemo	That's true.But I feel that I see more when I travel by bus .
__label__noemo	Good afternoon , Miss Tao . Please sit down .
__label__noemo	You are not the gray train , I guess . But bite the bullet and you'll soon be in the chips again .
__label__joy	Coffee , please .
__label__noemo	How so ?
__label__noemo	They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest .
__label__noemo	Hello . Is that Nicholas ?
__label__noemo	Is a home inspection very expensive ?
__label__noemo	I don't think I share your view there.The writer is writing about history , society , human nature and so on.It ' s too hard to understand .
__label__noemo	Why they hold a flour war ?
__label__joy	Of course . I will .
__label__noemo	No . What happened ?
__label__noemo	The price is moderate , but their work is sometimes not satisfactory .
__label__joy	Sure , madam . I ’ ll remind you .
__label__joy	I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . It may offer you many benefits . First , it's good for your health . I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate . While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . You might as well sleep out for a longer hour .
__label__noemo	I'm calling to see if you have made your decision . You are the right person we are seeking for .
__label__noemo	if you aren't thin , you're nobody .
__label__noemo	She's on the M40 , near Reading .
__label__noemo	My sister did it . When did you get yours cut ?
__label__noemo	I'll put all that into the bag for you .
__label__joy	Me , too .
__label__noemo	Now you're my boss , Mr . Henry .
__label__joy	I not only passed my test , but I aced it ! I'm so happy !
__label__noemo	It ’ s not very big . It ’ s a little over half a million square kilometers .
__label__noemo	I see , actually the hardware is the easy part , I do want to study how to use the software .
__label__noemo	You look kind of green .
__label__noemo	$ 88 for a single ticket .
__label__noemo	What was your minor subject ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it is a queer drug , a tonic only available in China . Many ancient Chinese medicine journals have recorded that it can cure such ailments as night sweat , pain at loins and knees and anaemia . It has no side effect .
__label__noemo	Let's see ... my ID card , my passport , and my suitcase . I'm pretty sure I've got everything .
__label__noemo	Hi , Nally , are you hungry ?
__label__noemo	Don't dis my hair ! I like it like this .
__label__noemo	Sorry . When was this purse purchased ?
__label__noemo	Well , I do not know Chinese tea at all .
__label__noemo	Maybe the master suite has some redeeming qualities . Follow me , please .
__label__noemo	Laura told me today that she has a friend with a car for sale .
__label__noemo	You will get it in a few weeks .
__label__joy	Good morning . My name is Penny White . I'm new here .
__label__noemo	Thank you , Ms . In . I'm here to discuss the possibility of establishing business relations with your corporation .
__label__noemo	Ok , please come to my office at 9 AM next Monday . I will introduce you to our boss .
__label__joy	OK . Bon voyage and a safe landing .
__label__noemo	Yes , I ’ m thinking about signing up for a tour in the travel agency . Their next tour starts the same time as my holiday does next month .
__label__noemo	Then , when do you plan to get married ?
__label__noemo	It was a real red letter day for you .
__label__noemo	no way , Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill .
__label__noemo	You know I did .
__label__noemo	Lily thinks that the job takes a back seat to the family after she is married .
__label__noemo	Where's the nearest bank ?
__label__noemo	Good luck out there .
__label__noemo	Good.We ' re tired after driving all day , and we're looking forward to relaxing in a comfortable room .
__label__sadness	I want to go fishing today , but I have left my rod and fishing line at home .
__label__sadness	That's too bad.What kind of accident is it ? Are you all right ?
__label__noemo	Yeah . We should have more roads built .
__label__noemo	Good , because my friend Wendy is getting married and I ’ m organizing her party !
__label__noemo	What do you think the problem was ?
__label__noemo	I hope you will have second thoughts .
__label__noemo	So soon . Why don ’ t you stay a little longer ?
__label__noemo	Ah , yes , a table for four at 8
__label__joy	Thank you . It's very kind of you to invite me to such a beautiful place .
__label__noemo	Here is the bag . Is that free ?
__label__noemo	Oh , Mr Green , my name is Jianshan . You don't know me , but I'm a friend of David Smith .
__label__noemo	Yes , of course . There are many steps . You can apply for the job on the Internet and then send your resume to the e-mail address of the company . And wail the feedback of the company .
__label__joy	We ’ re going to the Dragon Boat Festival tomorrow . Feel like coming along ?
__label__joy	Here you go . That's everything , then . Thanks very much for your service over the years .
__label__joy	Oh , I know . Thank you .
__label__joy	That's exactly what I am thinking about , And also it's a good way to get social experiences .
__label__surprise	Wow . That's too much for me . Don't you have anything cheaper ?
__label__noemo	Is it serious ?
__label__noemo	That's because you don't know the short cuts . You'll learn them after a while . I can show you the ropes .
__label__noemo	There are something wrong with my computer .
__label__noemo	Neither can I .
__label__noemo	I don't know . Something rotten here ?
__label__noemo	Actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . I made far too much food to eat alone . I am glad you could come over to help me finish it .
__label__noemo	Okay . Have it your way , but don't say I didn't warn you .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'm glad we've had very pleasant cooperation in the previous years . And your achievement for promoting our clothes was great in the three years .
__label__joy	Hey ! I thought you weren't interested ! Sorry , I've gotta go ! I'm going to switch over to eBay and see if my bid is still the highest .
__label__noemo	Thank you for helping me .
__label__noemo	Yes , that's right , around five nine five ten .
__label__noemo	First , the languages on the label should be in both English and French . Second , the red color doesn't suit our national customs . Could you print the label in some light colors such as yellowish or bluish ?
__label__noemo	China .
__label__joy	Oh , it ’ s my favorite . How much is it ?
__label__joy	Thank you . When and where shall we meet ?
__label__noemo	Well , if you need anything , just let me know .
__label__joy	I also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . You know she didn't treat you that well . Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
__label__noemo	Have you obtained any certificate of technical qualifications or license ?
__label__noemo	If it's a problem , you don't have to do it for me .
__label__noemo	I didn't know you were scared of heights ! Was it really bad ?
__label__noemo	Mr . : Would you like to go to the nurse's ?
__label__noemo	Serves you right .
__label__noemo	Do you have your ID with you ?
__label__noemo	Goodbye .
__label__noemo	Good morning ! I am a rookie in our office .
__label__joy	Well , I ddin't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! We have so much in common . We like the same teams , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends .
__label__noemo	Do you think it ’ s safe to leave to get a quick bite ?
__label__noemo	It's still available . Do you want to see it ?
__label__noemo	Good morning . May I help you ?
__label__noemo	You are an early bird , Tom . What do you do in the morning then ?
__label__noemo	Let me see.Yes , we have one room left.You ' re lucky.It ' s the last one .
__label__noemo	What about this one ?
__label__noemo	No , it's the Japanese team .
__label__noemo	Yes , I do .
__label__noemo	Do you have a fever ?
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__anger	Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work .
__label__noemo	I would like to reschedule .
__label__joy	Oh , very interesting . And what about Rita ? She was such a bright child — always reading .
__label__noemo	No problem , I'll settle that now . You can take it from my Business Account .
__label__noemo	What about early next week ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I would like to place an order for toner cartridges . We have a standing agreement with you company , so we will need the same amount as last time .
__label__noemo	Will you be able to make up the work you missed ?
__label__noemo	Look ! there's a Folk concert tomorrow evening . Do you Want to go ?
__label__joy	I'd love it.Working out is more fun with a friend .
__label__sadness	Yeah , I'm very nauseous . It's mostly nausea and a fever .
__label__joy	Yup , because dance can relax myself .
__label__noemo	Do you like playing table tennis ?
__label__noemo	Yes , but he ’ s got a wife and 3 children as well .
__label__sadness	I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans .
__label__noemo	Yes . I want to buy a pair of shoes .
__label__noemo	Could you repeat that please ?
__label__noemo	Goodbye , and try not to miss any more school .
__label__noemo	Whatever we do , we should do it above board .
__label__joy	I see.Thank you , doctor .
__label__joy	Hello , Candy . My name is Jim White . Nice to meet you .
__label__noemo	Where did you get all these barney tour pamphlets ?
__label__noemo	Could you tell me how this thing is cooked ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , it's lovely , but to be frank , it's not the most practical . You don't have many formal events in your calendar , do you ?
__label__noemo	I was sick most of the night .
__label__noemo	I need your help .
__label__noemo	Room service.May I come in ?
__label__noemo	Good afternoon .
__label__noemo	Why aren't you doing your homework ?
__label__noemo	Sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals , but those stories are rare .
__label__noemo	What seems to be the problem ?
__label__noemo	It's not just spreading out to new markets that we have to address . I think we'd better first pay attention to developing our brand in the markets we already have.We ' Ve reached the awareness level , but we haven't established customer loyalty . People know who we are , but they still don't trust in our brand .
__label__noemo	That's too bad . Why don't you try using lures instead ?
__label__noemo	I cannot let anything happen to that tripod.Can you guarantee it will not be damaged if I check it in ?
__label__noemo	Because your travel agency has a good fame in this market ; what's more , all the staff here are working very hard . I like doing some challenging job .
__label__disgust	I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ?
__label__noemo	Oh . That ’ s a pity . I thought that we might go hiking in the hills .
__label__joy	I absolutely love the apartment .
__label__noemo	It's only 4.5 % for one-year loan . Do you want to apply now ?
__label__noemo	With or without private bathroom ?
__label__noemo	Don't you have any Chinese food ?
__label__noemo	Do what you have to do ! One other thing , don ’ t tell the rest of the stockholders about this . If they find out , it ’ s the end of this company !
__label__noemo	Hello , is Doris available ?
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	Oh look , they have some refreshments in here .
__label__joy	I hope to go there someday .
__label__noemo	I suppose skiing is easy for you .
__label__noemo	Yes . May I know the number ?
__label__noemo	Hello . This is the Stewart Resident .
__label__noemo	I guess we should see Big Ben soon .
__label__noemo	Good morning .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Have you been to the Queen Street West ?
__label__joy	You are very welcome .
__label__noemo	He borrowed it from Nick .
__label__noemo	Let ’ s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples !
__label__noemo	You can't miss it . Add the class and then come back . We'll check later to make sure you are on the roll sheet .
__label__noemo	I must have taken a wrong turn .
__label__noemo	No . In fact , prior to their boarding the bus and their getting off the bus , I will make an announcement to remind them that they should check their belongings .
__label__noemo	Can you describe a mango to me ?
__label__noemo	Great party , isn ’ t it ?
__label__noemo	Thank you . I will .
__label__noemo	We ’ re having a department meeting at 10 o ’ clock , ok ?
__label__noemo	Me too . I ’ ll see you after work , huh ?
__label__noemo	You were so happy , weren ’ t you ?
__label__noemo	Oh dear . What a pity . Are you sure you lost your wallet in theatre ?
__label__noemo	Go down this way until you come to the drugstore . Make a left turn and it's just there .
__label__noemo	Have you just started getting a lot of headaches ?
__label__noemo	You look a bit pale , don't you ?
__label__noemo	You ’ re welcome .
__label__noemo	don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself .
__label__noemo	Well then , thanks for your help . Have a great day !
__label__disgust	Me too .
__label__noemo	No.You can't suddenly make smoking illegal . But the government could prohibit smoking in public places like cinemas and theaters .
__label__noemo	Yes , your number is out of service .
__label__noemo	Wait a minute . This is your safe box key , don't lose it . You'll have to pay two thousand yuan if you lose the key .
__label__noemo	Maintenance Department . May I come in ?
__label__noemo	The order is so urgently required that we have to ask you to speed up shipment . If shipment is too late , we'll have to turn to other suppliers .
__label__noemo	It depends what it is . Once we have disconnected the unit , we do as many jobs as we can . If there is something that isn't broken but might cause a problem before the next service then of course we repair it or replace that part . But if it's not urgent , we make a note in the service record to carry out that repair next time .
__label__noemo	Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .
__label__noemo	You were playing it very late last night .
__label__noemo	I have the perfect option , this package will take you on a hiking trip through the Himalayas for three days and afterwards there ’ s a dog sledding journey !
__label__noemo	Sure . What movies were you thinking about going to ?
__label__noemo	Sure you can , in about two and a half weeks .
__label__noemo	I am , but there is too much material to cover . I ’ ll be writing forever , and Grant only wants five to seven pages .
__label__surprise	Why ? I have stayed for 3 nights .
__label__noemo	I have one . We could share it . Which way are you going ?
__label__noemo	What kind of food will they be serving ?
__label__noemo	Don ’ t you think you would miss having other people around ?
__label__noemo	Turn on the shower .
__label__noemo	Nah ! Let ’ s go get a burger and fries .
__label__noemo	How long have you been in Taiwan ?
__label__noemo	Yes , but Americans never visit without calling in advance , and they almost never stay overnight .
__label__noemo	It'll take her only a few minutes to get online .
__label__surprise	What ? ! You did that ? ? ! ! !
__label__noemo	that ’ s interesting . What does your grandfather think of your step-mother ?
__label__noemo	No , it's D408 , my parking space . I have already paid for it .
__label__noemo	I'd love to , the movies are smash hit .
__label__noemo	I see that you have some impressive writing experience .
__label__noemo	I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .
__label__noemo	Let's keep in touch .
__label__joy	I ’ m not worried about our country now that it ’ s in his hands .
__label__noemo	Sure ! What kind of food would you like ?
__label__joy	Oh , well , would you look at that ! Polarizing filters .
__label__noemo	Honey , cross my heart , I'v never looked at another woman since the first day I set my eyes on you ! Believe me , that's the truth .
__label__noemo	That's right , maybe then you'll respect my rules .
__label__noemo	Good . I want an estimate of damages as soon as possible .
__label__joy	Sure , anything you say .
__label__noemo	I see . Well , there ’ s no rush . Please send it via priority mail . Please be extra careful , the contents of the package are fragile .
__label__noemo	May I help you ?
__label__noemo	That's an excellent question . I'll bet your wondering why we ask you to wear hard hats and safety googles while you's in the plant . The reason is simple , we care about your safety and we want to ensure there are no injuries today . As you will see , to maintain a high level of safety , we also require all of our staff to wear similar protective gear .
__label__noemo	December the fifteenth . The day after tomorrow is little Tom ’ s birthday .
__label__noemo	The CD player is a three-disk player . Here , we'll put a disk in so you can check out the sound . ( He puts a CD into the CD player . )
__label__noemo	I agree . I guess I was paying more attention to her answers than her body language .
__label__noemo	What a pity ! How about tomorrow evening ?
__label__noemo	$ 19 a day or $ 129 a week , unlimited mileage .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes . I remember . You must be Mr Xie . It's nice to put a face to a voice .
__label__noemo	Yes , I have two years of nursing experience , and now I am working as a nurse in a hospital .
__label__noemo	Yes , sir .
__label__joy	Thank you for your letter .
__label__joy	That's great . You can go take a look .
__label__noemo	Those are company cars provided to the sales staff for their business trips . Also , some employees receive sales commissions . So good salesmen will naturally earn more .
__label__noemo	What do I do now ?
__label__noemo	What was the most significant project you've worked on ?
__label__noemo	How long do you want to keep it in our bank ?
__label__noemo	What about $ 800 ?
__label__noemo	Good morning , John . Have you finished reading the novel by Dickens borrowed from the library ?
__label__noemo	Susan , just one last week I went out to have a lunch with her . There is nothing for you to be jealous about . I like your company much better than Janet ’ s .
__label__noemo	But I think Chinese students need to exercise more . Besides exercise will help them learn new things better . Don ’ t students want to have a good memory ?
__label__surprise	Not anymore ! Can you believe it ? They've decided that Pluto is not a planet anymore !
__label__noemo	I can only read the first three lines .
__label__noemo	Sure , what's up ?
__label__joy	Next time lunch is on me .
__label__disgust	This is terrible . Why do hackers play such a dirty trick ?
__label__noemo	I was thinking about this afternoon , after the sales meeting .
__label__noemo	It ’ s an article about language . It talks about the idea of having a single global language .
__label__noemo	Yes , I like the old style dance , such as waltz 、 rumba and so on . They are quite graceful .
__label__noemo	I ’ m in , let ’ s go !
__label__noemo	Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night , instead ?
__label__sadness	I didn't do well in last exams . If my father knows it , he will beat me up .
__label__joy	I love it when the weather is like this.Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
__label__noemo	I'd prefer the night tour .
__label__noemo	As long as we ’ re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments . I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time .
__label__noemo	Good afternoon , sales department.May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Thirty bucks a record . Or five for one hundred and twenty bucks .
__label__noemo	I also want to check out this video .
__label__noemo	Correct .
__label__noemo	that's true . Beijing is the political , economic and cultural center of the entire country .
__label__noemo	Is everything all right ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry . There is no listing under that name . Are you sure of the name ?
__label__joy	That's terrific !
__label__noemo	You know the sales figure shows that the prediction has not achieved .
__label__noemo	Morning . What would you like for breakfast ?
__label__noemo	Hi Isabel ! You wanted to see me ?
__label__noemo	Let me have a look . It's mine . I have been looking for it , but just cannot find it . It's present from my father .
__label__noemo	Of course . You see , almost everyone has some kind of hobby
__label__noemo	That's right . That's the best way to have control over yourself.You say to yourself . Tonight I will gamble fifty dollars . Only fifty dollars . No more.If you follow the rule , you can't lose more than fifty dollars .
__label__noemo	Yes , that's right . That's very good .
__label__noemo	Can we solve this later ? I am calling the insurance company .
__label__joy	Have a nice day .
__label__joy	I like it very much , but it's a little confusing to me .
__label__noemo	Oh , hi , Tom . How've you been ?
__label__noemo	Yes . An passport and a visa are necessary for entry into China .
__label__noemo	Mary , I've some bad news for you .
__label__noemo	we have plenty of postcards to choose from here . The same designs can be found on these posters .
__label__joy	Thank you for bringing me here Hong , this place looks great !
__label__noemo	Make them with French dressing .
__label__joy	Thank you . I'm sure you will .
__label__noemo	Hi ! How are you going ?
__label__noemo	I like taking photos .
__label__joy	Oh , that ’ s great . Thanks Grace . Can you give me her number ? I ’ ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow . Maybe this way I won ’ t be so tired every day , and Dan and I might even get to go on a date once in a while .
__label__joy	OK , thank you .
__label__noemo	Don't worry . Family comes first . Come on , let's go .
__label__noemo	We finally get a chance to meet .
__label__noemo	Yes , please .
__label__disgust	The lecturer is dull , too .
__label__joy	And all their movements are so elegant . It seems like dancing in the water .
__label__noemo	I'd like to have medium .
__label__noemo	OK . how does this sound . let ’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there !
__label__noemo	Of course . Please sign your name here .
__label__noemo	no , but my father's car was destroyed in a flood once . It actually happened the day after he bought the car !
__label__joy	I like gardening . I take care of them everyday . I like those flowers and the swing in my garden . If the weather is nice , I would like to lie on the lawn .
__label__noemo	Sure , what would you like ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff .
__label__noemo	Yes . You will save 90 cents on each bag .
__label__noemo	So is it the right way to the City Hall ?
__label__sadness	Oh , my god .
__label__noemo	I think there's someone at the door .
__label__noemo	By the way , Richard will assist me in the planning work . I hope you can work well together .
__label__noemo	It happened last night .
__label__fear	I pressed the emergency button ! And then I stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue .
__label__noemo	Thank you . Is there a special rate for a group reservation ?
__label__noemo	Would you please have a look at my report ? I hope the project meets your demand .
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome .
__label__noemo	"Oh , no . Everything we sell here is "" as is . """
__label__noemo	Is there a name tag attached to them ?
__label__noemo	Yes , here you go .
__label__noemo	But if I have more than 55 pounds , what can I do ?
__label__noemo	No , thanks .
__label__joy	Stick around and you'll get to know him better . He has a very unusual personality .
__label__noemo	Well , we have some nice sugar .
__label__noemo	Not at all . It has a very delicate flavor .
__label__noemo	Yes . That would be fine .
__label__noemo	Carlo's Kitchen .
__label__sadness	unfortunately , he wasn't able to evacuate in time . He ended up dying in the tower .
__label__noemo	Is there an additional driver ?
__label__noemo	ok . I feel like sitting down and having a chat . How have you been recently ?
__label__noemo	It sure does .
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__noemo	Please fetch me a glass of water . Thanks .
__label__noemo	It's the key for the safety deposit box .
__label__joy	Sure . Here you are .
__label__noemo	Well , here we go again .
__label__noemo	You shouldn ’ t be nervous about that .
__label__noemo	Yes , of course . May I have your name , sir ?
__label__noemo	What about my ticket ? Do I still need to pay ?
__label__noemo	Right . Trains No . 13 and No . 14 are the best trains on the line between Beijing and Shanghai . Which seats do you prefer , cushioned seats , ordinary seats , cushioned berth , or ordinary berth ?
__label__noemo	Hello , I'd like to reconfirm my flight .
__label__noemo	I talked to them probably about two weeks ago . Yeah , everything is going well .
__label__noemo	Okay . That will be thirty-four dollars and fifty cents .
__label__noemo	How much are you withdrawing today ?
__label__joy	I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must .
__label__noemo	I guess I should just withdraw everything .
__label__noemo	Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .
__label__noemo	As an English teacher , I tried to make the lessons as fun as possible . I tried to have a good time with my classes . The students often enjoyed it.And if the students enjoyed it , they learned more . So it was a good experience .
__label__noemo	Have you got the number there ?
__label__noemo	That's better , but it's still not quite right .
__label__noemo	Do you love me ? come on , I ’ m eager to hear .
__label__noemo	It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .
__label__noemo	What is it , Mrs . Wang ?
__label__noemo	I'm doing great .
__label__joy	It sounds wonderful . Did you take lunch with you ?
__label__noemo	Do they have a large family ?
__label__noemo	Is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with ?
__label__noemo	Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English .
__label__noemo	Peter , go and tidy up your toys now .
__label__noemo	I got it . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll get you there in one piece .
__label__noemo	Yes , we regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly .
__label__noemo	I don't really know . I have just bought this new car . And it's the first time I've gotten gas for it .
__label__noemo	She will come and let you know when your table is prepared .
__label__noemo	like the job you feel the most proud of .
__label__sadness	Oh , no . It seems that I've lost my train ticket .
__label__noemo	Be prepared to provide your employer ’ s name and address and what dates you worked .
__label__noemo	I'm pressed for time and I am afraid I need someone to help me .
__label__noemo	At last ! The weekend comes again !
__label__joy	Ok - let ’ s do that then !
__label__noemo	It's easy , just write in the hours , total it , sign it , and put it in the box .
__label__noemo	Sure . What do you need ?
__label__noemo	World affairs ? They look at the most important stories in more detail . I find it fascinating . Do you buy a daily paper ?
__label__noemo	Actually , it is a policy in my company . The human resources management department has connections overseas this year , so we can receive training there .
__label__noemo	Can you teach me how to do make-up ?
__label__noemo	Oh I fell over on the way to work .
__label__joy	Oh , I ’ m crazy about them .
__label__noemo	That ’ s a perfect plan . Enjoy yourself .
__label__noemo	how so ?
__label__noemo	Sure . I strongly advise you to buy a bottle of perfume and a lighter .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry to hear that . Thank you for telling me a little more about it .
__label__noemo	Where do you see yourself three years from now ?
__label__sadness	Oh , sorry to interrupt you . But I am calling to say goodbye to you . I am awfully sorry to tell you that I am afraid I could not see you off at the airport tomorrow , because I will have to attend a very important meeting .
__label__noemo	I thought about going to my sister's . How about you ?
__label__noemo	What have you been up to , Johnny ?
__label__noemo	I will be depositing cash .
__label__noemo	It's nothing . It's not the first time anyway .
__label__surprise	Really ? Have you ever tried Moroccan ?
__label__joy	Nobody is OK , but you !
__label__noemo	Sure . I thought people only showed off pictures of their new babies , not new pets !
__label__noemo	Yes , sir . Do you need some flowers ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , you ’ re right . We aren ’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
__label__noemo	May I see your ticket and passport , please ?
__label__joy	I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it !
__label__noemo	Can I ask you a question ?
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__joy	Can you spread the word and ask everyone to bring some kind of snack food ?
__label__noemo	That's right .
__label__noemo	$ 40 per night .
__label__noemo	Aright . I'll get a tee time for Wednesday at about 4
__label__noemo	Any rain right now would be pointless .
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__noemo	Well , maybe so . But I still think everyone has their rights of their own opinion .
__label__noemo	Is that all ?
__label__noemo	You can get the sports package .
__label__noemo	well , my suggestion for a newbie like you is that don't get lost in the cyberspace . You know internet won't do the filtration for you , so you still need to use your judgement . There are a lot of per
__label__noemo	What can I offer you here ?
__label__noemo	Just this suitcase .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__noemo	Drama . I was an actor for five years after college .
__label__joy	Yes . And you also overworked in last month , when Steven asked for leave . I have been very satisfied with your performance . And your dependability has been a great asset .
__label__joy	Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower !
__label__noemo	How about this picture of cranes with pine trees ? It was painted by a famous Chinese painter in King Dynasty .
__label__noemo	He is in his office , but you'd better choose your words carefully while talking to him .
__label__noemo	I have an appointment .
__label__noemo	Yes , it is.It was taken just before I was leaving for college .
__label__joy	Yeah , you are my good helper , Steven .
__label__noemo	Well , I will text to you . Thank you , bye for now .
__label__noemo	Yes . Do you have a savings account in our bank ?
__label__noemo	But supposing your son killed like the fish , what do you think then ?
__label__noemo	You're no able to move after this class .
__label__noemo	Sure , anything else ?
__label__noemo	Just fill out these forms , and I ’ ll be with you in one second .
__label__noemo	What would you like ?
__label__noemo	I want to go to Broadway and 82nd Street.Can I take any bus that comes along ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I ’ m here for an interview as requested .
__label__noemo	Generally speaking , you are supposed to come at 9:00 am .
__label__noemo	Boots
__label__noemo	It ’ s very hot and that ’ s why I ’ d like to smoke inside .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes , it is . I'll take this one .
__label__noemo	Will that be cash or check ?
__label__noemo	Did you enjoy the movie ?
__label__noemo	If you want to cross here , be my guest . I don ’ t feel like dodging cars and scooters !
__label__joy	Tim ’ s smiles are interesting .
__label__joy	There is no need . Thanks .
__label__noemo	the Rubik's cube is so difficult to solve that I think it should be banned !
__label__joy	Thank you for all your patience .
__label__noemo	Wow ! It ’ s packed .
__label__noemo	I'll try .
__label__noemo	Yes . It says here , ' He who only half breathes , half lives . '
__label__noemo	Perhaps I should have a try .
__label__joy	It is so quiet here . I like the place .
__label__noemo	Do you think that climate change is responsible for the recent floods ?
__label__noemo	What a pity . Can you recommend a nice restaurant near here ?
__label__noemo	What is your father doing now ?
__label__disgust	You are freaking me out .
__label__noemo	Very Wang sir , smoking or no smoking ?
__label__noemo	So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer.If the problem is resources , share them .
__label__noemo	Yeah , that's a good idea . Let me try it .
__label__noemo	Do you have the time ?
__label__noemo	Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big.Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
__label__noemo	Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD .
__label__noemo	I sure did !
__label__noemo	Forgive me darling . I'm very tired .
__label__noemo	What question ?
__label__noemo	Don ’ t worry . Just check in your bag before entering .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , do you have the latest issue of Newsworld ?
__label__noemo	I have a problem .
__label__noemo	How long will it take ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry to hear that . Well , I heard that registered urban unemployment rate reached 4 percent this year , with more than half being women .
__label__noemo	Then there's the Cantonese cuisine and the Kiangsu cuisine . Most southerners like them .
__label__noemo	Once bitten , twice shy . He said he would rather keep bach than to live in disgust .
__label__noemo	I am going to register at Harvard next month .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t know . It was there when I woke up this morning .
__label__noemo	Sorry , but he's busy then too .
__label__noemo	Hello ? This is Steven . I'd like to speak to Mr . Brown , please .
__label__joy	This is great , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	I'm a student too .
__label__noemo	Sure . Where do you want to go ? Are you in the mood for anything in particular ?
__label__noemo	In 50 Yuan or 100 Yuan would be fine .
__label__noemo	Have you decided on anything ?
__label__noemo	what are your symptoms ?
__label__noemo	The front brake ?
__label__noemo	I see . I'll bring some to-go boxes for you .
__label__noemo	The Employment Development Office will send you a Notice of Unemployment Insurance Award letter .
__label__noemo	In general , a set of golf clubs 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , PW ; Woods : 1 , 3 , 5 and a putter .
__label__noemo	Do I get a card ?
__label__noemo	How far is it ?
__label__noemo	I see , that's a long time.How much was the watch ?
__label__noemo	To be frank , a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import . When I open a letter of credit with a bank , I have to pay a deposit . That will tie up my money and add to my cost .
__label__noemo	Come on ! Three's a crowd !
__label__noemo	What ’ s the problem ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I am . That ’ s right .
__label__noemo	Why not sometime next week ?
__label__joy	Sounds delicious . OK . She'll try that .
__label__joy	Lots . Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years .
__label__noemo	We have that package .
__label__noemo	You must feel very uneasy at his home .
__label__sadness	Not great . It's a kind of boring .
__label__noemo	Well , I wasn't planning on spending that much money today , so ...
__label__noemo	That'll cost too much .
__label__joy	Oh ! It's perfect . I think I'll take it . Would you wrap it , please ?
__label__noemo	I think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment , and the others can go under the seat .
__label__noemo	Oh , hello ! Sorry about that . I'm just calling to say that we've received your new Corporate Credit Card from HQ .
__label__noemo	20 yuan for a skirt .
__label__joy	Bye .
__label__noemo	Here , try this one . It ’ s a good site about Gettysburg .
__label__noemo	Well , I guess no one can help me but myself . For the moment , I just need someone to talk to , so that I can relieve my stress .
__label__noemo	Mm ... It's quite warm now .
__label__joy	Yes , that's great . Thanks .
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__joy	Well , I guess I exercise about two hours a day . I do aerobics three times a week , and the other days I play badminton with my husband . I always feel good afterward .
__label__noemo	Well , you could never tell about the weather here in New York .
__label__sadness	No . Only a few pounds . But my passport was in the bag . That ’ what I ’ m really worry about .
__label__noemo	Yes . Commission will be given on the basis of your sales revenue . And the percentage will be 2 % of your total revenue .
__label__noemo	Yes , you're right . What do you like to do in your spare time ?
__label__noemo	OK . Two tickets to London , please .
__label__joy	It seems you two bring out the best of one another .
__label__noemo	We are going to the concert this evening . Will you join us .
__label__noemo	I think there ’ s a Western on .
__label__noemo	Yes , quite sure .
__label__noemo	He has so many friends supporting him .
__label__joy	I know . It's going to save me a lot of money , I hope .
__label__noemo	Good evening , madam . May I help you ?
__label__joy	It ’ s my pleasure . Would you like another glass of champagne ?
__label__noemo	They come to the earth ?
__label__noemo	Bring your ID card and fill out a form . That will be fine .
__label__noemo	Sure , I have . Will you join ?
__label__noemo	Oh , right . You ’ re in our system . I was just looking under Li . So , we ’ Ve got you down for a Business Suite for three days . If I could just have your credit card , I ’ ll process your check-in while
__label__noemo	Yes . I used to be the monitor of my class .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__noemo	Mr . Brown , are your children always kicking up a row like this ? I cannot concentrate on my paper .
__label__noemo	Yes , good luck , Maria .
__label__noemo	This is our Submission of Tender which includes the information about volume of the project , the cost and so on .
__label__noemo	At the Hilton hotel .
__label__joy	OK.Goodbye .
__label__noemo	Both Bob and carl will become somebody in the future.Don ' t you think so ?
__label__joy	Fine ! I'll reserve a table for two at 8 pm , sir . May I have your name , please ?
__label__noemo	OK , no problem . I hope there are no questions about the terms .
__label__noemo	It is a bit lower than I expected . But I can accept that . What are the working hours ?
__label__noemo	You ’ re welcome . Feel free to ask me any time you need help .
__label__noemo	I'm a clerk in a shop .
__label__noemo	Yes . But those are the rush in that moment . And my boss ask me to do some urgent letters .
__label__noemo	Sure , do you think you could live out here ? You know , back to nature at all ?
__label__noemo	OK ! Do we need any meat ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , he , with his fleet , came across the Indian Ocean , and arrived at the east coast of Africa .
__label__joy	It's my pleasure . We hope you'll visit Beijing again .
__label__noemo	You know , I'm a pretty laid-back person . I don't like to have lots of arguments or worry about lots of things . For example , I like to keep the apartment clean too , but if it gets a little dirty once in a while , that's not a big deal .
__label__noemo	May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Why ? You're not fat .
__label__noemo	Please tell him I'll call him at the office tomorrow afternoon .
__label__noemo	I think modern painting means nothing .
__label__noemo	You can't judge a book by its cover .
__label__noemo	I didn't think you would be interested .
__label__noemo	I guess I need all of them .
__label__noemo	Yes , I would . ( After testing )
__label__noemo	I'm not really in the mood for dancing , actually . You know what ? I just feel like staying home tonight and vegging , after all . How about you ?
__label__surprise	Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ?
__label__noemo	Oh , today's International Labour Day . Is it our working day ?
__label__noemo	I must have slept right through it .
__label__noemo	I did that .
__label__noemo	What's up ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I knew I could do that . Exactly how do I go about selling them ?
__label__joy	Welcome to our university ’ s fifties anniversary , Sir . Please have a seat .
__label__disgust	I said , This is Pauline's mother . Please don ’ t telephone my daughter again !
__label__noemo	Diana , in your opinion , which is more important , IQ or EQ ?
__label__joy	Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though .
__label__noemo	Sure it is . So you'd better get rid of this idea .
__label__noemo	Cardiopulmonary resuscitation !
__label__sadness	So do I .
__label__noemo	You were right , it was from a headhunter . He wouldn't tell me anything without a signed contract .
__label__noemo	OK.Why don't you just hold the ladder , and I'll put it up .
__label__noemo	Miss Li . Li Lin .
__label__noemo	I don't think we have very much money for supplies , but we have a little .
__label__noemo	You are what you eat , and a healthy diet creates a body resistant to disease .
__label__noemo	Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ?
__label__noemo	I was impressed that you tried the pig's feet . I heard that many foreigners don't like to eat them .
__label__noemo	That proves my point ! Protect yourself or you'll get burned .
__label__noemo	Can I pay with traveler's check ?
__label__noemo	No , outside food is not permitted .
__label__noemo	Your luggage is two pounds over , I am afraid there'll be an excess luggage charge , sir .
__label__noemo	Thank you . Do you have some other colors ?
__label__joy	That sounds not bad at all . I'll take it .
__label__noemo	Have you a bus tour round the city ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me.Have you got any books on genetic engineering ? I've looked for them everywhere , but I can't find any .
__label__noemo	Is that what you really think ?
__label__noemo	I graduated from it in 2002 .
__label__noemo	I don't like going to the theatre .
__label__joy	OK , Mum . I'll invite my friends home .
__label__anger	Could you please stop flipping the channels ?
__label__noemo	I will be voting tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Not much .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t see why not .
__label__noemo	What did he do for restoring the Olympics ?
__label__noemo	Is it salty ?
__label__noemo	Good morning , Mr . Zhang .
__label__noemo	That's pretty much the same as I've been quoted at other banks .
__label__joy	I ’ m pretty happy living there .
__label__noemo	Alright . We can go later then .
__label__noemo	it was over food . I simply wanted some fried chicken but she said no .
__label__sadness	They're picking a name ... It's ... Darryl from marketing ! Rats !
__label__noemo	That's a good idea . We can improve our technology to meet your special need .
__label__noemo	Well , I think that one fits me better . What's the price ?
__label__noemo	How do I take the sucking lozenges ?
__label__noemo	I graduated from Peking University .
__label__noemo	Well , there are a lot of storybooks upstairs in our children's section . Some are written for young children , others for teens . Maybe some of them will suit your needs .
__label__noemo	You should try to put your best foot forward , and be careful of your personal appearance . At least you should get yourself dressed up . Appearance isnt everything , but it's the first thing an interviewer notices about you .
__label__noemo	It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday .
__label__joy	Well , I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . Anyway , I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave .

__label__noemo	I want to effect payment under an L / C today .
__label__noemo	In London.Where do you live ?
__label__noemo	Could you tell me something about safety deposit box rental , please ? I need somewhere safe to keep some insurance documents ; I just simply don't feel comfortable keeping them at home or in the office .

__label__noemo	Good morning.My name's Pat Green .
__label__joy	Sure . I'll do it after lunch . What length do you need ?
__label__noemo	Could you tell me something about your English education ?
__label__noemo	Well , I have to take all the fundamental course , plus a few from my major .
__label__noemo	Goodbye .
__label__noemo	What classes do you plan on taking ?
__label__joy	I hear that you are going to participate in the dinner party tonight.Seen from what you are dressing , you really look like a fox .
__label__noemo	I don't think so . Did you ever go and look at your stamp ?
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__joy	Would you care to join for the picnic tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	I want some kind of dessert .
__label__noemo	So she isn't causing you any problems ?
__label__noemo	Do you know much about computers ?
__label__noemo	Yes . Definitely stay in the class . You will get a better grade than your test scores . He does that deliberately to make all the students study a lot .
__label__noemo	I didn't expect to see you at this hour . You must have goofed off again .
__label__noemo	That will be it for now .
__label__noemo	All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency .
__label__noemo	Exactly , I overheard a manager scold his employee in the elevator this morning , they were from the company on the 12th floor , I guess . They were only three of us in the elevator , I felt very embarrassed to be in the middle of them .
__label__surprise	Oh , a cat ? Come on .
__label__joy	Great idea ! Here we go !
__label__noemo	He said he saw my job-seeking information on the Internet , and could offer me an appropriate job .
__label__noemo	For most of the articles in the catalog , we have good supply .
__label__noemo	On their bus or in your own cars , and you won't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region .
__label__noemo	"And lots of "" Dear Abby "" sob stories ..."
__label__anger	You can ’ t do that ! It ’ s illegal !
__label__noemo	We have roast chicken , grilled chicken , chicken curry and chicken chops .
__label__noemo	I see . What is your baggage ? And do you remember the tag's number or color ?
__label__noemo	No , thanks all the same .
__label__noemo	I think we'll need more time than the schedule gives us .

__label__noemo	How long will you be staying in China ?
__label__surprise	Really ? Do I look happy all the time ?
__label__joy	No , there ’ s no need . Thank you all the same .

__label__noemo	I do this every year .
__label__noemo	Asking her father in front of her . How do you think she will react ?
__label__noemo	don't worry.You won't be sitting there by yourself .
__label__noemo	I think you've got a cold .
__label__noemo	Take care ! Don't slip down to the ground .
__label__noemo	Your name , please .
__label__noemo	Which school are you attending ?
__label__noemo	Have you a pattern in your mind ?
__label__noemo	And your stereo too . So what did he steal ? We have to go look upstairs .
__label__noemo	As in many countries , there ’ s been a big growth in anything related to computers . Young people are attracted to that field in particular . There ’ s also been a big growth in education .
__label__noemo	And stay in the shallow area . I don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier .
__label__noemo	We are looking for a bilingual secretary . Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English ?
__label__joy	Sure .

__label__noemo	that ' for sure but very few .
__label__surprise	You did ? Wow ! Where did you learn ... ?
__label__noemo	You have a very good taste , sir . Would you like to try it on ?
__label__noemo	People don't usually tip here , but you can.Fifty dollars should be more enough .

__label__noemo	Room 1019 , tomorrow at seven thirty . Ok , we will give you a call in the morning .
__label__noemo	No , it's a Monday .

__label__joy	Thanks . I'm so excited . We've been trying for 8 months now .
__label__noemo	Yes , your laptop is on the chair .
__label__joy	Good idea .
__label__anger	I am really looking forward to getting away from you . Far away from you !
__label__noemo	are your ready to go to the supermarket ?
__label__noemo	T112 to Washington please .
__label__noemo	You look so busy .
__label__noemo	Not at all . I was born in Madrid , but I came to the States when I was a teenager .
__label__noemo	No . 10 % is my last word .
__label__joy	Don't be shy . Have some more chicken .
__label__noemo	You'd better ask for suggestions from a career counselor , and then make a decision .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	No . For me right now , the important thing is spoken Chinese . I need practice . So you could tutor me in speaking.We could use my textbook , and you could ask me questions.Then you could correct my mistakes .
__label__noemo	The volume is too loud . Would you kindly turn it down a little bit ?
__label__anger	Yes , he used to be . But now he ’ s drifting off track .
__label__noemo	Could you tell me where the cereal is ?
__label__noemo	Are you laughing at me ?
__label__noemo	Last weekend , while they were on the Sik trip .
__label__noemo	Not too bad . It is seemingly too hard for me to find a place for our date .
__label__noemo	Hi Ricky . Are you a new student here ?
__label__noemo	did they take his license away ?
__label__noemo	I see . My niece just flew back from Australia to visit . She ’ s got jetlag now . she ’ s just resting today , but we ’ ll probably go out somewhere tomorrow .
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__noemo	We can cover ourselves with beer ! That way if they bite us , they ’ ll get drunk and fall asleep .
__label__noemo	This is Action 5 News reporter Sarah O ’ Connell reporting live from Washington , D . C . where a protest has broken out . Thousands of angry citizens are protesting against the proposed bailout of the auto manufacturing industry ! Sir , sir , Sarah O ’ Connell , Action 5 news . Can you tell us what ’ s happening ?
__label__noemo	Have a great trip .
__label__noemo	Anything else , sir ? Should I check the water and the oil ?
__label__noemo	I think Applied Sociology is a practical subject that can be widely applied to research on soci-ety and man . Hence , I chose it as my major .
__label__surprise	Really , I went to Munich last week .
__label__noemo	maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they
__label__noemo	Will you be checking any bags today .
__label__noemo	Fine , we will take an actual look at your kitchen before start working on it .
__label__noemo	Yes . Behind a lifestyle , there is a culture . Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life . While they may not really like coffee , they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish with money in those high-consumption places .
__label__noemo	I studied at Anshan University .
__label__noemo	Do you like him ?
__label__noemo	You have to get up and get ready for school .
__label__noemo	Did you have the room checked before we move in ?
__label__joy	Not a bad idea !
__label__noemo	Yes . This big one is badly decayed . I'm afraid it must be taken out .
__label__noemo	do you feel ok ?
__label__joy	Great . I can ring you up over here . It comes to $ 87.04 .
__label__noemo	well , the north of Norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . It ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter .
__label__noemo	Sometimes . But I'll never forget the game in which our Chinese Women's Volleyball Team won the World Cup . It is the most thrilling and exciting game I have ever seen .
__label__noemo	Let's see , I've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend . I can only spare about $ 20 . I would give you more if I had it , I just don't have much money to my name right now .
__label__noemo	What's your favorite TV Program ?
__label__joy	I will . Good luck with your volunteering .
__label__noemo	That's true , but it must not be allowed to stand long .
__label__noemo	Then I will take your picture for your passport .
__label__noemo	Good . Sorry to have troubled you so much , Miss .
__label__noemo	I surely did ! Ask the customer service counter if we can deposit our stuff there .
__label__noemo	Yes , we do . What kind of room would you like ?
__label__noemo	Yes , sir .
__label__joy	I've said you will enjoy your life here !
__label__joy	You're so thoughtful . Wish you a good trip home . And we'll miss you .
__label__noemo	Air freight is the quickest and safest way , I think .
__label__joy	Your knowledge of English is really surprising .
__label__noemo	What should I write except these ?
__label__noemo	Trust me . I've been driving for two years .
__label__noemo	I'm the hazardous one here . I made three people fall over !
__label__noemo	But you should make up your mind first .
__label__joy	They're all waiting for you . Let's join them . I'm going to cut the cake soon .
__label__noemo	Then why are you wearing black shoes ?
__label__joy	That ’ s a good idea . It must be easy to find a job in shanghai .
__label__noemo	I think they have pretty good programmes . But I'll change it if you really want .
__label__noemo	Well , they're for your wife , so I think you should give her roses .
__label__noemo	Why do you buy stocks , then ?
__label__noemo	Are you going swimming again this afternoon ?
__label__noemo	I think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet , humankind will not become extinct .
__label__joy	Thank you for encouraging me . There are problems cropping up here and there . But I will over come them one by one .
__label__noemo	Do you know which account you want to take the money from ?
__label__noemo	Well , I'm afraid Thursday is out for me . I'm expected to attend a meeting of our personnel committee , and it's very important for me to be there .
__label__joy	Davis .
__label__surprise	Why ?
__label__noemo	Maybe we all will be all things to all men .
__label__noemo	So wearing a scarf helps your body to stay warm inside your jacket .
__label__noemo	What time is it ?
__label__noemo	Can you skillfully operate the computer ?
__label__noemo	I think it should be more useful to hand out some fliers which is also cheaper .
__label__noemo	Is a shop there ?
__label__noemo	Good afternoon , sir . Please sit here .
__label__noemo	I've tried , but she keeps pushing my buttons .
__label__joy	It's a good day for a picnic .
__label__disgust	He's lazy . I tried being a good host , but if you give him an inch , he'll take a mile .
__label__anger	I envy her and also I hate her at the same time .
__label__joy	I see . Well , thank you very much for helping me . You have been very helpful .
__label__noemo	I wish I had a chance to see it with my own eyes .
__label__noemo	Don't worry about that.We have experience .
__label__noemo	That's OK . But that must be costly .
__label__noemo	That will be soon enough , but make sure you get next week's assignment in as well , all right ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it ’ s L8V 4B7 .
__label__noemo	That sounds fine to me .
__label__noemo	Which terms ?
__label__noemo	No , that's all .
__label__noemo	What about that one ?
__label__noemo	Well , the weather is so unpredictable this time of year .
__label__joy	I think this suit fits perfectly .
__label__noemo	If a customer is interested in some certain goods , he can ask the web company to have the specimen of the goods shown on the color screen , and then the customer can place an order online to the sales company . And then the goods you want will be delivered to your home . The service is perfect and the delivery is free of charge .
__label__noemo	Jack wonders whether Linda likes him or not .
__label__noemo	I don't know really . What's the fashional color this year ?
__label__noemo	She's Betty.She ' s Mr Goldman's niece .
__label__noemo	Four . They are production department , finance department , sales and marketing department and HR department . I directly report to Mr . White . He is on a business trip and is suppose to be back this morning . Probably you will be meeting him at lunch .
__label__noemo	That's tough . What does your wife think about this ?
__label__noemo	I can do that .
__label__noemo	Thank you so much .
__label__noemo	Hey , Mike . Can I ask you something ?
__label__noemo	Yes , Mr . Smith , when would you like us to call you tomorrow morning ?
__label__noemo	No problem . I have you appointment changed from tomorrow morning to tomorrow afternoon at one fifteen .
__label__joy	May I ask what the name is the girl ?
__label__surprise	Oh , my God , I forgot grandma's coming !
__label__surprise	That's the cutest little doll I've ever seen in my life !
__label__noemo	Do you think we should travel by bus or by train ?
__label__noemo	Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry .
__label__noemo	I work in a publishing house . How about you ?
__label__noemo	We do not allow any request for a loan against personal security . This is a common regulation . But we may consider it if you can provide a reliable guarantor .
__label__noemo	A good suggestion for you.You need a holiday .
__label__noemo	I think we can still talk .
__label__noemo	Where can I find information on this subject ?
__label__noemo	Good coming ! Welcome to J P Interior Design .

__label__noemo	Well spotted ! I actually had it cleaned twice , because it was so dirty . The rug is new . You remember my trip to china ? Well , I bought is there .
__label__noemo	No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .
__label__noemo	I also want to pack up my package . This is the notes .
__label__noemo	Right . That ’ s why doctor say AIDS prevention means cleanness .
__label__noemo	Because our contract says that you will live here for three years .
__label__noemo	What should a secretary do to prepare for a meeting ? Can you tell me a bit more about it ?
__label__noemo	First you must check in at Counter No . 4 .
__label__noemo	It's the Automatic Teller Machine .
__label__noemo	Yeah , but today he was really hyper . He even got on the monkey bars and then he went on to go on the swings for a half hour . I'm exhausted !
__label__noemo	Yes , we have .
__label__noemo	I think you ’ re right about that . I ’ d need a good manager to be my spokesperson . I could do a lot of charity work , which would help a lot of people .
__label__joy	Who knows , maybe one day he will sit on the desk of a top CEO in a major corporation !
__label__noemo	Yes . It ’ s only 5 minutes walk from the campus .
__label__noemo	Are you going to cook anything ?

__label__noemo	Excuse me , I'm a little lost . Which bus do I take to get to Shi Da ?
__label__noemo	But you should pay special attention to your words and attitudes .
__label__joy	I love it ! Darling , you ’ re kind .
__label__noemo	No , hiking boots . Brown ones .
__label__noemo	Have you seen the sales report for last quarter ? Who do you think is our digest threat ?

__label__joy	You seemed to be dull at that time .
__label__noemo	Steven , what's the expense of moving house ?
__label__noemo	Yes . And he is the president of the company .
__label__noemo	I would like to buy some local handcrafts as gifts to my friends and relatives .
__label__noemo	Instead of walking you can take this shuttle to get you there faster .
__label__anger	If you want to cross here , be my guest . I don't feel like dodging cars and scooters !
__label__noemo	How about this afternoon ?
__label__noemo	Please fill out this exchange form and I'll need to see your passport . Don't forget to sign your name at the bottom .

__label__noemo	Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ?
__label__noemo	What position ?
__label__noemo	How much shall I pay ?

__label__joy	Yeah , I will . See you then !
__label__noemo	Well , she was a very good employee and we wanted to keep her , so her supervisor called her in for a chat and laid it on the line for her . She got the idea and now she saves the trendy styles for evenings and weekends .
__label__noemo	Have you been registered yet , sir ?
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	What a shame !
__label__noemo	Chicken , please .
__label__noemo	Do you have any plans for further study ?
__label__noemo	Hey , don ’ t walk on the lawn .
__label__noemo	It was my pleasure . How about this evening ? I feel very hungry now .
__label__noemo	Inform my members to prepare for the travelling . And then we can discuss about the travelling costs .
__label__noemo	And could you tell me what other jobs you have had ?
__label__noemo	Well , I prefer filet , but porterhouse is good , too .
__label__noemo	Can you finish your homework in ten minutes ?
__label__noemo	May I know who's calling ?
__label__noemo	Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ?
__label__noemo	Bye .
__label__anger	But nobody uses Macintosh !
__label__noemo	Yes . Oh ! And these two carry-ons .
__label__noemo	What have you been doing ?
__label__noemo	You don't look too well . What's going on ?
__label__noemo	It's a great honor to have you here , Mr.Brown .
__label__noemo	Yes , we are almost ready to order .

__label__surprise	My goodness ! It ’ s the afternoon ? Doesn ’ t the time fly ! Do come in and sit down .
__label__noemo	All right .
__label__noemo	How much is it to rent an economy car ?
__label__noemo	I must tell you that because your banking has been such a large amount , you need to wait until you leave the country to get any currency back .
__label__noemo	What about Wi-fi ?
__label__noemo	My parents just didn't handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . They think that it's important that I should learn how to live on my own .
__label__joy	Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening.Would you like to come with me ?
__label__noemo	my father wanted me to become a doctor , but I knew it would be impossible for me to be successful in that field .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , can you tell me where central Park Street is ?
__label__joy	I hope you will ! Take your time . We have a lot more upstairs .
__label__noemo	15 years .

__label__noemo	Yeah , is that all ?
__label__noemo	Do you think the plane will leave without me ?
__label__noemo	A reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company . Any extended illness will be covered by insurance . Have you read the other terms of the contract ?
__label__noemo	Mom , I don't want to bathe today .
__label__noemo	I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .

__label__noemo	Yeah . I am on edge since she was out to the match .
__label__noemo	What can I do for you today ?
__label__noemo	Maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you .

__label__noemo	Doctor , can you give me some suggestions on how to stay healthy ?
__label__joy	How do you think about her ?
__label__noemo	Would you be interested in an exchange as opposed to a refund ? I think I can help you to find the appropriate size .

__label__noemo	All right . I'm prepared to , if the pay is reasonable .
__label__noemo	We'll have to discuss it with my boss .
__label__noemo	Where is the baby ’ s mother ?
__label__noemo	May I help you with something ?
__label__noemo	"How about "" As long as You Love Me "" ! You can pretend you're singing it to your fiancee Brooke !"
__label__noemo	Right Rebecca . Now I see that after graduating from University your first job was ...
__label__noemo	Good answer , Miss Zhang-good answer ! Seriously , though , are you interested in staying in a staff-level position , or would you hope to move into management someday ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I'm fond of playing the chess and I'm very keen on playing cards .
__label__noemo	Mommy , dinner , please !
__label__anger	Yeah ! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor .
__label__noemo	Which one is hers ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry , Sir . She's currently away at our sub-branch . Is there anything I can help you with ?
__label__noemo	Is it all right for me to come in now , Mr Sun ?
__label__surprise	Oh , it costs too much . It's more expensive than the public school .
__label__joy	Linda , thank you for this wonderful Christmas dinner . I really enjoyed it .
__label__noemo	The average grade of all my courses is above 85 .
__label__noemo	I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply .
__label__noemo	You mean we'll share the taxi ?
__label__noemo	Normally , about 60 people . But it may depend .
__label__noemo	He must be mad ! Nick is a loan shark .
__label__noemo	International Air Braking Systems .
__label__noemo	I do.We haven't watered them for quite a few days .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t know . The ones who stole my uncle ’ s motorcycle were pretty good .
__label__noemo	I think they are too far from the stage . I want two in row 6 .
__label__joy	That's wonderful . I will see the Old Faithful for myself .
__label__noemo	Do you know what to get ?
__label__noemo	We'll get there around 7:45 in the morning .
__label__noemo	How often must I take it ?
__label__noemo	People think it's funny .
__label__joy	So you are happy that you made the decision to join us .
__label__noemo	That's great . Thank you for making this concession . I accept .
__label__noemo	Yeah , you are right . Let's stand . It takes only about 20 minutes .
__label__noemo	I would think this was the least they could do .
__label__noemo	Oh , so he ’ s half Chinese and half American . That ’ s unusual . What languages does he speak , then ?
__label__noemo	Ready for the big switch .
__label__joy	It's cool .
__label__noemo	I report the social news which means I always interview the citizens of various professions and trades .
__label__noemo	No , it's just a couple of minutes .
__label__noemo	I must catch the nine-thirty Train .
__label__noemo	Only one night .
__label__noemo	Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
__label__joy	OK , boy . I will buy it for you .
__label__surprise	Really ? Did you find any information about a new job ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I see how this food can be really hard for you . I can sympathize with that . I stayed in Sichuan for a year . The food was difficult at the beginning . Every dish was so spicy . After a while though , I got used to the taste , and now I won't consider anything a real dish if it isn't spicy .
__label__noemo	My room is facing the swimming pool . It ’ s noisy for me . I have a problem sleeping . And I feel uncomfortable when I take an elevator .
__label__fear	He followed me all the way home !
__label__noemo	No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park .
__label__noemo	I've gotten a few parking tickets before .
__label__joy	That's kind of cool . But what's the trick mean ?
__label__noemo	so , have you seen all three The Lord of the Rings movies ?
__label__noemo	Not for me , Dick .
__label__noemo	Doctor Lin's Office .
__label__noemo	Yes , madam ? Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	global warming is wreaking havoc everywhere .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , sir ? I ’ m afraid this is a no-smoking area .
__label__noemo	I hope I can adapt to the new job as soon as possible .
__label__joy	Look , I need another drink . Do you want one ?
__label__noemo	Which credit card are you speaking of ?
__label__noemo	Will that be all , sir ?
__label__joy	Yes . I got very excited .
__label__noemo	You're glad he saved me , huh ?
__label__joy	What a great weekend that was !
__label__noemo	Why this happens to me when I am on the plane ? I feel bad .
__label__noemo	It's OK , don't worry , we'll just choose a wine from the cooler . We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here , but ... this Rhone Valley white would be lovely .
__label__noemo	OK , I will send them to you soon .
__label__noemo	All right . Keep you receipt . If something comes up , you can show it to us and we will give you a refund .
__label__noemo	You ’ re welcome . Have a nice trip .
__label__joy	It's wonderful to be in the mountains after a hustle bustle week .
__label__noemo	Yes , I told him that you were very ill and couldn't attend .
__label__joy	These postcards are great . I want to buy a dozen with different pictures .
__label__noemo	How many carats would you like it to be ?
__label__joy	So we must seize this chance to go the beach .
__label__noemo	Do you speak English ?
__label__surprise	you said you were only going to window shop !
__label__noemo	What kind would you like to open ?
__label__noemo	How are you finding your new boss ?
__label__noemo	Oh . Have you finished listing your study preferences ?
__label__noemo	( A stranger stops to help ) Everything OK ?
__label__noemo	That makes sense . But that sounds interesting . Is there one in Beijing too ?
__label__joy	We're lucky today .
__label__noemo	Of course , how can I help you ?
__label__noemo	What's the matter with you , then ? You look miserable .
__label__noemo	Elvis Presley . Don't you recognize his voice ?
__label__joy	Great . We'll go and have a try . Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	No , thank you . I don't like soup . I'd rather have some fruit juice to start with .
__label__anger	You mean the line over there of about 200 people ? !
__label__noemo	I want to have it the size of a page from an ordinary book .
__label__noemo	Me too . But I tell myself that if they don ’ t accept me , another school will .
__label__noemo	How about printing a warning on each cigarette packet ?
__label__noemo	Next monday . Bring your resume and diploma with you .
__label__noemo	It was 10 hours .
__label__noemo	There , on the window .
__label__noemo	Hello !
__label__noemo	Okay ...
__label__noemo	Who is on duty ?
__label__noemo	Is there anything you want to ask about ?
__label__noemo	I need a taxi , please .
__label__noemo	You can come in and renew them unless someone else has reserved them .
__label__noemo	Actually , five and a half . On Saturday , we have classes only in the morning .
__label__noemo	OK . Can I see the room now ?
__label__joy	Here you are . Thank you and have a nice evening .
__label__noemo	Perfect ! This package includes round-trip flights to New Hampshire . A free airport pick-up is included . Our VIP limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger foods to soften the thirty-minute ride to the countryside .
__label__noemo	Maybe you ’ re right . It is very expensive to go to a weight-loss center . I ’ d better join in a fitness club .
__label__noemo	Yes , I was . I was almost an hour late .
__label__noemo	I tend to stick to fruits , vegetables , and chicken .
__label__noemo	Well , I would need an idea of how large your order would be . About how many units would you need ?
__label__noemo	Well , take it easy . Things will look better tomorrow . Maybe you should try exercising or a hot bath to help you relax .
__label__noemo	I want to remit 1,200 yuan to my brother in Nanchang .
__label__joy	8 it is . See you then .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__joy	That's quite a lovely weather .
__label__noemo	What are your main concerns ?
__label__noemo	No . I don ’ t think that ’ s possible . Some places are sure to be open .
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve been waiting for a response on the Blake Building design for nearly two weeks .
__label__joy	Not really . Her eyes are blue .
__label__noemo	You should get off at the first Shi Da stop .
__label__noemo	I love history , but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened .
__label__noemo	I can't accept your excuse . It's five o'clock .
__label__noemo	I needed to talk to you about your son .
__label__noemo	Can you give him a call on his mobile ?
__label__joy	Splendid .
__label__joy	Mr . Morris was so pleased with your sales work on his account that he went straight to the top with it . He wrote a letter about it to Mr . Macmillan !
__label__noemo	It's amazing to me how international business has become . Take my store for example . On any given day , you will find imported items from more than 20 different countries on our shelves .
__label__noemo	junk food is not good for your health . Too much of it will make you fat .
__label__noemo	Why are so many extra gifts left here ?
__label__noemo	How much cash would you like ?
__label__noemo	The ball is a different shape in rugby , isn ’ t it ?
__label__joy	Well , thanks , Bill . Let me know what happens . That extra money will really come in handy .
__label__joy	That was a great party . Thanks for staying behind to help me clear up .
__label__noemo	Are you in a hurry ?
__label__noemo	I need to know about the fees .
__label__noemo	Oh , now I understand ! So , you've already used up all your amenities ?
__label__noemo	Hey Sarah . Why are you limping ?
__label__noemo	You must feel terrible now .
__label__noemo	Bye !
__label__noemo	Would you show me some table-cloths ?
__label__noemo	Yes . Shall we buy some saucers ? It will be used during our picnic .
__label__noemo	Well , what ’ s the weather report ?
__label__noemo	About David , No , I didn ’ t hear anything .
__label__noemo	It seems that you will have a nice day tomorrow .
__label__surprise	It's a Chevrolet . Why do you ask ? You going into the car business ?
__label__noemo	Would you please put that cigarette out ? I get sick on it .
__label__noemo	Wait a minute , My uncle lives in Beijing and he lives very close to theatre . I ’ Ve telephone here and ask him to go to theatre to require it . We ’ d better have breakfast now . and meet him later .
__label__noemo	This dress is beautiful . May I try it on ?
__label__noemo	How far is this address from here , please ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s fine . Thank you .
__label__noemo	If so , counter Strike and Might & Magic are good alternatives . Counter Strike is one of the hottest shooting games and Might & Magic series are popular among girls because the game has attractive plot and interesting scenes .
__label__noemo	Mom , I don't feel well .
__label__noemo	No problem , Jenny . Are you sure five hundred is enough ?
__label__noemo	I am a grown-up , and I can stand on my own two feet .
__label__noemo	You don't mind , do you ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m reporting from Channel 5 News .
__label__noemo	I have taught myself Japanese in college , and I can carry on simple conversations in Japanese .
__label__noemo	Is This where I pay the airport tax ?
__label__noemo	A 15 - inch monitor is included in the deal . If you want , you can switch it for a 17 - inch monitor , for a little more money .
__label__noemo	Yes . I ’ Ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . The demand for phone cameras is growing , and Pear has been falling behind in the market .
__label__noemo	I'm going to work in a multi-national enterprise after graduation .
__label__noemo	Oh , I hope it be fixed on Friday .
__label__noemo	Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ?
__label__noemo	Not really . That ’ s pretty heavy metal .
__label__noemo	In that case , please help us reserve a table for 4 at 9:00 .
__label__noemo	Have you finished washing clothes ?
__label__noemo	You have to catch it going west .
__label__noemo	Yes , but ever since I bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so I ' Ve got to have it repaired .
__label__sadness	Sorry , I don't feel like playing . I have too much homework .
__label__noemo	Yes , that's quite all right for me . Can we change it ?
__label__noemo	So are Copernicus and many others .
__label__noemo	Never mind . You can leave them to me .
__label__noemo	But I also heard that coffee and its caffeine content , serve as a drug on the human body that negatively affects the central nervous system , as well as other organs , and leads to addiction
__label__noemo	What kind of jobs have you had ?
__label__noemo	Would you like to go to the cinema with me ?
__label__noemo	Oh , that ’ s the really bad news . Our supplier suffered QC problems and , well , half of our production is faulty . We ’ re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . And the worst part ? We ’ re going to have to shoulder this cost .
__label__noemo	well , this might be silly . But I just can't get him off my mind . And I can't help missing him .
__label__noemo	When am I supposed to start working ?
__label__joy	It is very kind of you . I'm so moved by you .
__label__noemo	See you .
__label__noemo	Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like ?
__label__noemo	What kind do you like ?
__label__noemo	There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet .
__label__noemo	Sure . But it is too cold today . I have to put on warm clothes and look stupid .
__label__noemo	You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying , you are a super negotiator .
__label__noemo	Maybe you should try to quit smoking . You know it is very bad for your health .
__label__joy	what do you mean ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it's one of the main air pollutants . Factories don't emit it directly into the air . It's actually formed when nitrogen oxides and VOC emissions come into contact with heat and sunlight .
__label__noemo	Our seafood is fresh . I recommend shrimp with garlic .
__label__noemo	Did you hear about the pilot ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea .
__label__noemo	You've take the words out of my mouth .
__label__joy	It's my pleasure . I think this pair of jeans will suit the sweater well .
__label__noemo	This pair is Rolex , right ?
__label__noemo	Taxi .
__label__noemo	I just felt that the paper couldn ’ t offer me any new opportunities . I really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
__label__noemo	It starts at 8 o'clock .
__label__noemo	Stolen ? No , why ?
__label__noemo	I'm not sure .
__label__noemo	I can't believe it . But if you both determine to divorce , I hope you will have an amicable split .
__label__noemo	No , I forgot to buy some .
__label__sadness	I know , but I am really sick .
__label__joy	And the people were so friendly !
__label__noemo	Straight on , and turn right . Is it far ?
__label__noemo	Fine , sir .
__label__sadness	I didn't sleep a wink last night .
__label__noemo	Yes.It ' s quite troublesome .
__label__noemo	Okay . Thank you .
__label__noemo	I wouldn't call myself introverted . Sometimes I enjoy being by myself very much . But other times I like sharing activities with others too .
__label__noemo	I plead not guilty .
__label__noemo	In my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . I think it ’ s about six minutes per hour .
__label__noemo	Very well . Thank you .
__label__noemo	Why don ’ t you find the information on the internet instead ?
__label__joy	I heard you're getting married , James . Congratulations !
__label__noemo	Use the number on the back of your library card .
__label__noemo	Du Tao . D-U for Du and T-A - 0 for Tao .
__label__noemo	The only thing I will need to see is your driver ’ s license , as I will be notarizing these papers .
__label__noemo	Why is that ?
__label__noemo	You would have to use the computer lab . I'm sorry for the inconvenience .
__label__surprise	But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?
__label__noemo	Why not ?
__label__noemo	The kids want a rabbit . I don ’ t think it would be a good idea to get a mouse or a fish ! That might be too tempting for our cat !
__label__noemo	When in Rome , do as the Romans do , they say .
__label__noemo	We're going to discuss how to market CB series soon . Does your project go well ?
__label__noemo	Please wrap it .
__label__noemo	I felt OK when I woke up , and then , suddenly , I had this really sharp pain .
__label__noemo	Do you want to watch it ?
__label__noemo	No , I ’ m serious .
__label__noemo	Did the looters get caught ?
__label__noemo	We could take a cut on the price if your order is a large one , but a 20 % reduction is really more than we can do . What quantity are you going to order from us then ?
__label__noemo	Oh . OK . I don't eat meat , but that's fine , I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ?
__label__noemo	You need to pay these fees soon .
__label__noemo	Tell me how much it will be , and I can tell you if it's okay .
__label__joy	How about a cold bottle of beer .
__label__noemo	No , PLS post the bill to 124 Hildrod Lane , Milton County , 98830 .
__label__noemo	At the new Five Spices restaurant in Chaoyang .
__label__noemo	I helped build the sets and find props for the plays . What about you ?
__label__noemo	Be careful .
__label__noemo	Another big step forward in saving on our office equipment , I don ’ t need a desktop anymore . A laptop is enough .
__label__noemo	Yes . I'm coming to confirm my ticket .
__label__noemo	Thanks . But I'm not so sure . Interviews stress me out .
__label__noemo	oh , really ? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren .
__label__noemo	I've got 6 packets of cigarettes and 2 bottles of champagne.Besides , I have two cameras , one is for my own use , and the other is a gift .
__label__noemo	It means he ’ s really badly injured , but he will almost certainly survive .
__label__joy	Yes . Thank you for inviting me .
__label__noemo	Don't worry about such problems . We can deal with them for you . Other questions ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to speak your export manager , please .
__label__noemo	I'm bleeding too much .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight .
__label__noemo	May I send food for him ?
__label__noemo	Charles Dickens ?
__label__joy	It was terrific.The concert was really a hit.The symphony orchestra was so good that I was completely absorbed in their performance .
__label__noemo	Of course , here is the catalogue and the price list . You can have a look . We also have many other kinds of carpets .
__label__noemo	What are you typing there ?
__label__noemo	It seems Americans are very passionate about sports . Is this just a part of your culture ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I am .
__label__noemo	Can we get in touch with you by e-mail ? Is this convenient for you ?
__label__noemo	Next Monday .
__label__joy	Sounds pretty good . Is it a tragedy ?
__label__surprise	You mean get married now ? On the plane ?
__label__noemo	Take it three times a day .
__label__noemo	No problem . Bye , bye .
__label__noemo	What are you going to do there ?
__label__noemo	I've just got Bean's new brand image . Let's make a T-shirt line with these pics .
__label__noemo	That's correct .
__label__noemo	But Ann ..
__label__anger	Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career !
__label__noemo	Would you like to go to a concert tonight ?
__label__noemo	It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out .
__label__noemo	The batteries are worn down . I need replace them .
__label__noemo	Three thousand dollars .
__label__noemo	Doesn ’ t sound like that ’ s be fun , then . Do you want to come here ?
__label__noemo	When can I have my trousers if I bring it to you tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I think so , If you want to graduated this year , you've got to take a science course .
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__noemo	what other kind of music do you listen to ?
__label__noemo	Put on the helmet , please .
__label__noemo	But she can ’ t be home now . She might have gone to the library .
__label__noemo	People decided to use the blackout to their advantage .
__label__noemo	Yeah , try not to kick or hit the computer !
__label__noemo	Please fill out this slip stating how much you wish to withdraw .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything .
__label__joy	Sounds very interesting . I'll buy some to family people .
__label__joy	Maybe I'll go there then .
__label__noemo	Are you ready to order , sir ?
__label__noemo	you really like brains that make you think , don't you ?
__label__noemo	I like yellow best . How much does it cost ?
__label__joy	You certainly made a good impression on me as well .
__label__noemo	How many countries have been affected ?
__label__noemo	Yes.If you don ’ t mind sharing room , there ’ s one available .
__label__noemo	What's your favorite dish or dishes ?
__label__joy	Thank you for your compliments.It ' s just that you are a good leader . Do you like the fox-trot and tango ?
__label__noemo	How about drinking soda ?
__label__noemo	Can we get tickets now ?
__label__noemo	What's the address ?
__label__noemo	Have a nice flight .
__label__noemo	Good coming . Are you through with the cleaning ? If not , we'll come back a little later .
__label__noemo	Thank you . You are so considerate .
__label__joy	Congratulations . How lucky you are !
__label__noemo	Yes , please sit on the chair.How do you want to have your hair cut ?
__label__noemo	Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss .
__label__noemo	Is the room ready for the lecture now ?
__label__noemo	No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ’ t even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party .
__label__noemo	Hello , is this housekeeper ?
__label__noemo	I went to a boxing match in the sports stadium .
__label__noemo	All right . I'II open this one .
__label__joy	What a good day !
__label__noemo	Do you have wool socks ?
__label__joy	Let ’ s take a few pictures so that we can remember what we like about this home .
__label__noemo	What about you ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I was elected Excellent Party Member for four academic years .
__label__noemo	Well , I haven't thought much about this . I think it's too early to tell . What is most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible .
__label__noemo	What do you think ?
__label__noemo	If one of them forgot a camera in a restaurant , would you let the tourist bus go back ?
__label__noemo	And , who is sponsoring your trip ?
__label__noemo	Oh , yes . I got so tired . My son began to cry the moment we got on the train . It was very embarrassing because we took the over-night train and the noise made it difficult for other people in the cabin to sleep .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'm good with people .
__label__surprise	Why ? What happened ?
__label__noemo	Oh , that's the only place where jeans are not popular . I'd better just go home .
__label__noemo	No . I'm still working on it .
__label__noemo	Well , it's a good thing for you .
__label__noemo	Are you using dial-up or broadband ?
__label__noemo	It s a little overpriced . Is there any discount on this laptop ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . You ’ Ve already decided , have you ? Now , you listen to me , you ’ re only 19 .
__label__noemo	You just put quarters in the machines.It ' s easy .
__label__noemo	He is really clear on what you need to learn to get a good grade . Are you willing to study hard ?
__label__noemo	It is in that brand new , tall building over there . On the 9th floor .
__label__joy	You ’ re welcome .
__label__noemo	Morning , Tom ! What are you doing over there ? Learning to dance ?
__label__noemo	I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ?
__label__noemo	Yes . The gas station is on the left . And you can't miss it .
__label__noemo	Of course , I will tell her .
__label__joy	Good mastery . How do you like our Chinese food ?
__label__noemo	What ’ s the time ? My watch has stopped .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , could you please show me the way to the human resource department ?
__label__noemo	How much is the service charge ?
__label__noemo	Did it cost very much
__label__joy	That ’ s a great idea . Which charities would you support ?
__label__noemo	Yes , a single , thanks .
__label__noemo	How ’ s it going ?
__label__noemo	May I be of any help ?
__label__noemo	Do you have any questions you want to ask ?
__label__noemo	Good . I'll be there at 12:30 .
__label__noemo	How do you think the report I wrote ?

__label__surprise	nobody exercises anymore-not even kids ! The average american home has the TV on for 6 hours a day !
__label__noemo	Do you have a good English-Chinese dictionary ?
__label__noemo	We have many kinds of different purpose . I wonder whom you are buying for ?
__label__noemo	Well , I'm already in this field and know most of the companies . Before I come in to fill out an application , I need to know who it's with so I know whether or not I'm willing to work with them .
__label__noemo	Is this your first time in Beijing ?
__label__noemo	All kinds of insects dress themselves up . They drive straight their own Flower Cars along the Parade Avenue of Ants Kingdom .
__label__joy	Home run by Okapi ! That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Richie Stadium !
__label__noemo	How's everything going ?
__label__noemo	Well , we could see something different like a detective film .
__label__noemo	Please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules .
__label__noemo	Thank you so much !
__label__noemo	OK , here is your permit ; enjoy the next semester .
__label__noemo	Oh , I know . I will try my best .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . Check please .
__label__noemo	I am going to buy a new air conditioner for my parents . Oh , it ’ s two o ’ clock . I must go now .
__label__joy	Fantastic ! I enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette .
__label__noemo	Well , they ’ Ve got the money and she ’ s going tomorrow for treatment .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry for hero .
__label__noemo	Yes , ma ’ am . How may I help you ?
__label__joy	Whole Foods is way better than Sons , trust me .
__label__noemo	Generally speaking , there are the company , the job title , job description , requirement , and so on .
__label__noemo	Did you have a good weekend ?
__label__noemo	9:45 , please . We want a table next to the window .
__label__noemo	That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony .
__label__joy	Thank you very much for your hospitality .
__label__noemo	Is the environment a big issues in your country ? It is in mine .
__label__noemo	No rush . You can give it back whenever you have it .
__label__noemo	I need to get home .
__label__noemo	But I still don't know which unit is in need of staff .
__label__noemo	You ’ re welcome . The rain is quite heavy , isn ’ t it ?
__label__noemo	Well , in fact it's fun for us to just be together that night and do this one thing .
__label__joy	That's a good idea . Let's go !
__label__noemo	I should have ?
__label__joy	Pretty good . Where are you going ?
__label__noemo	What're you so afraid of ? Just tell her what you're feeling about her .
__label__joy	Did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower .
__label__sadness	Oh , that's too bad . Should I call a doctor ?
__label__noemo	Oh dear . I wanted AUD . Is that not possible ?
__label__joy	It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great .
__label__noemo	Where is John ? I can't find him anywhere .
__label__noemo	How come ?
__label__noemo	I drive a scooter
__label__noemo	Oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ?
__label__noemo	But you should have told me you were in love with her .
__label__noemo	Well , my car won't start . I don't know what's the matter with it .
__label__sadness	Oh . I just can ’ t forget it .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things .
__label__noemo	I think the most important is that you need to show the employer that you are qualified for that job .
__label__noemo	Did you say that Ted was at your mercy ?
__label__noemo	Is there any difference ?
__label__noemo	Well-done , please .
__label__joy	Great .
__label__noemo	It was a good game , wasn't it ?
__label__noemo	Medium , please .
__label__noemo	Come on . I know Li Lin is there . Let me talk to her .
__label__noemo	How much do you need ?
__label__noemo	You got up so late today . You have , I think . Turn on the TV and set your watch by it .
__label__noemo	Well , I'm not quite ready .
__label__disgust	Three-but there was one of them who kept asking really stupid questions .
__label__noemo	From one to two .
__label__noemo	Yes , are you ?
__label__noemo	Let me see . Wash the cabbage over there .
__label__noemo	What I cannot put up with is that they may even give me a back talk .
__label__noemo	A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ?
__label__joy	Now we get along very well . It makes me feel that I'm someone special .
__label__joy	I am assuming that the dress is casual .
__label__noemo	Well , that happens . I hope she is all right .
__label__noemo	Would that be a Fixed Deposit or a Current Deposit ?
__label__noemo	I am so busy today .
__label__noemo	So how long do you plan to live here ?
__label__surprise	Wait ! Look at that board , what's on it ?
__label__noemo	That's right . Vince still stops by her office every day to thank her .
__label__noemo	I don't need to leave until the very end of class .
__label__noemo	I'll give you a blood test . Would you roll up your sleeve ? Just as I thought . You're anemic . You'd better pay more attention to your diet . Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein . And don't stay up late working . Try to get more rest .
__label__noemo	What are you talking about , we tried everything !
__label__noemo	Hello , could I make a reservation ?
__label__noemo	And for your entree ?
__label__noemo	Have you got any outdoor interests ?
__label__joy	Do you like it ?
__label__noemo	Administer is doing a good job . I'm not sure they'll be as happy as we are .
__label__noemo	Oh ! In our country the bride's family is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement , costs , etc . So the reception is held at her home .
__label__noemo	Right , then you'd better send an E-mail to tell her .
__label__surprise	Really ? They didn't give you one with your ticket ?
__label__noemo	Room Reservations . May I help you ?
__label__joy	A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you !
__label__noemo	Hi , Tom.Want a cup of coffee ?
__label__joy	Goodbye , then . Thanks again for everything .
__label__surprise	Really ? How much is it ?
__label__joy	No , thanks . I have had enough .
__label__noemo	How much is it ?
__label__noemo	I'm free . What's up ?
__label__joy	Right , drink as much as you can .
__label__noemo	They don't seem to have done much damage to the flat .
__label__noemo	Not bad . I heard you are going to graduate this coming summer , right ?
__label__noemo	Mr . Black has been getting a little on the side .
__label__noemo	Okay , I'm coming downstairs now .
__label__noemo	Would you like it rare , medium or well-done ?
__label__noemo	Hey , did you hear the news ?
__label__joy	Thank you.You ' re partial .
__label__noemo	What sort of job do you have in mind ?
__label__noemo	I ’ ll pay them off right now .
__label__joy	Yes , that is a lot of choices . What is your favorite ?
__label__joy	Sure , just a second . Who's calling ?
__label__noemo	My eyes water continuously . Why ?
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__joy	I appreciate that , thank you .
__label__noemo	But it seems that these talent shows are getting less popular these days . There's no such program on this year .
__label__noemo	Hello , may I have a double cheeseburger ?
__label__noemo	Where can I find the bus ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology .
__label__noemo	We are approaching the top of the mountain .
__label__noemo	Yes , madam , can I help you ?
__label__noemo	A moment please , sir . Yes , I can confirm 10 rooms for those days .
__label__noemo	Let me see . Yes , we still have four left .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'd like to try the blueberry pie .
__label__joy	Last week , It said that he fell in love with Jenny at Mrs.Whit ' s party last Monday as soon as he saw her .
__label__surprise	Oh , really ? That is great news . What does he look like ?
__label__noemo	Did your wife give birth yet ?
__label__surprise	That's amazingly low for such a huge accident !
__label__noemo	That's right .
__label__noemo	I think the Inspection Bureau at your end , when effecting inspection , only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard . The part that was not dried properly , most probably , escaped their attention . As the amount in question is only 20 % of the whole shipment , I think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss .
__label__noemo	From Zhongshan Circus to City Bank .
__label__noemo	Hello ?
__label__noemo	Are you going to go right away ?
__label__noemo	You'll have a definite answer from us within a week . Goodbye .
__label__noemo	I thought you knew where we get off at .
__label__joy	My pleasure.What a pity you have to leave so soon !
__label__noemo	Sprite with ice , please .
__label__noemo	Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for . Besides , I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes .
__label__joy	I was really glad to hear about your award . Congratulations !
__label__joy	We'll miss you . I hope we'll keep in touch .
__label__noemo	Why are you qualified for this position ?
__label__noemo	the rapidly expanding economy has encouraged many students to pack their bags AMD head for home .
__label__noemo	It ’ s a programme about islam . It ’ s very interesting .
__label__noemo	Tomorrow I will be the new owner of all dad's assets .
__label__noemo	Oh , I nearly forgot the exams .
__label__joy	OK . Thank you a lot .
__label__noemo	do you remember where you were for the terrorist attacks on 9-11 ?
__label__noemo	Yes , but it's blurred and a little dark .
__label__noemo	Oh , the bus is gone .
__label__noemo	Fine , what time do you want to get up ?
__label__joy	Jim is a genius . He gets along well with everybody and he can always get the work done .
__label__noemo	No , I know how to control my temper .
__label__noemo	Okay , let me see what I can do for you .
__label__noemo	Party all night ? Hotel California ? No kidding . Anyway , what's the room charge ?
__label__noemo	That's OK ! We'll take you to have a tour . Please follow me .
__label__noemo	But , you work with her everyday .
__label__noemo	Can you stand ?
__label__joy	thank you .
__label__noemo	He is in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
__label__noemo	Well , keep a low profile .
__label__noemo	Well , I prefer to go on the train , but I suppose you want me to take the car .
__label__joy	I think it will be very useful in many ways . Beside , shanghai is an important trade center , not only in China , but also in the world , English is useful in almost all walks of life .
__label__noemo	The interesting thing is that many of the teachers are not actually trained teachers . They are usually professionals who are taking a break from their jobs to pass on skills to others .
__label__noemo	Your front bumper is just as damaged .
__label__noemo	You can contact me any time you need me . Bye !
__label__noemo	I will fix it for you .
__label__noemo	Hi there . I need to change some dollars into local currency . Can I do that here ?
__label__noemo	don't be silly . You guys should spend as much time together as you can . Besides we can go to the beach anytime .
__label__noemo	Slacker and those who violate working principles .
__label__noemo	OK , we'll come at half past eleven tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Yeah , and they messed my order up too .
__label__joy	You are welcome .
__label__noemo	Hello sir , how can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Okay , I will try it on .
__label__noemo	What ’ s her name ?
__label__noemo	You are so not here ! His girlfriend is one of the cheer leaders .
__label__noemo	I ’ d like to pack my bags and leave tonight .
__label__noemo	Wow , you have a lot of questions ! I learned a lot . In fact , that ’ s why I am taking it again . I get lots of practice in speaking , and also in writing . I ’ m sure you ’ ll be glad you took this course . I ’ ll even help you study if you ’ d like .
__label__noemo	I ’ m very sorry I can ’ t .
__label__joy	How do you like fox-trot ?
__label__noemo	According to your schedule , you will visit the Times Company , including its office building , workshops and stores , in the morning from 8: 30 to 11
__label__noemo	That's why I think it may suit my needs .
__label__noemo	I thought you were the only child in the family . Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ?
__label__noemo	Please send up a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare .
__label__joy	Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
__label__noemo	A dessert sounds nice .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry to tell you that I have to cancel our appointment .
__label__noemo	Good morning , how are you doing today ?
__label__noemo	I just want to show my children how an American policeman looks .
__label__noemo	Isn't there anything else ?
__label__noemo	Premium or regular , Madam ?
__label__noemo	Well , let's see . Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time .
__label__noemo	How many languages can you speak ?
__label__noemo	All right . Come in on Friday at 11
__label__noemo	But I can't just slow down .
__label__joy	A beautiful center !
__label__noemo	sounds great . Are there many business opportunity ?
__label__noemo	I'm looking for a pair of white sports shoes to go with my jeans .
__label__noemo	All right , but I'm busy . How long will it be before you can finish the talk ?
__label__noemo	Which bus do I have to change ?
__label__noemo	Wow , this place is quite different from ten years ago when I first came to China .
__label__noemo	That's all right . I'm almost finished.Do you need my help ?
__label__noemo	I'm not sure , I feel hot and cold .
__label__noemo	Quite well . I made good records in college . I won the scholarship in every semester .
__label__noemo	No , you idiot . I mean the poet , Arthur Rimbaud - R , I , M , B , A , U , D .
__label__noemo	There's a lot to share when you have a common interest .
__label__noemo	No , they are filed according to dates .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ?
__label__noemo	It's a butterfly---everyone in her family has one .
__label__noemo	I'd like to buy some perform for my girlfriend .
__label__noemo	I am bilingual , English and Russian .
__label__joy	Have a nice weekend .
__label__noemo	I bet you that she regrets what she's done . You are such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn't she ?
__label__joy	Yes , beautiful weather we're having .
__label__noemo	It's 45132 .
__label__joy	Not at all . Welcome again .
__label__noemo	Don't worry . The traffic is smooth . You will be there in time for your flight .
__label__noemo	I will . Many thanks , Mr.Black .
__label__noemo	Heineken and Budweiser . We have a two-for-one happy hour special .
__label__noemo	I really do not have time to deal with some lovesick computer geek .
__label__noemo	He is five years older than me , He got married last Sunday.My brother and my sister-in-law are the same age .
__label__noemo	Oh , that is a shame . He is really hard working .
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__noemo	Yes , even her mother .
__label__noemo	Kitty's ? He sure gets around , doesn't he ?
__label__joy	That's right . His voice ranges from the smooth sound of ballads to the highpowered rhythms of the Spanish Caribbean where he grew up . He has fan clubs across the world , from America to Russia , from England to Taiwan , from Norway to Australia .
__label__noemo	To be honest , I have no idea about these things ! But I'm sure that's alright .
__label__noemo	Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired .
__label__noemo	Sending a message ' KTCTWY ' to 10086 will do .
__label__noemo	You speak good English , though .
__label__noemo	A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
__label__noemo	Let's order something to eat . What are you in the mood for ?
__label__noemo	That would be weird .
__label__noemo	The wei-ya is the one time a year you can make fun of the boss .
__label__joy	That ’ s great ! Do you have any plans ?
__label__noemo	That's insane .
__label__noemo	Yes , summer is coming .
__label__joy	Same here .
__label__noemo	Yes , someone give me a pamphlet introducing the restaurant and its business hours when I passed by this morning . So , let ’ s have a try . My treat .
__label__noemo	How would you like it ?
__label__joy	That's correct . We have four seasons of spring .
__label__noemo	I understand . That ’ s why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town , far from the city .
__label__fear	I'm dead serious about this , Sally .
__label__noemo	That is no problem at all . Isabel ’ s is having a clearance sale , and today is the last day . You don't want to miss such a good chance , do you ?
__label__noemo	All right , as a token of friendship , we accept your counter-offer .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over .
__label__noemo	Yes , show me your ticket and passport please .
__label__noemo	I have also got them ready for the lecture .
__label__noemo	How much do you think we should leave for a tip ?
__label__noemo	Well , I have a guest pass . Why don ’ t you come with me tonight ?
__label__noemo	That's all right . You can contact me later if you have other questions after you read the tender notice .
__label__joy	Take care ! Don't slip on the ground .
__label__joy	I admit it . I'm a wuss . I just can't do it in person .
__label__noemo	We propose to deliver 50 % in June and the balance in Aug .
__label__joy	The building is quite new and well constructed . I ’ m happy with the fittings too .
__label__noemo	It seems like it rains every time we plan a picnic .
__label__disgust	He's awful ! He telephoned me four times yesterday , and three times the day before yesterday . He telephoned the office yesterday morning and yesterday afternoon . My boss answered the telephone .
__label__noemo	It just happened to be the highest grade in the class .
__label__noemo	Here you are.It ' s 90 yuan , miss .
__label__noemo	I ’ m giving you some antibiotic and aspirin . Taking aspirin when you ’ Ve got a fever and take one antibiotic until four hours and go home lie in bed for two days . Take some water then you feel better .
__label__noemo	I see . And what loan amount are you expecting ?
__label__joy	Great ! Would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first ?
__label__noemo	Welcome , Mr . Sun .
__label__noemo	Stop beating around the bush . Will you quit or not ?
__label__noemo	By the way , do you know that our company just made some changes in the business trip policy ?
__label__noemo	Well.Good for him .
__label__noemo	I'm not sure . I was thinking of making a vegetable .
__label__noemo	No , thanks . How much in total ?
__label__noemo	You bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America .
__label__noemo	One more question , Do you have a trainer ?
__label__noemo	No , nothing special.Oh , yes , you know Bill , The guy with the moustache.His wife had a baby girl last night and he passed out cigars to everyone today , He said his wife and daughter are doing fine.The baby is their first child .
__label__noemo	All right , Bill.Here ' s your daily exercise schedule . You are to jog before breakfast .
__label__noemo	Well , thank you again for coming to see us.But just remember that we like people who join the company to play in the company sports teams .
__label__noemo	Would you like to go with me ? I ’ m afraid of the hospital .
__label__noemo	What time ?
__label__noemo	I said he was nothing but a yeoman .
__label__surprise	That sounds crazy . But they can't just change their mind about things like that .
__label__noemo	What is it ?
__label__noemo	It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to make a person-to-person call to Beijing , China . The number is 2135367 8 , and I want to speak to Mr . Zhang .
__label__noemo	No problem , sir . We will arrange you a table for 5 .
__label__noemo	thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ?
__label__noemo	Sure . We have a one-day trip along the river . It's quite beautiful .
__label__noemo	That ’ s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .
__label__noemo	What about next week ? Is it convenient for you ?
__label__noemo	It's August the thirteenth .
__label__joy	What's your favorite flower ?
__label__noemo	It's for my daughter who is still a senior high school student .
__label__noemo	Why have you decided to change jobs ?
__label__noemo	All right . Wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here .
__label__noemo	Good morning . I ’ m looking for a new jacket .
__label__noemo	I'd love to . But I am going to meet my girlfriend right now . See you later .
__label__noemo	Let me see .
__label__noemo	Wait , let me write this down ... Alright , I'm ready .
__label__noemo	Hello , Personal Banking . How may I help you ?
__label__noemo	That would be very nice . Thank you .
__label__noemo	Well , I just hope it'll level off .
__label__noemo	I've worked here as a sales representative for about a year now .
__label__joy	Of course.You look terrific in it !
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve been to most of the countries in Europe , several countries in asia , china , Japan , korea , and Thailand , and to the united states and Canada .
__label__sadness	Sorry , I can ’ t ! I have to go to work , pick up Jake and Maddie from school , and make them an afternoon snack , then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class .
__label__noemo	For now I want you to take a second drug , Lisinopril , an ACE inhibitor .
__label__noemo	She's in a meeting until noon .
__label__noemo	You're so old fashioned ! Nobody is going to pull down your pants !
__label__noemo	I finished it all .
__label__noemo	Yes , sometimes .
__label__joy	Come on , Josh , don't be such a chicken . If you like her , you've got to tell her . Maybe she likes you .
__label__noemo	so do I .
__label__noemo	what do you use to eat it ?
__label__noemo	yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go .
__label__noemo	Yes , Ma'am . No magazines during the office hours . I'm sorry .
__label__noemo	At present , both are OK for me.What do you need most , then ?
__label__noemo	Not yet . But I wonder if I can get my parents ’ consent .
__label__noemo	My parents live by themselves now . When they get older , they ’ ll probably go to a retirement home . Do you just have one brother ?
__label__noemo	OK , see you next time .
__label__noemo	What happened ?
__label__noemo	Pineapple Computer Company . A secretary is needed there , and it is worth a try . Do you get any information or advertisement for employment ?
__label__noemo	What ’ s wrong with the check ?
__label__joy	That's a good idea.What time is good for you ?
__label__noemo	Airport security.Could you empty your pockets over here , please ?
__label__noemo	No .
__label__noemo	Job fairs are popular places to look for work .
__label__noemo	It says here that most of the people are han Chinese , but there are 55 minorities that make up almost 10 % of the population .
__label__noemo	I'm catching the eleven o'clock train .
__label__joy	Private collectors ! They must have excellent collections . I'II go and see each of them . What kinds of collections can I see ? Come on , don't keep me in suspense !
__label__noemo	Well , it pays off for her.How old is she anyway ?
__label__noemo	They can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more.that ' s because they rely on gadgets .
__label__noemo	What are you most nervous about ?
__label__joy	Certainly . Four more stops after this . I ’ ll call out the stops .
__label__noemo	What kind of benefits are we talking about ?
__label__noemo	That's no problem . It is made of linen , so you won't feel hot in it . I can assure you it is of superior quality . What is more , it is very popular with young women .
__label__noemo	I've just got the examination results . I am afraid you haven't passed .
__label__noemo	Where do you see yourself five years from now ?
__label__joy	Gorgeous ! There is another song combining Chinese and western music styles . I am crazy for it , so I hear it over and again . And I plan to make it as the ringbone of my mobile .
__label__noemo	I know that . I met her last week , and she looked as pale as death .
__label__noemo	No problem . How much ? If I don't have enough on me , I'll pop over to the ATM and draw some .
__label__noemo	Thanks .
__label__noemo	No , please , Mom ! Don't make me gargle with saltwater !
__label__noemo	Would you hold on a second , please ? Miss Cooper's extension is engaged .
__label__noemo	Please do .
__label__noemo	Fine .
__label__noemo	I can ’ t decide what to do today .
__label__noemo	And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . My father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day .
__label__noemo	Not really , perhaps just a translation problem , that's all . Anyway , we've agreed to accept it .
__label__noemo	Honda is OK .
__label__noemo	Why don't you like horror ? They're entertaining .
__label__noemo	Do you like shopping ?
__label__noemo	I don't know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive .
__label__noemo	I suppose that the assembling of these components and parts , particularly the marketing of the finished products should take place in China .
__label__noemo	Yes , my engine warning light is on .
__label__noemo	Why are you laughing ?
__label__noemo	I took a cooking class at the Culinary Institute .
__label__noemo	Hi , is this Sue ?
__label__noemo	That's easy . It's .. er . Venus . NO . Pluto . No . Wait a minute . It's Anthe tip of my tongue . Oh dear , what is the nearest planet to the sun ?
__label__noemo	I hope you can stay for dinner . I need a guinea pig !
__label__noemo	Yes . Here is your boarding pass .
__label__noemo	I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . Also , find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles , and that the place is hygienic .
__label__noemo	Well , I guess so .
__label__noemo	I'd like it medium-well .
__label__noemo	If the weather is good , I'll go to climb mountains .
__label__noemo	Yes , we'll need to fill in this form , for fund trading and this one , for subscribing for and / or applying for purchasing fund units . The minimum is 500 RIB .
__label__noemo	what do you think is going to happen ?
__label__noemo	How are you , Sue ?
__label__noemo	Did they take good care of you in the hospital ?
__label__noemo	I don't think so . In Korea some marriages break up , but most couples stay together .
__label__joy	To some extent , he is . And what do you think we move to a better place ? I can't see him clearly from here .
__label__joy	A nice quiet house is exactly what we're looking for .
__label__joy	No . But I am going to apply for some vocational schools . I like fashion design and want to study it .
__label__noemo	Oh , no . Carnations are not very elegant.Artificial flowers have no passion .
__label__noemo	I am not running after the fashion . I just want a very beautiful and clean kitchen .
__label__noemo	Fine , thank you.How are you doing this morning ?
__label__noemo	I want to transfer $ 100 .
__label__noemo	Your wet towel , sir .
__label__noemo	You haven't seen the sights yet , have you ?
__label__noemo	Sony please.Do you have extra charge for delivery ?
__label__joy	Great . My favorite-soup , soup , soup ...
__label__noemo	What about here in physical education ?
__label__noemo	I see , yes , I can do that now . I'm sure you know , as I may have told you before , you should pay an extra 20 RIB handling fee for this service .
__label__noemo	Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .
__label__noemo	It takes two to make a quarrel and it takes two to mend fences .
__label__noemo	Well , is there any other hotel nearby ?
__label__noemo	If you fail to do your work well , what are you going to do ?
__label__joy	That's for sure . You know , it's really amazing to be in the best concert hall , listening to the performance by the best orchestra . I had the greatest time ever .
__label__noemo	Yes , sure . It is No . 50 in the Fifth Avenue where there is a fairground and a museum .
__label__noemo	We're busy on weekdays , but we'll have a good rest at the weekend .
__label__noemo	Art isn ’ t for everyone . I ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture .
__label__noemo	there must have been some good news in the newspaper . I can ’ t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited .
__label__noemo	Stephen , can you work overtime tonight ?
__label__noemo	Well please , why don't you go ahead of me in line ? I'm in no hurry .
__label__joy	That's amazing . What tips did your trainer give you ?
__label__noemo	OK , thanks for checking . Could you give me a ring when it arrives , please ?
__label__noemo	They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Voters who often change the party they vote for are Calle
__label__noemo	Okay .
__label__noemo	Oh wow , there are a lot of sites .
__label__noemo	Yes and it is quite a big building so you won't miss it . There is also a small supermarket next to it .
__label__noemo	I'm going to the hospital to see Susan .
__label__joy	I really enjoyed tonight's party . Thank you , Sarah .
__label__noemo	And I bet you studied , too .
__label__joy	Thank you . It has always been my dream to be a stewardess .
__label__noemo	Sure , here they are .
__label__noemo	Should I take the bus ?
__label__noemo	I want to post this package to the United States .
__label__noemo	I wish you wouldn't play the TV so loud .
__label__noemo	Would you like a smoking or non-smoking room ?
__label__noemo	Mr . : Please open your books to page 10 . ( To Mary ) Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Did it spill on your clothes ?
__label__noemo	Can I print it ?
__label__noemo	You look a bit pale , don't you ?
__label__noemo	Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ?
__label__joy	Let's watch a movie or something .
__label__joy	Of course not ! We built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . We went sliding on the nice hill . It was a real work out . At noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . Fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . You must come with us next time . I bet you will love it .
__label__noemo	Eight tens , six ones and large silver for others .
__label__noemo	Size 36 . . . I think .
__label__noemo	What do you drink ?
__label__noemo	I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment .
__label__noemo	What will that tell me ?
__label__noemo	The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 .
__label__noemo	Broadway Mall is having a big sale this weekend . You wanna go ?
__label__noemo	How about this one ? It's on sale for only 35 dollars .
__label__noemo	What's the matter ?
__label__noemo	Well , I suppose it could be the gas .
__label__noemo	What ’ s your name ?
__label__noemo	I don't know the exact time . Maybe I lost it last night when I was traveling on the bus .
__label__joy	All right . Thank you .
__label__joy	He sounds hot ! What does he do for a living ?
__label__noemo	Is there anything I can do for you ?
__label__noemo	Hot in here , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	Can I get you something , coffee , tea ?
__label__noemo	I agree with you completely .
__label__noemo	Actually the general manager is regarded as a baby doll . He has much sympathy .
__label__noemo	I said , Bonjour !
__label__noemo	What does this have to do with me ?
__label__noemo	Don't you like it ?
__label__noemo	I'll just go and check for you .
__label__noemo	Stand on the chair , Pig Tom . Use your brain .
__label__joy	Bye .
__label__noemo	Not very expensive .
__label__noemo	OK . How much should I pay ?
__label__noemo	Sure . But it will be a long hike 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ?
__label__noemo	The weather is often quite different from the weather forecast .
__label__sadness	I'm not being pessimistic . I'm being realistic . My chemistry is so bad .
__label__noemo	I can ’ t help that .
__label__noemo	How happy you are ! I have to stay at home to prepare my final exam .
__label__noemo	You can keep these books for only half a month .
__label__noemo	How long will you be staying , sir ?
__label__noemo	then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path .
__label__noemo	It is ok . My boss briefs me later on .
__label__noemo	I had to look after my son at home .
__label__noemo	It costs 125 dollars a month .
__label__noemo	You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order .
__label__noemo	That's terrible . Unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service .
__label__noemo	Hi , I'm George . I'll be your waiter this evening . Are you ready to order or do you need a few more minutes ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much !
__label__joy	As long as it doesn't snow !
__label__noemo	I want to come in at 2
__label__noemo	I work for the Bank of China , in the International Section .
__label__sadness	I'm very sorry , sir . I'll ask the manager to take care of this .
__label__noemo	What's on TV tonight ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I do .
__label__joy	That's a great idea . Let's go ... Oh , the dance hall looks very nice and the music is wonderful .
__label__noemo	150 a month .
__label__joy	I'd like to come back next weekend .
__label__noemo	I want to keep both of them , if that's possible .
__label__noemo	That's what I did .
__label__noemo	Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing.And skipping meals will not help you lose weight.In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals .
__label__noemo	How long have you been learning it ?
__label__noemo	Brilliant idea ! That will make our journey rewarding and much safer .
__label__noemo	Sorry . Was I disturbing you ?
__label__noemo	a dozen .
__label__noemo	Who can't make it in your family ?
__label__noemo	It's idea of my husband . He is always banging the drum for better schools .
__label__noemo	I wish I had a talent like that .
__label__joy	Yeah . I like it . Hey , it looks like the food is ready .
__label__noemo	He isn't a punctual person . We may have to wait for a little while .
__label__noemo	Oh , really ? Nice to meet you . I thought they were going to leave me here on my own ! How long have you been with the company ?
__label__joy	No , not at all . Glad to have you .
__label__noemo	For almost two years .
__label__noemo	The hard drive has 260 G and the RAM is 4 G .
__label__noemo	What's up ?
__label__noemo	We do have a few foggy days in winter.but i would not say we have a lot of fogs.the sky are usually clearly over your city , are they ?
__label__noemo	What are you going to cook ?
__label__noemo	You will .
__label__joy	No problem , sir . But it will cost you extra .
__label__joy	Whose handset sounds so beautiful
__label__noemo	You should just get the basics .
__label__noemo	I partly agree with you . Buying stocks is not difficult , but making money consistently from buying stock is very difficult . Even professionals don ’ t find it easy , so be careful . Anyway , people like us need help with investing . Why not do some online research ? There are data , reports and discussion forums to educate people on how to invest . In addition , you need to visit an established website that offers stock charts .
__label__noemo	Certainly . Who should I say is calling ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much for everything you have done for me during my stay in China .
__label__noemo	Yes , stones .
__label__noemo	Well , how can I put this ? France is a terrible team .
__label__noemo	But your company is huge . Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages .
__label__anger	It's not just for your drinking . But you are lacking sense of responsibility .
__label__sadness	No ... not really . The sad thing is that I wasn't there when she died . I really wanted to be there one last time .
__label__noemo	We have this new ETC smart phone.It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications . It also has a built-in camera , mp3 player and touch screen . It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are .
__label__noemo	Well , if you're not seeing anyone , maybe we could ...
__label__noemo	Why ? It's brand new , and it's perfect on you .
__label__noemo	That is the Ford Focus . A very light but powerful vehicle . It comes with dual side airbags , power steering and power windows , tinted windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission .
__label__joy	my pleasure ! This tea towel ’ s a little ragged . Do you have another one ?
__label__noemo	What kind of soup would you like ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I want to apply for the accountant in your corporation and I think it is not beyond attainment .
__label__joy	In that case , I'm with you . Em.this is good .
__label__noemo	Yes , there is an underground car park near the supermarket .
__label__noemo	You know my bank stuff . My card , my book ...
__label__joy	I'm Mary Smith.Nice to meet you , too .
__label__joy	You're quite welcome .
__label__noemo	Of course ! Everyday , there is a deadline to meet . Bosses watching and testing me all the time , not liking in college , handed in paper months later and tested on schedule . It is so busy . But anyway , I have been trying my best to be a good employee .
__label__joy	No , thanks .
__label__surprise	Did you ? I didn't notice that . But still you should know it , for you have seen it with Laura before .
__label__noemo	Are you kidding me ? Even the girls know Peckham . Whatever , I have a picture of him here .
__label__noemo	I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .
__label__noemo	Well , an important part of the duties of a secretary , I think , is to do well the preparation work for the meeting .
__label__noemo	That would be very kind of you .
__label__sadness	I'm really sorry I let you down . I'll make it up to you somehow .
__label__noemo	Hello . This is the front desk . What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	sorry to hear that . It seems you have sacrificed a lot to work away from home .
__label__noemo	Turn to the next window and they will help you find one .
__label__joy	Do you like western music ?
__label__noemo	Thanks very much . And good-bye .
__label__noemo	Yes , we had a good time . The trip was terrific . We toured the Three Gorges by boat . Its realty exciting !
__label__noemo	not at all . I never really did , to be honest . What about you ? Did your family used to play games together ?
__label__noemo	Sure . You know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone , so I need pay little for receiving calls .
__label__noemo	OK . I will .
__label__joy	Lovely day , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	About 12 o'clock , when I came home from work .
__label__joy	Sure . We ’ ll be looking forward to that day .
__label__sadness	But I still love you .
__label__noemo	Please turn down the TV . And not another shout or I'll have to report you to the school administration .
__label__noemo	I am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . Could you please come for the final round ? It is scheduled on the morning of next Monday 10AM in the HR manager office .
__label__noemo	Does it take a long time to get a visa ?
__label__joy	If I'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me .
__label__noemo	That works for me . Let's see what we can each do about planning our part and meet again on Friday .
__label__noemo	Do you take the original certificate with you ?
__label__joy	Oh . I like this one . I have been looking for this color and design . Please wrap it for me , and I ’ ll take it .
__label__noemo	What ’ s your long term goal ?
__label__noemo	Yes , this is the right desk . Have you any luggage ?
__label__noemo	What do you need today ?
__label__noemo	Yes , we did . But I shall never fly again .
__label__noemo	I ’ m very fond of you .
__label__noemo	no , but my girlfriend has mono .
__label__noemo	Hi , Bill . It's Marsha Black at MPPD Ltd . How are you ?
__label__noemo	I'm not practicing enough .
__label__joy	This book I'm reading about Yoga is really interesting .
__label__noemo	How do you like your overcoat , sir ?
__label__joy	I ’ m so lucky . You only get a chance like this once in a blue moon ! Thanks honey !
__label__noemo	Maybe it is right since everything is possible . You know the market changes quickly these days . But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . For me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns .
__label__noemo	Please fill out this registration card.Here is your key.You can park your car in front of our room.Check - out time is noon .
__label__joy	Thank you , 175 yuan .
__label__noemo	The customer got back to us this morning and they have agreed to pay a Discrepancy Fee of 100 US dollars .
__label__noemo	What are your plans for today ?
__label__noemo	I came here to ask for some information .
__label__noemo	Well , that's not too bad then .
__label__noemo	What's your favorite kind of music ? Do you like pop music ?
__label__noemo	I didn't like her butting in where I didn't want her . She's a chatter box .
__label__noemo	You seem to have filled the form out all right . Are you familiar with our rules and fines ?
__label__noemo	OK , then . I love these unique structured towers with the delicate carvings on them . It's really artistic .
__label__noemo	How do you plan to accomplish this ?
__label__noemo	Taiwan .
__label__noemo	Did you see anyone come into the block flats ?
__label__noemo	Be careful , the cartridge can be very hot .
__label__joy	Great ! Let ’ s do it !
__label__noemo	oh , yes . Our windows let plenty of natural light in . They've also got wonderful views of the park behind our house .
__label__noemo	Yeah . Both Bon and Nordstrom's is having there annual sale . It's a great time to buy some clothes you've been holding out on .
__label__noemo	fine , thanks . How are you ?
__label__joy	Very good , sir . A table for 6 at 8: 00 this evening . May I have your name , please ?
__label__noemo	Oh , do you use your computer often ?
__label__noemo	OK Sir . Could you tell me the account holder's name , the account number , the amount in the account and your PIN number , please ?
__label__noemo	Oh , it's too far to walk there.We can take a bus .
__label__noemo	You know , on weekends when we wanted to have late rise in the morning , our neighbour started to raise Cain .
__label__joy	Ok , I will bring you photos as many as possible .
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . But I think you are making a fuss . They will make it up . Bet it .
__label__noemo	Hmm . You have three cameras . Are you a photographer ?
__label__joy	Is that true ? Shall we invite him to join with us ?
__label__noemo	Do you have concert halls in your city ?
__label__noemo	Did you buy anything in the duty-free stores ?
__label__noemo	What's the problem ?
__label__noemo	Of course . Here you are .
__label__noemo	Carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is up-to-date with their work .
__label__noemo	Have you made a reservation ?
__label__noemo	Maybe they forgot to attach it to the letter . You should give them another call .
__label__joy	Aren ’ t you sweet .
__label__joy	Guess what I've brought for you .
__label__noemo	What's bothering that guy ?
__label__noemo	Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	Of course . You see , almost everyone has some kind of hobby .
__label__noemo	OK , Nick . Here's the question , What movie and its sequel both won an Oscar for Best Picture ?
__label__anger	At least I enjoy my lunch ! What's in your bag ?
__label__anger	Oh , you men ! You're all the same .
__label__noemo	You are fine the way you are . Besides , plastic surgery hurts .
__label__noemo	I'll just get a regular home computer then . I don't think I'll need to lug my computer around with me .
__label__joy	I'd like to meet you again sometime .
__label__surprise	Really ? I will try again .
__label__joy	Have you got any plans ?
__label__noemo	I know one . Let's go .
__label__joy	Tom did me many favors .
__label__noemo	No , I don't like that place . Why don't we try the garage Martin recommended ?
__label__noemo	A post order for four hundred dollars .
__label__noemo	Whenever you have time .
__label__noemo	I think it's highly possible , yes .
__label__joy	So you want to go to Malibu ?
__label__noemo	What about playing go ?
__label__noemo	Oh , it's a pity that you have to leave .
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__joy	Good night .
__label__noemo	Hey , Robert , what are you doing this weekend ?
__label__joy	What's your number ?
__label__noemo	They really started looting ?
__label__noemo	Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes .
__label__noemo	Did your boat float down the river ?
__label__noemo	Can you tell me a little bit about yourself ?
__label__noemo	Oh , it is conveniently located , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	Oh , it's Clive .
__label__noemo	And when we get back from the doctor's , you'll gargle again .
__label__noemo	Could I have your name and room number ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I'm excited to hear about your new product .
__label__joy	How about taking a walk in the park ?
__label__noemo	Ok , it was very nice to talk with you and I look forward to your decision at your earliest convenience . Bye .
__label__noemo	All right . let me check our technician ’ s schedules . I ’ ll call you back and let you know what time we can send a service technician to your house . What is your phone number ?
__label__noemo	With the cost of gasoline these days , that is a big plus . I think this model may be just what I'm looking for .
__label__noemo	That means the apartment has furniture in it .
__label__noemo	What seems to be the problem ?
__label__noemo	Are you able to compose music ?
__label__noemo	Yes , there are 62 in totals , and 2 of them still can't be sure .
__label__joy	I know . It's going to save me a lot of money , I hope .
__label__noemo	No , it isn't strange at all.Many people from Taiwan move to America too , you know.Do you think it is strange for them ?
__label__noemo	Please call if you have any other requests . Your food will be delivered promptly .
__label__joy	Haha , these are very good inventions . All these speak the public's fondness for the sport
__label__noemo	Thank you very much for your dinner .
__label__joy	Thank you . Your cash back is 13 dollars . Pull into a parking states , and we'll bring you your fries in two minutes .
__label__noemo	Could you arrange an appointment with Mr . Smith ?
__label__noemo	Were you able to understand everything that she said ?
__label__noemo	Sorry to bother you sir , but I have some bad news .
__label__noemo	No , I didn't . My brother was very good and I did quite a lot of homework .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	no , but I ’ m planning on visiting Australia and New Zealand soon . I ’ Ve heard that they are beautiful countries . Which is the most beautiful country you ’ Ve been to ?
__label__noemo	I'll say the movie's starting in the minute .
__label__noemo	I'm watching reruns of it .
__label__noemo	really ? What did you think ?
__label__noemo	I have heard its name is connected with someone , is that right ?
__label__noemo	It includes everything except cable TV , and telephone .
__label__noemo	Cycling during weekends ? Do you me riding on the mountainous countryside just the neighboring towns ?
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Actually , I know a great restaurant in Dongcheng .
__label__noemo	What appliances ?
__label__noemo	I ’ ll take it . I also need to improve the lighting in my living room . Do you have any suggestions ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I am . That's why I make plans before I do anything .
__label__noemo	Are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
__label__noemo	A ham salad sandwich .
__label__noemo	So that's where you saw the ghost ? In your house ? What did it look like ? Was it hideous ?
__label__noemo	No , I'll pay for it in cash .
__label__noemo	I should start exercising more .
__label__noemo	Okay . What about the other alternatives ?
__label__anger	I hate doing the damn laundry .
__label__noemo	May I come in ?
__label__noemo	Let's go ask about it .
__label__noemo	That's OK , Ben , just let it go . I thought you were just a little too much into it .
__label__noemo	Ideally , I ’ d like to have a job that will allow me to work from home several days a week . I ’ m the kind of person who can set priorities , work well independently , and set my own pace . I actually successfully worked from home for several months in my current job when a problematic pregnancy forced me to stay in bed . But I realize that many employers do not have experience with employees who work from home , and I have , of course , performed very successfully in a traditional office setting .
__label__joy	OK . Let ’ s go !
__label__noemo	I suppose you ’ re right , Lee . Maybe that ’ s why so many Westerners are overweight .
__label__noemo	Yes , your company is a big one in the field and has great potential .
__label__noemo	This is green tea , you can drink it in summer . It can relieve summer-heat and it is good for maintaining your lungs .
__label__noemo	Can I try it on ?
__label__anger	My amenities bill says that I owe $ 10 for a movie , but I never ordered one .
__label__joy	That ’ s what I was thinking . I ’ ll have them there by Thursday .
__label__noemo	I think it's soon , maybe in a few months . It was renewed in Beijing , so the new expiry date is on the last page .
__label__noemo	It has been 12 years since it was founded in 1998 .
__label__sadness	Have you made the decision yet ?
__label__noemo	Well , he sure likes to run around a lot . Is he well behaved ?
__label__noemo	How are your stocks doing , Jim ?
__label__noemo	Coming . What do you want today ?
__label__surprise	Look ! It looks as if it is going to rain .
__label__noemo	Please have a seat . I know our employment of forcer has already given you the information about your employee contract , but I'd like to go over the main details again before signing . First , you'll be getting a monthly salary , with one month paid vacation after one year of service .
__label__noemo	Here.Near this school .
__label__noemo	Great . What name shall I put the reservation under ?
__label__noemo	Oh , no . You can never tell whether such-and-such is science or sheer fraud.If horoscope is really something deceptive , how come quite a size of proportion of young people think highly of it .
__label__joy	How about taking a walk in the park ?
__label__noemo	What qualifications have you got ?
__label__noemo	I'm not sure of that . Do you know ?
__label__noemo	There is mildew .
__label__noemo	En , would you please give me some bread please ? I am hungry now .
__label__joy	Freshman orientation is the last week of august , but I want to go two weeks before that to get settled in .
__label__noemo	No , I listened to the music , too .
__label__noemo	Next june .
__label__noemo	Oh no ! Mike ’ s birthday is a drinkfest for sure !
__label__noemo	That ’ s what you get for working in a male-dominated field . I think you ’ ll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way . You probably won ’ t be able to change him .
__label__noemo	I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ?
__label__surprise	Not anymore ! Can you believe it ? They've decided that Pluto is not a planet anymore !
__label__joy	What ’ s so great about him ?
__label__joy	That's a good idea.Let ' s go !
__label__joy	Have a great trip .
__label__noemo	That's true . But I just love it . Come here !
__label__noemo	C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .
__label__noemo	I think you should stay in the airport . Even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . Who knows ?
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Where do you think the edge is for black athletes ?
__label__joy	That's great . Thank you very much .
__label__sadness	Definitely . I ’ m really sorry !
__label__surprise	Oh , I can't believe it.He looks very young .
__label__joy	You must have had a great time .
__label__noemo	So I didn't miss by much then .
__label__noemo	He's very nice , actually , but rather eccentric .
__label__joy	I am so glad we met one another .
__label__noemo	Chill out . It's just Kenny from South Park .
__label__noemo	You pay for the taxi and dinner , then to even things up .
__label__noemo	I must be going now .
__label__noemo	OK , I'll give it a go .
__label__noemo	You're right . He is so funny and I think I'm in love with him .
__label__noemo	I've been overseas , So have you been busy lately ?
__label__noemo	So , if all this is agreeable to you , I'll put it all down on paper and fax a contract to you this afternoon . If you can get a signed version of the contract we've agreed upon back to me by tomorrow morning , we can go ahead and make arrangements to ship the product on Tuesday .
__label__joy	You are welcome !
__label__noemo	Not yet . Let me see .
__label__anger	You are always like this . I've told you many times not to tell her .
__label__joy	Good idea . I like hanging out in bars at night .
__label__noemo	I ’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag .
__label__noemo	Have you graduated from college ?
__label__noemo	They are responsibility , skill , patience , quietness , and so on .
__label__noemo	Yes . I want to rent a formal suit for an interview . Can you give me some advice ?
__label__joy	That was a great shot ! A three pointer , yeah !
__label__noemo	Yes . I'd delighted if you did .
__label__noemo	Could you give me an expense report ? I would like to attach the invoices for my phone bill this season .
__label__noemo	What's the purpose for this check ? Would you like to know its repayment capacity ?
__label__joy	I shared a prize with some friends last week . We won a bottle of whisky at a pub quiz .
__label__noemo	Yes , Mr . Mason . I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry . She said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She should be with you shortly . Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ?
__label__noemo	Oh , sorry . Do you know the number for a car store , then ?
__label__joy	You always act like this when you ’ Ve fallen in love . Who is he ? How did you meet ?
__label__noemo	S :: What size prints would you like ?
__label__noemo	It doesn't matter , they are the same thing .
__label__noemo	Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ?
__label__noemo	You , of course , have two ways of responding . You can say yes or come up with another offer .
__label__noemo	taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well .
__label__noemo	Okay , I'll pick it up for you .
__label__noemo	Same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months .
__label__noemo	Yes , sir , it is .
__label__noemo	Could I have one more blanket ?
__label__noemo	John ? It ’ s Susan Miller .
__label__noemo	What's wrong with it ?
__label__joy	Woo cool . Which mountain are you going to conquer ?
__label__noemo	Hold on , please .
__label__noemo	I see why you didn't stop .
__label__noemo	Can you give me a hand ?
__label__noemo	Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ?
__label__joy	Nice to meet you .
__label__noemo	You're going to need to take two buses to get to that Sons .
__label__noemo	How would you like to pay ?
__label__joy	I will .
__label__noemo	Do you mean the contract for equipment rental or the one for training ?
__label__noemo	That's right.But I don't think there are better ways .
__label__noemo	I'd like to hear that .
__label__noemo	I hope you can stay for dinner . I need a guinea pig !
__label__noemo	I am not sure . What's the difference between them ?
__label__noemo	Well , we were contacted by your manager and he said ...
__label__noemo	Right , here you are .
__label__noemo	who wouldn't ! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him .
__label__sadness	Don't laugh at me , please . I'm serious . I've never been required to write this kind of report before , I only do the research reports .
__label__anger	Oh , the food here really is bad . My soup was cold and meat , ur ... it was like leather .
__label__sadness	I have a terrible toothache .
__label__noemo	How long is my paid vacation every year ?
__label__noemo	I could have Suzy stay at my place .
__label__noemo	that's exactly why I decided to quit the job and find a new one .
__label__noemo	Yes , right over here .
__label__joy	I also agree with all his policies .
__label__noemo	Thanks a lot . Give me one ticket , please .
__label__noemo	A few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood .
__label__joy	good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time .
__label__noemo	Very well , ma ’ am . Oh , there seems to be a problem , it says it ’ s rejected .
__label__noemo	What's going on ?
__label__noemo	I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ’ s not still mad at me .
__label__noemo	May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Good . Have you prepared some paper and pencils for the participants ?
__label__noemo	You ’ re right . I ’ ll save the beer for when we land . One orange juice , please .
__label__noemo	Do any of them have dancing figures ?
__label__noemo	You see , if you press this red button , the helmet becomes an umbrella .
__label__noemo	Elegance Hotel , is there anything I can do for you ?
__label__joy	Thank you . Also , we'd like to do some sightseeing while we're in town . Can you recommend some local attractions ?
__label__noemo	Single or return ?
__label__noemo	have you applied to any schools there ?
__label__noemo	I really don ’ t know that much about putting together a resume .
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__joy	Good suggestion . Could you please bring us a chocolate mousse cake and four dessert forks , please ?
__label__noemo	Well , uh , I'll let you decide that for yourself . He'll be here a little later . Here's our room !
__label__surprise	Great ! Will you please tell me how to take it ?
__label__joy	Fantastic ! Please send him my congratulations .
__label__noemo	I suppose I don't want that one then . I don't like auto-reverse . It breaks too easily .
__label__noemo	Didn't you hear about that ? Our meeting was proponed until Friday .
__label__joy	What things make you excited ?
__label__noemo	Just one second , and I'll check .
__label__noemo	Ah , hello . I'm calling to find out how I apply for a car loan .
__label__noemo	Never mind that . Get some dips as well . Get a jar of spinach and blue cheese dip and also some Tzatziki . If they have bean dip get that as well . Last but not least , get some pickles .
__label__noemo	Yes , of course . We have enough productivity . You can rest assured .
__label__noemo	Oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .
__label__noemo	John , it ’ s time to get up .
__label__joy	Yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good .
__label__joy	Yeah , I love red apples .
__label__noemo	I am reading .
__label__sadness	It's almost as if this food has been sitting a little too long . It doesn't seem fresh .
__label__joy	It is kind of strange though , to have snow in April , and so much of it .
__label__noemo	Even if the language is accurate , a misunderstanding can not be avoided due to cultural differences .
__label__noemo	Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know . Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more .
__label__surprise	Don't you have a garage ?
__label__noemo	Oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , I'll always be there .
__label__noemo	What about the price ?
__label__noemo	That's right . Then you will follow the signs to Gate 85 .
__label__noemo	That ’ s what I said when I found out how much the rent was .
__label__joy	That ’ s fine ! Don ’ t worry about it !
__label__noemo	That's exactly what I want . How long does it take ?
__label__noemo	Hello , Miss Wu , This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited . I'd like to check my last order . When exactly was it sent out ?
__label__noemo	OK , sir , I'm sure it's your bag . Thank you for your cooperation . You can have it now .
__label__noemo	yeah , I worked as temporary staff in her concert . Look , her poster , a CD ...
__label__joy	I ’ ll be glad if you would .
__label__noemo	It depends on where you are and what position you are in . For instance , if you are in an elevator and you smile , you will make other takers uncomfortable .
__label__joy	I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ?
__label__noemo	I don ’ t see any problem , only the car is a bit old .
__label__joy	Let's go buy their new album . Want to come with me ?
__label__noemo	Come in , Arnold . Have a seat .
__label__noemo	maybe ... I'll think about it .
__label__noemo	Hi , Shelley . Have you had lunch ?
__label__noemo	I'm calling today about a bill that I never received .
__label__noemo	What happened next ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I ’ d be delighted if you did .
__label__joy	I've come to tell you I'm going to the concert this evening.Will you come with me ? I've two complimentary tickets .
__label__joy	I enjoy chicken salads .
__label__noemo	Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ?
__label__noemo	Okay , but let me know ahead of time .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	The meeting was delayed by thirty minutes and it lasted for two and a half hours .
__label__noemo	I think I may have seen it on the kitchen table .
__label__joy	It's just what I wanted .
__label__noemo	I guess I could take a break.So , how do you like Denver ?
__label__noemo	Sounds good . Thanks a lot .
__label__noemo	Is there anything else I can do for you ?
__label__noemo	I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total .
__label__joy	I believe I will .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	I usually meet some friends and we play sports together or I might spend some time alone on my hobbies . I spend winter evening watching tv , but I spend summer evening at cultural events if I have time .
__label__noemo	Oh , is that so ?
__label__joy	I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .
__label__noemo	Italian , please .
__label__noemo	It doesn't matter to me .
__label__noemo	I ... er ... I just want to know if you could lend me a few bucks .
__label__anger	Ah ! No ! Damn it !
__label__noemo	Oh , I ’ m staving . I ’ d like to try some real Chinese cuisine . What would you recommend waiter ?
__label__noemo	when do the playoffs start ?
__label__noemo	Well it can be but Shanghai is much warmer than London .
__label__noemo	Non-smoking is fine , thank you .
__label__noemo	Don't worry . He'll cross that bridge when he comes to it . My son reads a lot on his computer and uses e-mail to send messages to his friends almost every day . He's really absorbed by the discussions .
__label__noemo	Yes . But I am afraid it is too thick to wear in summer .
__label__noemo	You are really a hen-pecked husband .
__label__noemo	Well , it would be spacious and located next to a park , because a nice view is important to me .
__label__noemo	Pass him .
__label__noemo	Sure , here it is .
__label__noemo	Yes , they're right . In fact , we have either restored or adopted international practices in our foreign trade .
__label__joy	Oh , I see . I believe I can do the job well .
__label__noemo	Now listen , Ben . Look , I think it ’ s a very good thing that a young man — after he ’ s done some very good work — should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself , and lie around , and drink beer and so on . But after a few weeks I believe that person should want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass .
__label__noemo	Oh , there are many Chinese antique stores . They get paintings , too . Do you get interested in them ?
__label__noemo	The Terminal is a movie of this type .
__label__noemo	It wouldn't be full right now , would it ?
__label__noemo	No , we don't , especially the elder people . But more and more young people fall for coffee nowadays .
__label__noemo	I can get that for you .
__label__noemo	Then what should I do ?
__label__noemo	That's going to be $ 4.05 a pound .
__label__noemo	Do you think chinese families have changed much in the last 50 years ?
__label__noemo	But you did a good job . You always perform the best in our company .
__label__noemo	OK . We will increase our order .
__label__noemo	Yes , Madam . The reporting desk for the British Airway's flight to London is over there .
__label__surprise	Good gracious . That ’ s incredible !
__label__noemo	Have I got a high fever ?
__label__noemo	No , I couldn't fall asleep last night .
__label__noemo	I see .
__label__noemo	So , what do you think ? How do you like New York ?
__label__noemo	Shall we have a drink someday ?
__label__joy	I'd love a gin and tonic .
__label__noemo	How do I buy my textbooks ?
__label__joy	Hi , it is a pleasant surprise !
__label__noemo	Hello , Tom !
__label__noemo	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	Yes , sir . I think you'll find our gym quite satisfactory .
__label__noemo	You too .
__label__joy	Until 8 o'clock , ma'am . We are looking forward to seeing you .
__label__noemo	I had no doubt in my mind that he would win .
__label__surprise	Oh , Tom ! I thought you were in Paris .
__label__noemo	Oh , thank you very much .
__label__noemo	Gravy ! Jim is such a jive turkey man . He is always hitting me up for cash . Anyway , you wanna book and go grab some grub ?
__label__noemo	Let's go to queue up . There are so many people in the lines .
__label__joy	We can't complain about the weather recently .
__label__joy	I had a fantastic time .
__label__noemo	Nice to meet you , Lean . My name is Alike . I'm from Japan .
__label__joy	Yes . Nice to meet you , Mrs Smith .
__label__noemo	How about drinks ? Would you like beer or wine ?
__label__noemo	But lifting weights isn't the best thing.You should do some kind of aerobic exercise .
__label__noemo	Let ’ s call it a day .
__label__joy	Nearby , on the banks of the thames , there ’ s the statue of Boadicea . She fought the Romans when they invaded Britain .
__label__noemo	Well , the worst of the winter should be over .
__label__joy	Really ? It took me really a while to find the color . I am happy you like it .
__label__noemo	I have a sweet tooth .
__label__noemo	Sure . I don ’ t mind .
__label__noemo	I see . So , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? That does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free .
__label__noemo	Hey , wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime ?
__label__noemo	Yes , sir . I assure you it would never happen again .
__label__noemo	Oh . It looks like Jack is going to make his annual speech .
__label__noemo	What's your expected salary ?
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__noemo	Fine , just fine.How about you ?
__label__joy	Great !
__label__noemo	Well , I ’ m learning how to use math in the business environment .
__label__noemo	Hi , Don . What a surprise !
__label__noemo	But if we spend all that money we shall be poor again . What will we do then ?
__label__noemo	And how long does the course last ?
__label__noemo	How's business ?
__label__noemo	Is there anything else ?
__label__noemo	I don't think drinking requires any special purposes . For us people in the West , the purpose is generally quite simple-to savor the wine .
__label__noemo	Yes . In fact there are quite a large number of people who have no food to eat and no place to live in .
__label__noemo	Nothing . I am just asking .
__label__noemo	That's not a problem . Have a nap if you can . You don't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
__label__anger	Yeah , you better give me the insurance , because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car .
__label__noemo	No , there are only some vases .
__label__noemo	How do you practice ?
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Yes , everything will be cleared .
__label__noemo	Yes . It's a feast of eyes to walking in the museum .
__label__joy	I liked Aesthetics best . It is very impressive .
__label__noemo	The trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet .
__label__noemo	What time does it leave ?
__label__noemo	No , I ’ d like to know something about contact lenses .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	I think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . If most people have similar amounts of money , they will not think of stealing from others .
__label__noemo	Yup , it ’ s all set .
__label__noemo	No , I haven ’ t .
__label__noemo	I have a small family . They are my parents , my younger brother and me .
__label__noemo	Yes . This is Vanessa .
__label__noemo	to be honest , he has no authority . He's a hard-worker , but no one listens to him .
__label__noemo	Hello , Mr . Smith , Wang Peng speaks .
__label__noemo	I think PCC is a lot better than here .
__label__noemo	It is in the DX community , Room 306 , No . 2 building . It is very easy to find . Just ask the guard at the entrance .
__label__joy	That sounds really nice . What did you do there ?
__label__joy	Thanks a lot . Bye .
__label__joy	Lucky for you , this month we aren ’ t charging our normal installation fee . You are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! And we ’ ll throw in this pen drive !
__label__noemo	Our reservation is under the name of Foster at 7:00 for four people .
__label__anger	I don't buy a story .
__label__noemo	I'm on time today
__label__noemo	I haven't met the Smiths for a long time .
__label__noemo	I ’ d appreciate that , sir . How long do you think you ’ ll need me to stay ?
__label__noemo	We're redecorating our living room .
__label__noemo	Yes . When can I get them back ?
__label__noemo	It certainly is . You can do almost anything with it , anytime , anywhere .
__label__joy	Nice to meet you , Karren . I'm Tim Wang .
__label__noemo	I didn't hear that . But I can deduce the reason .
__label__noemo	Then please cover W . P . A . and TEND for this transaction .
__label__noemo	I have read your resume . I know you have worked for 3 years . Why did you choose to major in mechanical engineering ?
__label__noemo	Yes , that's all right . I want to enroll in the course .
__label__noemo	5 $ . You should change another much clearer photograph for fax .
__label__noemo	Thank you very much , doctor .
__label__noemo	I hope to see you at that time again . Bye .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes , your parents live there , don't they ?
__label__joy	It's a very good game .
__label__noemo	They fit me . Can you make it a little cheaper ?
__label__noemo	Arthur , that ’ s the bathroom .
__label__noemo	It seems that he has gone ape over the girl .
__label__noemo	The girls in this magazine are so slender .
__label__noemo	Why do you think you ’ re the right candidate for this position ?
__label__noemo	How long does it take ?
__label__noemo	I was wondering if you like team projects , or projects that you work on alone .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes . I remember your company .
__label__noemo	Come in please .
__label__noemo	I'm not sure yet .
__label__noemo	That ’ s really interesting . you have to play for me some time .
__label__noemo	I'm just a beginner . Did my poses make me the butt of jokes ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s right . Spraining the ankle and breaking the leg are the common things during the match .
__label__noemo	Fruit juice , milk or mineral water ?
__label__noemo	Let me see . Roll up your sleeve , please . Um ... it's swollen and red here . I'm afraid we'll need to take an X-ray to see if it's broken .
__label__joy	No , thanks . I'm on diet .
__label__noemo	Our seafood is fresh . I recommend shrimp with garlic .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , you look lost.Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	How much is the postage for this postcard to China ?
__label__noemo	Yes.It ' s essential .
__label__noemo	How much is the ticket ?
__label__noemo	For accounting system and things like that , you mean ?
__label__noemo	Why is that ?
__label__noemo	Please I'd like a ticket to New York .
__label__noemo	Can you do me a favor ?
__label__noemo	How does 11
__label__noemo	They said he was an honest and professional businessman . But that's the exciting part . It's kind of like gambling ...
__label__noemo	I don ’ t understand .
__label__noemo	What was the reason ?
__label__noemo	Perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price .
__label__noemo	Is it furnished ?
__label__noemo	What do you want to do to celebrate Christmas ?
__label__noemo	And your name , please ?
__label__noemo	I would like to get a double cheeseburger .
__label__noemo	Don't worry , young man . Lat me give you an examination . First let me take a look at your throat . Open your mouth and say'ah ' .
__label__noemo	Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ?
__label__noemo	I plan on running into her in the cafeteria when she's alone . I think I'll ask her then .
__label__noemo	I see . So this is the bill then and the total is ... ?
__label__noemo	No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband .
__label__noemo	Hi , I have a reservation under the name of Sandals .
__label__noemo	Come on , it's easy , and it'll make you feel good . Why don't you come with me tonight ?
__label__noemo	Is anybody in ?
__label__noemo	Thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side .
__label__joy	Good afternoon !
__label__noemo	Just remember to be professional and polite . Oh , and don ’ t forget to smile .
__label__noemo	Did he telephone again last night ?
__label__noemo	All right . I understand now . Do you think I should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments .
__label__noemo	Yes , I have .
__label__noemo	Yes , right here . So , we can do this today , then ? That will definitely ease my mind .
__label__noemo	it's important to do proper exercises .
__label__noemo	Every class reunion is organized by the president and council and anything our class does for the school in later years is headed by the president .
__label__noemo	It's at the back . I think you are near-sighted . You had better get yourself a pair of nice glasses .
__label__noemo	It ’ s pretty bad .
__label__joy	Okay . I ’ ll take it . Thank you very much for your help .
__label__noemo	I got you . Their competitive edge lies mainly in endurance and stamina . They are creatures from the savannah , and take to running like antelopes .
__label__noemo	Let's just hope the politicians don't figure out a way to spend it .
__label__noemo	Yes , it's straight ahead around the corner .
__label__noemo	I was trying to find the class on preparing for interviews .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , I'd like to ask you a few questions about the city .
__label__noemo	Well , then I'll come again the day after tomorrow .
__label__noemo	yeah .
__label__joy	How do you like this waltz ?
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__joy	Ok , let ’ s start opening some presents !
__label__noemo	What was the date of the reservation ?
__label__noemo	Well , let's try a size ten . ( He gets another pair and the customer tries a shoe on ) Looks like a perfect fit .
__label__sadness	Sorry , sir . That table has been reserved . This way , please . How about this one , sir ?
__label__noemo	I don't know , she didn't say . I'm so sorry about this .
__label__noemo	The working hours are from 9:00 to 11:30 in the morning and from 1:30 to 5:30 in the afternoon . Make sure never to be late or absent . Every time you should use the employee card to show you are present whenever you come into the company .
__label__noemo	What does your car look like ?
__label__noemo	And bring you homework with you , please .
__label__noemo	I haven ’ t got two minutes at the moment . Can ’ t you go over things without me ?
__label__noemo	I'm just not looking forward to cleaning it !
__label__noemo	Don't worry .
__label__noemo	Did they finally fill that post , how come I haven't seen her ? She must have not been inducted yet .
__label__noemo	I ’ m a student from out of state , so I don ’ t have a local driver ’ s license .
__label__joy	Ok , I can see that road .
__label__noemo	I am not good at picking gifts . Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , at least .
__label__noemo	That makes sense . Probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper .
__label__surprise	Doesn ’ t Karen Marsh look old !
__label__noemo	I guess you have a point .
__label__noemo	Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea .
__label__noemo	OK , I will repeat what I said loudly .
__label__noemo	What starting salary would you expect here ?
__label__noemo	Tin or bottle ?
__label__noemo	Well , what about this Thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
__label__noemo	The price on the tag says £ 565 but maybe you can get a discount .
__label__noemo	The best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom .
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry to say no .
__label__noemo	Go right ahead .
__label__noemo	Room service . Can I help you ?
__label__joy	Excellent ! We have the finest cashmeres at affordable prices.How about we get you measured ? Let ’ s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . Now , let ’ s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
__label__joy	Yes , of course , please follow me .
__label__noemo	We require a jacket and tie .
__label__noemo	Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door ?
__label__noemo	He told me that if I showed up late one more time , he'd fire me . He's so mean !
__label__noemo	There are a total of one hundred and sixty parking spaces on the second and third floor , in which twelve are for visitors and the rest are for residents .
__label__noemo	Well , to begin with , we ’ re going to have to get a new desk for you and I ’ d like to replace that old typewriter .
__label__noemo	Perfect ! Do you know the hours and rules for the library ?
__label__joy	Maybe that's what I'll do . Thanks a lot .
__label__surprise	Really ? I love eccentric people .
__label__noemo	It doesn't cost anything .
__label__noemo	I wonder if you can help me . I ’ m looking for a room .
__label__noemo	That sounds good . But what do you want me to do there ?
__label__noemo	So , 1,2 and 3 are prime numbers , but 4 isn ’ t because 2 * 2 = 4 .
__label__noemo	I went there to check for problems with the home , so you aren ’ t surprised when you move in .
__label__noemo	Fantastic ! What do I have to pay per hour ?
__label__noemo	Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me , waiter , would you please bring us a nest ? A friend of mine will join us .
__label__noemo	John , I have been watching you . I've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and I'm impressed . You've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts . I just want to let you to know , after this month's performance reviews , I'm recommending you for promotion .
__label__noemo	Cooking makes me feel relaxed . So , what are we cooking ?
__label__noemo	Do you often surf the Internet ?
__label__noemo	All products have to go through five checks in the whole manufacturing process .
__label__noemo	Yes , please .
__label__noemo	... yes , but this one has an all-new buzz .
__label__noemo	I don't see any mistakes .
__label__noemo	The Grand hotel , is it far from here ?
__label__noemo	You should telephone the garage for help .
__label__noemo	I'd like to send a fax to Shenzhen .
__label__noemo	Well , what kind of dessert do you want ?
__label__noemo	You didn't have an offer ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m doing great , thank you .
__label__noemo	Sorry sir , it is the only flight wa have right now .
__label__noemo	Oh dear . Maybe you ’ Ve caught a cold .
__label__noemo	I bought a new mattress and some fresh bedclothes . I also bought a new dressing table and a new bedside table .
__label__joy	Actually , tears also came to my eyes .
__label__noemo	Is it cold or warm in autumn ?
__label__noemo	What's your number ?
__label__noemo	How do you know there was a break-in ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I have been here for three years .
__label__noemo	We wake up early and go to church.Then we come back home and open our gifts together . How about you ?
__label__noemo	No , but she gave me her friend's telephone number . I can call him and make an appointment .
__label__noemo	I'd like to rent a car for several days .
__label__noemo	Yes . You can take No . 846 from here , but you have to get off at Nanchengmen stop and change to No . 106 .
__label__surprise	There ’ s movie ? My teacher didn ’ t tell me that !
__label__noemo	Thank you so much . You guys are really responsible .
__label__noemo	it's got an above-average battery life . It lasts up tp 12 hours and can be charged in 30 minutes .
__label__noemo	Hi , I want to check out .
__label__noemo	Of course not . We have cooperated for a long time .
__label__anger	Thanks . Sometimes talking with a friend is a great way to get over something . Do you mind if I vent a little bit ?
__label__noemo	Why is that ?
__label__noemo	Great . Thanks .
__label__noemo	Usually about two month .
__label__joy	What a wonderful game !
__label__noemo	you must be joking . You can't fall in love with someone you've never met !

__label__noemo	We go way back.We ' Ve known each other since we were toddlers .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , I ’ m sorry to trouble you . My name is Susan Ransom , and I have placed several orders with you company .
__label__noemo	I know , but that movie was just too good to leave . I guess I'll just have to pay the price and be sleepy .
__label__disgust	Do you think so ? I don't like it very much . I found it rather uncomfortable .
__label__noemo	Mary , how was your date with john ?
__label__noemo	But you must cook that dinner next time .
__label__noemo	I want to take a photograph .
__label__noemo	Is there anything else that doesn't cost as much ?
__label__noemo	Here you are . seventy-five cent , please .
__label__noemo	So Dick , how about getting some coffee for tonight ?
__label__joy	Oh honey , I tell you good news . The apartment I looked at today was pretty decent , around 120 square meters .
__label__noemo	Have you started your report yet ?
__label__joy	It is thoughtful . I will take it .
__label__noemo	You got drunk , and you were hilarious . Lighten up .
__label__noemo	Ha-ha . Last night , I only told him practice makes perfect .
__label__noemo	How would you like it ?
__label__noemo	Do you like to use chopsticks
__label__noemo	Then why isn't there a notice ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s should be fun .
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__joy	Very romantic .
__label__joy	Yes , he described her to me , and she sounded like my type .
__label__noemo	Do we still use the conference room in the same hotel as last time ? You remember ? I like that one .
__label__noemo	True . Keep up the good work . Hello , welcome to the reunion of the Class of ' 93 .
__label__noemo	No , thanks . I'm just looking .
__label__noemo	Yeah , we do . In the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . I heard your city has a lot of fog , is that true ?
__label__noemo	Hi , Bill . I saw you yesterday with a pretty girl .
__label__noemo	Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall .
__label__joy	Yes . He is very understanding and supportive .
__label__noemo	It is RIB 10 yuan initially and 2 yuan for each kilometer .

__label__joy	Oh , I see it . Thank you .
__label__noemo	When will it arrive ?
__label__noemo	It's a very beautiful place in Southwest China .
__label__noemo	Is it out ?
__label__noemo	I'm not really sure . I don't like romance novels , but any other genre is okay , as long as the book's good .
__label__noemo	Sometimes I think Oscars are only awarded to movies that make a lot of money .
__label__noemo	What did she say ?
__label__noemo	Hey honey , how was your day ?
__label__joy	I hope so , too . Thank you , Lily . Thank you for everything .
__label__noemo	Where is she from ?
__label__noemo	What about 15 yuan ?
__label__noemo	Well , maybe not 100 percent . I did hear about some tricks people use .
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__noemo	The popular tour of the season is a 14 - days ' sightseeing to Venice . Are you interested in that city ?
__label__noemo	Single or return ?
__label__disgust	I think you're being a bit optimistic . If you met them , you'd understand .
__label__noemo	Goodbye , Randy . Take care .
__label__noemo	Thanks .

__label__noemo	Alright . Have you been to this hospital before ?
__label__noemo	You need to get on the 261 . It goes all the way to Sons .

__label__noemo	So they met up at the start of the journey and showed each other their equipment .
__label__noemo	Your name and examination number , please .
__label__noemo	yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit .
__label__noemo	That's not bad .
__label__joy	You are welcome , sir . Good-bye .
__label__noemo	Yes . Sometimes the fault is very small ; if you have a needle and thread , you can fix it yourself . So it's a good deal to buy it .
__label__noemo	Yes . It has one bedroom , a large living space and 4 kitchens .
__label__noemo	For accounting system and things like that , you mean ?
__label__noemo	homeless youth can easily become involved with drugs and prostitution . Do you do anything to help them ?
__label__noemo	I will .
__label__noemo	No , but parents control a lot of the environment that kids grow up in , so they certainly influence their kids ' personalities a lot .
__label__joy	Come to my house for Thanksgiving ! We are having turkey , pumpkin pie , mashed potatoes with gravy , and lots of stuffing !
__label__noemo	I didn't minor in any subject when I was in university , but I attended English and computer courses . And I am currently studying finance in a training school .
__label__noemo	How much is it , then ?
__label__noemo	Yeah . You can say that again . It ’ s noisy too .
__label__noemo	After all , she is a five-year-old kid .
__label__noemo	Don't worry . I'll write you a prescription for a new medicine that works wonders .
__label__noemo	My boy . I give you my sympathy to you . However , this meeting is said to be extremely important , so we have to attend it .
__label__noemo	Don't ask such a question . You know it has no certain answer . Everyone knows it is in his heart .
__label__noemo	Hello , welcome to prise star hotel . How may I do for you ?
__label__noemo	but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy .
__label__noemo	Is that right ? Like what kind of changes ?
__label__sadness	No , I don't . I just don't know how to handle this . This is my first time , you know .
__label__noemo	No , Ma'am . Installation isn't included.The price I quoted was just for the units .
__label__noemo	Sure I am . But he responded by saying'what do you mean ? ' .
__label__noemo	It's a quarter to 12 . Could you please drive a little faster ?
__label__noemo	So beat the cat , but don't kill it .
__label__noemo	What's up ?
__label__noemo	Well , can you be more specific ? There are a lot of websites about that .
__label__noemo	Yeah , well , I fill you in one the details later .
__label__disgust	Gross . Diarrhea ?
__label__noemo	How do you feel what you have done ? Did you meet our goals ?

__label__noemo	What'd you like , madam ?
__label__joy	Thank you so much .
__label__noemo	My hard drive crashed .
__label__noemo	Hi , I am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow . A technician has just come and checked it . He will bring me a new one tomorrow . It seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing . Can I use the one in your office ?
__label__noemo	Cash or credit card ?
__label__joy	Oh , you have a crush on someone , don't you ? Maybe those are wedding bells in your eyes !
__label__noemo	Not at all , but you get what you pay for .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'll see that she get the message when she checks in .
__label__joy	Oh , thanks . I wanna see the real you .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__surprise	Really ? What ’ s the catch ?
__label__noemo	Yes . But only if you ask me nicely .
__label__noemo	I think that you are right . Maybe they can give us a free dessert or something .
__label__noemo	That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself !
__label__noemo	Yes , I ’ m enquiring about your advertisement for a sales manager in today ’ s newspaper . Is this position still open ?

__label__surprise	Oh , there is something wrong with my car .
__label__noemo	What ’ s the difference ?
__label__noemo	You can also ask the interviewer about your performance today .
__label__surprise	He did ? That's too bad !
__label__noemo	I have worked here long time .
__label__joy	So , I can talk to my Personal Banker 24/7 . That's really thoughtful of you . And I have to say , I love the new look of the bank .
__label__noemo	Really ? That's unbelievable .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll also set some cups and saucers for some coffee after dinner .
__label__noemo	The doctor told me to stay about one month .
__label__noemo	Yes , let me see some of your hats , please .
__label__noemo	I would also like a bag of chips .
__label__sadness	How am I going to face the fellows in our office ? They thought I would be promoted . They must be waiting for my good news .
__label__joy	Thank you . I think today we will go there .
__label__noemo	Yes , that's why I'm here . I'm thinking about buying a second-hand apartment .
__label__noemo	You want to take pictures of the inside of your pocket ?

__label__joy	Thank you , sir . Have a nice day .
__label__noemo	I guess so . Going to watch a movie and having dinner at a restaurant are usual .
__label__noemo	You got what I meant . Perhaps , what I steal are not vegetables , but loneliness .
__label__noemo	I'll get our Mortgage Adviser for you . Please take a seat , I won't be a minute .
__label__noemo	Forest Restaurant . What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Have you eve worked with tape recorders before ?
__label__noemo	Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer .
__label__noemo	Can I give her a message for you ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I am ready . Thank you .
__label__noemo	Eh , so so .
__label__noemo	Do you have any skirt that will go with this sweater ?
__label__noemo	Hey , what's the matter ?
__label__noemo	Maybe three times . As I said , I always forget it .
__label__noemo	I see .
__label__noemo	It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case .
__label__noemo	That won ’ t be a problem .
__label__noemo	Just some fried rice please .
__label__noemo	At Huangshan .
__label__noemo	You will be going northwards . You are now in the the Western part of the city and the Allied Irish Bank is situated in the North East . Here's a rough sketch of the area .
__label__noemo	maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse .
__label__noemo	Other competitors have almost caught up with him . They are neck and neck .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll take a little milk , but no sugar , please . Make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
__label__joy	Oh , I know what you mean . I'm addicted to that game .
__label__noemo	I'd like to buy a keepsake for my girlfriend . Could you make a recommendation for me ?
__label__noemo	OK !
__label__noemo	How about Daniel ?

__label__noemo	movie salon ? where is that ?
__label__noemo	I don't know . I called the police as soon as I found the lock broken .
__label__noemo	It ’ s because of good quality and the fine design .
__label__noemo	( She probed my teeth and checked my gums . ) Well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . We need to fill that cavity before it gets any worse and the crown needs to be refitted . Make an appointment for next week and I'll take care of them .
__label__noemo	Well , we've got some great mangoes on sale .
__label__noemo	Uh , no . Analog watches don't come with stopwatches . You'll have to get a digital if you want a stopwatch .
__label__noemo	Well , give me the Walkman . I'll listen to the music then .
__label__noemo	Good . Do you know anything about this company ?
__label__noemo	What should I do about it ?
__label__noemo	Oh , hey , did you look in the classified ads ?
__label__noemo	Yes , that's quite all right for me .
__label__noemo	Well , can you help me look for it ? That's my first time here .
__label__noemo	About 100 words a minute .
__label__noemo	You can super-size your meals for only three dollars extra .

__label__noemo	No , he's living in an old house in Warton .
__label__noemo	OK , I will take it . By the way , does the price include breakfast ?
__label__joy	You're welcome . We wish you a speedy recovery . Goodbye .
__label__noemo	can I see these silk ties ?
__label__noemo	Study , study , study . I want to learn a lot .
__label__noemo	Davids who , we have 5 Davids in the office .
__label__noemo	I like No . 4 .
__label__noemo	That's because you cheated .
__label__noemo	Right . Just take off your jacket and shirt . And lie down on that bed over there ... That's right ... Now , just hold up your right arm , will you ? ... Does this hurt ?
__label__noemo	Your major must be computer .
__label__noemo	Of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . But all in all , it is more serious and professional . The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher .
__label__noemo	Let me take your blood pressure . You look anilic . Well , Mr.Brown . I ’ m happy to say it ’ s nothing serious . You just a little run down from overwork .
__label__noemo	How long have you waited ?
__label__noemo	Managerial staff is anyone who is in a position of authority or responsibility , or who has anyone working under them . It includes all supervisors and department heads .
__label__noemo	Is that right ?
__label__noemo	Got it . Can we see any things left by them ?
__label__noemo	There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
__label__noemo	He ’ s not in at the moment . Can I take a message ?
__label__noemo	Can I make it for tomorrow at 9

__label__noemo	Yes , this is very light . But the handle is also aluminum .
__label__noemo	Well , if you think you are ready , I'll let you enroll .
__label__joy	Wait and see . I want to try horseback riding after fishing . It looks very exciting and fun .
__label__noemo	I have no idea . Measure me , please .
__label__noemo	It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .
__label__noemo	Yes , I believe so . How should I compensate for this ?
__label__noemo	I have had enough gin fizz and bloody mary . But I have no idea about Chinese cocktails .
__label__noemo	Thanks .
__label__joy	You are welcome .
__label__sadness	Sorry , sir , my mistake . This is your parking space .
__label__noemo	How much is your profit margin then ?
__label__noemo	I thought the overall plot of the movie was very interesting , but I don't think the character development was that strong .
__label__noemo	Mr . Jones , shall we now discuss the packaging ?
__label__noemo	Cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine .
__label__noemo	Anything wrong with it ?
__label__noemo	This will fix all of that for you . If you use our online payment service , the money will come straight out of your account and go directly into the seller's account , in a secure way .
__label__noemo	Yes and maybe a jacket in case it gets cool .

__label__surprise	Taylor ? Taylor ! Is this a joke ? Is it really you ? But ... but ... everyone said you were dead !
__label__noemo	Are you taking anything ?
__label__noemo	I'll have a double whiskey on the rocks .
__label__noemo	You're too humble .
__label__noemo	Round trip or one way trip ?
__label__noemo	Do you know when it is going to start working again ?
__label__noemo	Zina , why are you whispering ?
__label__joy	Mike's going to have a self-driving traveling across the country .
__label__noemo	No problem . How many are you thinking about ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I do . I have worked as a salesman for P & G Company Ltd .

__label__noemo	Watsup , ladies ! Y'll looking ’ fine tonight . May I have this dance ?
__label__noemo	how does that compare with other models ?
__label__surprise	That ’ s impossible .
__label__noemo	Excellent . So you'll have a good chance of getting it .
__label__noemo	In that case , you are not allowed to work in China , until you get the employment petition .
__label__noemo	Here's a pen for you .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot !
__label__noemo	Have you made a reservation , sir ?
__label__noemo	Hi , Francis .
__label__noemo	I think it ’ s my ankle .
__label__noemo	Are you a wrestler or a boxer ?
__label__noemo	It's almost ready . Can you set the table ?
__label__noemo	Well , that's fine .
__label__noemo	Love is blind , you know .
__label__noemo	Is this Mr David Richton ?
__label__noemo	Yes , all of us have naps .
__label__noemo	I know where to get them from .
__label__noemo	No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
__label__joy	Thank you . That's a good idea.she likes exciting books . Can you suggest another one ?
__label__noemo	It lies in perseverance .
__label__noemo	That's too bad . We could really use someone who is bilingual .
__label__noemo	It means there must be no naked flames or sparks anywhere near flammable materials . If the materials ignite , it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them .
__label__joy	Brad Bush ? Good for you !
__label__noemo	Looking at the spice rack , I ’ d say you ’ Ve been learning how to make asian food .
__label__noemo	Fill out this form and we will send you a note when we get the book .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t worry , Shan always screws up free throws .
__label__noemo	Do you have much experience with kids ?
__label__noemo	Why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? You ’ ll have the same time for work .
__label__noemo	The best opportunity is called callous , which is an Internet-based job placement service that you can make use of .
__label__noemo	Nothing important . I've been working overtime lately .
__label__joy	Oh , speaking of the conductor , he is indeed a genius.He did a perfect job.His name is Menuhin , a descendent of Russian American immigrants .
__label__joy	Check out what happens when I put on the brakes suddenly . It can stop quickly .
__label__noemo	I'm wondering whether you could come over for a pizza sometime next week ?
__label__noemo	She worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well , they asked her if she wanted to work full time .
__label__noemo	There is a tornado warning on . My mother just told me she heard it on the radio .
__label__noemo	Catch it on Altadena Drive .
__label__noemo	I had some good financial news yesterday too .
__label__noemo	Could you adopt D / A or D / P ? You see I have to pay a deposit when I open a letter of credit . That will tie up my funds and add to the cost of my imports , especially for such a huge order .
__label__noemo	Maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present .
__label__noemo	With the job ?
__label__noemo	Hello , Mr.Green . This is Lin Tong . How are you ?
__label__noemo	That can be discussed .
__label__noemo	Is there any flexibility on that ?
__label__noemo	I can't seem to find my class .
__label__noemo	Oh no , we just make an impression of your card using our credit card machine . It ’ s in lieu of a deposit . If everything is OK when you check out , we give it back to you then . It ’ s pretty sta
__label__noemo	Well , what do you want to eat ?
__label__noemo	I will try my best .
__label__anger	Why not ?
__label__surprise	Oh , I thought I could make a right turn on red here .
__label__noemo	Do you mind helping me ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I am afraid there are not enough outlets .
__label__noemo	Not good for business ? I don't see eye to eye with you.The new policy offers new opportunities .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t understand .
__label__noemo	What if we miss something ?
__label__joy	Well , now you know . Let's go to the lake over there . Some people are fishing over there . I haven't had a chance to fish in a lake , I really want to try .
__label__noemo	I think Andy's party will be fun .
__label__noemo	Why don ’ t you apply for one right now ?
__label__joy	A highchair and car seat ! Wow Betty , thank you so much ! I really appreciate it !
__label__noemo	Haven't you ever seen him working late ?
__label__noemo	You're the first guest to arrive . I'll just put your coat away and then I'll get you something to drink .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . Is anyone sitting here ?
__label__noemo	About a mile and a half .
__label__joy	I honestly want my hair that short .
__label__noemo	I guess I've done the same thing last time I was here with her , too . I mean falling asleep . For me , this one is not that attractive .
__label__noemo	That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying !
__label__noemo	David , Chou .
__label__noemo	Certainly . Here you are . Our health authorities said they were no longer suitable for human consumption . I have to remind you that our terms are CIF Hamburg . I hope you would indemnify us for the loss , so it wouldn't be so heavy on us .
__label__noemo	Hello . I have left my key in my room . But I can't get in now .
__label__noemo	Hello , IMPF Bank , how can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Can you turn the lazy Susan for me ? I want some more chicken .
__label__noemo	I wish he could too .
__label__noemo	The machine gives you an edge over your competitors , I guess .
__label__joy	Yes , I will . Take care , then .
__label__noemo	Soft-boiled , please .
__label__surprise	I have to go to court over a brake light ?
__label__noemo	We still have more to go , I think .
__label__noemo	Me , too . What would you like to do ?
__label__noemo	20kg.Yours is not overweight . Here is your boarding pass and baggage tag.Please go to the satellite hall to wait for boarding .
__label__noemo	That's wonderful , sir . Now , here's your key . Should you need anything , just dial 0 .
__label__noemo	Thank you for your help . I think I'll open a current account .
__label__noemo	I'm not comfortable about this , Sandy . I don't understand most of these games .
__label__noemo	Well , speak of the devil .
__label__noemo	That sounds boring to me .
__label__noemo	A deposit ? Isn't my luggage a deposit ?
__label__noemo	I have got a run . Can you tell me where is the restroom ?
__label__noemo	Oh , believe it or not , I came across an article the other day , saying that pizza is a healthy food .
__label__noemo	Good morning !
__label__noemo	Tell me if you need help .
__label__noemo	I have a little experience . I guided a few foreign tourists around Beijing last year as a part-time job . I showed them to the Great Wall , the Imperial Palace , and the Summer Palace .
__label__noemo	I told you the truth . According to the contract , if you fail to honor the contract , we are entitled to cancel it .
__label__noemo	Sure , why not ? I think I want a chocolate chip cookie , too .
__label__joy	I'll give you a call later . We should hang out . It's good to be around people .
__label__noemo	No problem . Could I have the cash and your Bank Book , please ? Oh dear ... there seems to be some problems here ...
__label__surprise	Really ? I'm not much of an outdoor person . What do you like about it ?
__label__joy	Interesting ! I am amazed how big and delicious thanksgiving dinners are !
__label__noemo	I have no idea yet . Do you have any suggestions ?
__label__noemo	Well , you are right . But sometimes she is too caring . Well , no ... she ’ s just possessive and I kind of want a break ... you know ... for some room for myself .
__label__noemo	maybe it is for the best . They are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
__label__noemo	Maybe it ’ s just a rash or an allergy ! We can ’ t be sure until I see a doctor .
__label__noemo	Sure . This library is too quiet though .
__label__noemo	Well . I ’ ll see , sometimes the store don't have some one of new kinds of cereal .
__label__noemo	It must have been fun seeing those unusual animals and birds .
__label__noemo	Yep . Every country in the world has a different system , but here we buy insurance from a private provider .
__label__noemo	Are you sure ?
__label__noemo	I'm going to dinner with my family .
__label__noemo	Our cousin Pete ! My turn ! She has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin !
__label__noemo	Shall I see you on Friday morning ?
__label__noemo	Twice a year ? How long has your sister lived in Boston ?
__label__noemo	Do you mean there is no way to get any foreign money ?
__label__noemo	Could I first ask about the remuneration package ?
