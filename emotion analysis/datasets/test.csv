__label__noemo	Nice to meet you , sir . I come from New Times Clothes Company . We learnt that your exhibits on the Trade Fair in Shanghai this month were marvelous . Would you please quote the price ?
__label__noemo	Table-tennis is our national game .
__label__noemo	Is this the one you want ?
__label__noemo	I spend all my time looking after my baby . I'm so tired .
__label__noemo	What problem is that ?
__label__sadness	You know how hard I try to quit , I've lost without you . I am mot let you go .
__label__noemo	Yes , a buffet breakfast is served every morning . I will need your name and your credit card details in order to complete the reservation .
__label__noemo	Single , please . How much in total ?
__label__noemo	I also feel that work efficiency here is very high . and you have strong working ability and professional skill , it seems that you know all , that's really wonderful !
__label__noemo	It sounds like a good plan to me . I'm still ... I mean ...
__label__noemo	We are busy in preparing for the train.Would you please buy us some fruit ?
__label__noemo	My fax machine ’ s on the blink . Would you take a look at it ?
__label__noemo	Don't you have the exams coming up soon ? I'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those .
__label__noemo	Good afternoon . May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Black ?
__label__noemo	Don't you like to know anything about stocks ?
__label__noemo	Yes . The air-conditioner in this room doesn't work .
__label__noemo	Yes . My eyes are small so I want to buy false eyelashes .
__label__noemo	Well , come and talk to me then .
__label__noemo	unfortunately , it ’ s inevitable that some people are going to work hard yet not succeed .
__label__noemo	I think I prefer face-to-face instruction better .
__label__noemo	Good evening , ma'am . May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Yes , Friday I have a class right after work .
__label__sadness	Hi . I just lost my purse when I was shopping on the street . I guess somebody stole it from me .
__label__noemo	White pantyhose ?
__label__noemo	Yes , Sir , go ahead , here you are .
__label__noemo	Hi , why do you look so depressed today , Mike ?
__label__noemo	What should I do with my legs then ?
__label__noemo	Do you mind if I ask you a question ?
__label__noemo	OK , here it is .
__label__noemo	Sorry , my English isn ’ t so good . Could you speak a little slower ?
__label__noemo	I'll see . I will if I can but I won't promise .
__label__noemo	Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I worked as temporary staff in her concert . Look , her poster , a CD ...
__label__noemo	I promise I will .
__label__noemo	I couldn't find the files you request , even though I checked all the cross-references . I don't think it's there .
__label__noemo	Good morning , sir !
__label__noemo	Here it is . Well , remember to have our cards on to tell every visitor where we come from .
__label__noemo	Yes , I will .
__label__noemo	Humph ! Right , so what did you get ?
__label__noemo	I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . But why not take it easy ?
__label__noemo	Um ... no .
__label__noemo	Yeah . And a semi jack-knifed trying to miss a stalled car in the fast lane . You can imagine what happened after that .
__label__noemo	Definitely . I need to have enough time to have a rest on this weekend . We worked like bees in the whole working days .
__label__noemo	You mean the room thirteen-thirteen ?
__label__noemo	Should we have gotten off the bus already ?
__label__noemo	I have a class around there right now .
__label__sadness	That ’ s weird .
__label__noemo	Yes , they are .
__label__noemo	Yes , it does .
__label__noemo	I wonder Why .
__label__noemo	Hello , Bill.May I borrow your pen ?
__label__noemo	They were all sitting in the living room watching TV.They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house.If it had hit them , they could have all been killed .
__label__noemo	I've been working hard for a whole year . I really need a break .
__label__joy	My pleasure .
__label__noemo	Okay , I'll do it next time .
__label__noemo	Wow ! This sounds like something my wife would really enjoy ! Are there any outdoor activities we can take part in ?
__label__joy	Oh , Joanne , are we making a big mistake ? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ’ t reconcile and try again ? I still love you .
__label__noemo	I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works .
__label__noemo	It's the Powell orchestra .
__label__noemo	you have to be very careful with seafood . It tastes lovely , but it often causes upset stomachs . Have you heard anything from tom ?
__label__noemo	Is she just working temporarily ? What are they going to do when Maggie comes back from leave .
__label__noemo	Yes , May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Then I have to call another taxi , or I'll be late .
__label__noemo	It ’ s none of my business .
__label__noemo	Please take a seat .
__label__noemo	I like PCC better .
__label__noemo	Thank you !
__label__noemo	That ’ s everything .
__label__noemo	Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that .
__label__noemo	Hello , Anna . Come in and sit down .
__label__noemo	Yes.Do you know where it is ?
__label__noemo	Hold on , please . Let me check it for you . Yes , you're right . You will keep it for 3 days .
__label__noemo	How would you describe your ideal job ?
__label__noemo	You said it . Many parents just don ’ t know how to educate their children .
__label__noemo	It is unnecessary . I'll see you off at the airport .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , I want to know the price of your CPU .
__label__noemo	Hold on , let me pull up your version 7 requirements ... Oh yes , no wonder our estimate is a little different from what you had in mind . I see the version 7 also includes 6 additional hostesses and a cocktail self-serve bar that wasn't in the version 12 . That will definitely add to your cost on this project ...
__label__noemo	Well , wish him a happy birthday for me .
__label__noemo	Will you be here long ?
__label__noemo	I usually calm down first and think about the reason that caused my anger .
__label__noemo	We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us .
__label__anger	Yes , and please be more careful in the future !
__label__noemo	May , I really regret watching it with you last night .
__label__noemo	How long have you been lifting weights ?
__label__noemo	Are you interested in mountaineering ?
__label__noemo	Why don't we just make it a friendly game ?
__label__noemo	Of course I know it , but you know it's hard to quit smoking ...
__label__noemo	Before the New Year , we always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year . On the street and in stores people usually greet others with a ' Happy New Year ' . It's also common for people to make a New Year's resolution .
__label__noemo	How do you ensure quality ?
__label__noemo	Hello . My name is Jessica Smith . I ’ d like to cancel the newspaper .
__label__joy	Hello , Mary . How are you ?
__label__noemo	I like blue . You see , that's the color of the sky . I wanna be a superman .
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	And here's your change . Please check if it is correct .
__label__noemo	Her name is Fluffy . She is a sweet dog .
__label__noemo	I am free on Tuesday afternoon from 2 PM to 4 PM , is it convenient for you ?
__label__noemo	I ’ ll put it on my Visa card , then .
__label__noemo	Can you direct me to Holiday inn ?
__label__noemo	We're sure we will . And welcome to our corporation next year . We're expecting you .
__label__noemo	Evening .
__label__surprise	Let ’ s see ... These numbers are off the charts ! What's going on here !
__label__noemo	Can you tell me what time we're arriving ?
__label__noemo	Not bad . But there is more room for improvement .
__label__noemo	They'd say I was a handworker and a real team player .
__label__noemo	This afternoon ?
__label__noemo	What sort of shift-system do you operate ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Hello . Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	I'll give you some medicine , and you will be better in a couple of days .
__label__noemo	I ’ m so sorry I ’ m late . But Henry ’ s car broke down .
__label__joy	Great .
__label__noemo	Have you had any experience as a guide ?
__label__sadness	Yes , but I'm not feeling very better now . Actually I'm feeling even worse .
__label__noemo	Hi , I'm calling about the ad in the paper .
__label__noemo	How is he ?
__label__noemo	It's very thoughtful of you . Wow , it is so beautiful . Could you tell me how American people celebrate Christmas ?
__label__noemo	I'm sick of it , too .
__label__noemo	It is quite important for all of us . Without clear goals , one may lose direction and cannot pave the way for their future .
__label__noemo	Well , why not dine out together and go to the moves .
__label__noemo	I have to see the dentist . We have an appointment for this morning from 9 to 11 o ’ clock . So if there is any phone call , please pick up for me . If there is something urgent , tell them I will be back in two hours .
__label__noemo	It's Sunday today .
__label__noemo	Not bad . It seems you are super yogurt lover . You have so many in your cart .
__label__noemo	It ’ s a lot harder than I imagined . There are many things that you have to to arrange . I booked a time and date with the funeral home , but I still have a lot of things to do .
__label__noemo	What are your rates ?
__label__noemo	What's up ?
__label__noemo	Yes , we are visiting the exhibition this afternoon , and look around Beijing city , wouldn't we ?
__label__noemo	Certainly , madam . The deepest place is two meters but you can swim in the shallow area , which is only l . 4 meter in depth . We have separate locker rooms over there and they are free of charge .
__label__noemo	Sorry , I really can't do that . There's little time left for us .
__label__noemo	Yes . The lights were out all night .
__label__noemo	By doing whatever is necessary .
__label__noemo	Fine ! Will you need part-time or full-time work ?
__label__noemo	I hear that John's leading a double wife .
__label__noemo	Do you feel like dancing ?
__label__noemo	I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa .
__label__noemo	Ms . : If a teacher stops you in the hallway , just show him or her the pass .
__label__noemo	Sure , what's up ?
__label__joy	OK .
__label__noemo	Hey , Mary , can you cut that out ?
__label__noemo	What are you talking about ? We'll split the bill .
__label__joy	Come have a look , I received many beautiful e-cards . They are from my friends , all over the world . Christmas wishes for all my friends .
__label__noemo	Great . What floor is the pharmacy on ?
__label__noemo	I wish I could tell you yes , but no , there isn't .
__label__noemo	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	I know it does , and that's because it is .
__label__noemo	Which one will you be going to ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry to hear that . Have you been looking for another job ?
__label__noemo	It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
__label__noemo	I need to stay in the area because of my family .
__label__noemo	I was wondering if you have any vegetarian choices .
__label__noemo	I read that someone called him a cheat and a liar ! And I noticed that he won't ship abroad .
__label__noemo	This is for internal use . Two tablets , four times a day .
__label__noemo	Basically , I've been working too .
__label__noemo	It was nice to see you , too.And please give my regards to Mrs.Robbins .
__label__noemo	Is this the right counter for gloves ?
__label__noemo	well , I can ’ t just image it .
__label__noemo	There ’ s nobody here by that name .
__label__noemo	I am afraid there is none .
__label__noemo	Do you feel like having anything to eat ?
__label__joy	Oh , yes ! This is much better . But it has an aluminum handle .
__label__noemo	Really ? I'll also try to speak slowly . How would you arrange the guests ' seats , Jane ?
__label__joy	Same here .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes . He's brilliant . Did you like the title song ?
__label__noemo	Don ’ t worry . There ’ s plenty of time yet .
__label__noemo	Well , honey , wake up , or you'll be late for school .
__label__noemo	If I have time , I will come again .
__label__noemo	Hey ! How was your first day of class ? I ’ m in level two and I ’ m loving my class this semester ! It ’ s great being in a class of international students !
__label__noemo	Because in this duty-free shop , your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife .
__label__joy	how do you like working in sales ?
__label__noemo	I wish it was a nicer day today .
__label__noemo	When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? Next Saturday ?
__label__noemo	Under which category do you intend to apply ?
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	I think he'll be back in about an hour at least .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Just look at the screen here . It'll give you prompts , you see ? Now you need to enter your PIN number , then press ' enter ' to confirm it .
__label__noemo	I guess so .
__label__noemo	I can't wash at home because my machine is broken .
__label__noemo	Hello ?
__label__noemo	What are these red things sir ?
__label__joy	Congratulations ! I had no idea .
__label__noemo	Cash , please .
__label__noemo	He borrowed it from Nick .
__label__noemo	How about this wallet ? It's made of fine leather .
__label__anger	Never mind being sorry , what are you going to do about it ?
__label__noemo	Did you get your grades yet ?
__label__noemo	It's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
__label__joy	I also enjoyed it and was wondering if you would like to go for a hike in the mountains with me on Saturday .
__label__noemo	That's expensive .
__label__noemo	How good are you at sports , Bill ?
__label__noemo	Well , how about the 4th ?
__label__joy	You're welcome . Bye .
__label__noemo	Totally cool colors !
__label__noemo	No , thanks .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , sir . What can I do for you ?
__label__surprise	You must be joking !
__label__noemo	Just because you work for a week doesn ’ t mean that you will be losing your benefits .
__label__noemo	Actually , two of them have dancing figures .
__label__noemo	Well , let me check for you . Yes , you are booked already . It's a single room with a bath , facing the south .
__label__joy	Getting cheaper is not the only reason for their popularity.They come with a lot of inviting functions .
__label__noemo	May I have your room number , please ?
__label__joy	Yes , certainly . I'll be back in a minute.Here you are .
__label__surprise	Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market .
__label__noemo	Hello , nice to meet you . I ’ m Mr . Gotcha . Have any trouble finding the place ?
__label__noemo	Another flight attendant is coming down the aisle with coffee and tea .
__label__noemo	No thanks . Western women usually try to make their skin darker , not lighter .
__label__joy	Happy Independence Day !
__label__noemo	And anything to drink ?
__label__noemo	Don't you see I'm trying my best ?
__label__noemo	Yes . What about you ?
__label__noemo	Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer , and you'll be off and running .
__label__joy	I really appreciate all your help .
__label__noemo	What about birth control pills ? Don't they work on Italians ?
__label__noemo	I don't think we are boring . It's just that we don't have any hobbies .
__label__noemo	That'll be most helpful .
__label__noemo	I need it delivered at 12 o'clock .
__label__joy	We can discuss them detailedly over the meeting and choose the best way to promote our key products .
__label__noemo	My parents live by themselves now . when they get older , they ’ ll probably go to a retirement home . Do you just have one brother ?
__label__noemo	Hold on . Just 5 minutes .
__label__noemo	Can I reserve a hotel room ?
__label__noemo	Wow , a story about the clever Monkey King . It's a classic and children's favorite .
__label__noemo	The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 .
__label__noemo	I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities .
__label__joy	What part of the film do you like best ?
__label__noemo	$ 200 altogether .
__label__sadness	Oh , I'm sorry .
__label__joy	That would be great .
__label__noemo	How is that the only thing that you'll eat ?
__label__noemo	Yes , we'd have your regular dinner . What courses are there , please ?
__label__noemo	Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things .
__label__noemo	yes , I'm going to take a holiday tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Yeah , it's very funny . Have you ever watched it before ?
__label__noemo	How much are the roses ?
__label__noemo	Where's my book ?
__label__noemo	But the problem is she and her ex-boyfriend are working in the same department . It is somehow embarrassing for them to see each other everyday .
__label__noemo	I'll be there in April Friday through Monday , the 14th through the 17th .
__label__noemo	Well , we could probably get started with a preparatory meeting this afternoon at 2:00 .
__label__noemo	Let's see . Yes . You ' Ve got quite a high temperature .
__label__joy	All right , ma'am , they'll be ready for you in an hour .
__label__noemo	Oh , I guess I'm a little confused .
__label__noemo	Yes , you can have it delivered or filled at any location in our HMO .
__label__noemo	Of course . I'm currently the subscriber of 10 different fashion magazines .
__label__noemo	When are they going to have the party ?
__label__noemo	Psychology .
__label__joy	The operation was very successful .
__label__joy	I ’ m sure I will .
__label__noemo	If you could guarantee compensation in case the insurance com - any refuses to honor a claim for faulty packing , we would be quite willing to accept cartons .
__label__noemo	When did the trouble start ?
__label__fear	No way . I will be scared out of my wits .
__label__noemo	Did you eat something strange ?
__label__noemo	Not bad . You really know your booze ... So I guess you know what's in the salsa , too ?
__label__noemo	How would you like it ?
__label__noemo	You are right . Let's buy the cheaper one .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t boast and don ’ t be modest .
__label__joy	Good . Let's call it a deal . We will do our best to advance the shipment , but your L / C should be opened early Sep .
__label__noemo	What's your hobby ?
__label__noemo	It isn't a good time because there must be many tourists in the scenic spots . What about your plans ?
__label__joy	Bye-bye !
__label__noemo	I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-depth research before I send my application letters out .
__label__noemo	They don ’ t now , but most of them did originally . There ’ s picture of the pentagon in the United States . It ’ s very distinctive with its five sides .
__label__joy	Yes , there aren't any clouds in the sky and we've got such a beautiful view here . Look ! This is St James Park . And there's Buckingham Palace
__label__sadness	Terrible .
__label__sadness	Yeah but , he is always in a really foul mood . I try to find out what ’ s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but , he always shuts down and brushes me off .
__label__noemo	What are you doing here today ?
__label__noemo	Any rain ?
__label__noemo	Yes , the Sunset Hotel is three blocks away . Maybe you can ask them .
__label__noemo	On Trans Pacific international flights , each ticketed passenger is permitted a maximum of two checked bags with a maximum weight per checked bag of 70 pounds .
__label__noemo	I liked sales strategies most .
__label__noemo	All right . We have a single room available right now .
__label__noemo	We usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
__label__noemo	Oh , for Pete's sake . This is cosmetic . My brows are falling out . I did this for convenience .
__label__noemo	Too risky anyway.It ' s necessary to look before you leap .
__label__joy	Okay . Thanks for your help .
__label__noemo	Do you find it hard to get ingredients for Chinese food ?
__label__joy	Good ! I just thought I'd let you know .
__label__noemo	Well , you know how important a clean house is to your grandma .
__label__joy	Yes , I did . Did you ?
__label__noemo	We can get started as soon as you fill out this form .
__label__joy	You do ? I just bought this outfit a couple days ago .
__label__noemo	No , not much . I got it on sale at the mall - 60 % off .
__label__noemo	I usually have cereal , but sometimes I cook a traditional English breakfast .
__label__noemo	No , the test skips a lot of things in the book .
__label__noemo	I couldn't come .
__label__anger	Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?
__label__noemo	Then what kind of product can fade freckles ?
__label__noemo	Here is the application form . I also need to see your student ID and your permission letter from the university .
__label__sadness	No , not now . I have found a part-time job.So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties .
__label__noemo	Who ’ s it about ?
__label__noemo	How many clothes of yours do you want me to wash ?
__label__noemo	Waiter , we have been waiting for 20 minutes . Would you mind hurrying ?
__label__noemo	I'm going shopping .
__label__noemo	That's too bad .
__label__noemo	What do you think of our new teacher ?
__label__noemo	I feel pity for the old man .
__label__noemo	The trouble is not that . It is that he may suddenly remember something I promised him a couple of weeks ago , out of a clear blue sky . Then he complains that I have gone back on my words .
__label__noemo	So that is product number MS2119 , Size
__label__noemo	Then go up Garden Road , past the Cathedral .
__label__noemo	All right . Over here , sir . How are you today ?
__label__surprise	Really ? But they're delicious !
__label__noemo	Oh , that's really tough .
__label__noemo	Yes , it ’ s reasonably fast but it certainly isn ’ t cheap . Fares have gone up25 % .
__label__noemo	Most of them live in the city . We provide free commuter buses for the workers . Besides , we built the dormitory building for the workers on night shift .
__label__joy	Well , Tom . It's good to meet you . I have to go now . I am teaching a class this evening , and I need to get to the college .
__label__joy	Thank you , I just tried my best . I am very happy to know you like it .
__label__noemo	Good morning . What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	So , ahem , can I interest you in any acc ...
__label__sadness	I'm afraid not , sir . Generally we can , but you know how it is in the rush hour now .
__label__noemo	So , you want it delivered the day after tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	I realize that , but our business is serving clients and giving them what they want .
__label__noemo	Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ?
__label__noemo	I agree entirely . I assure you it won't happen again .
__label__joy	Wow ! Great ! Where ?
__label__noemo	Oh , we've got plenty of time .
__label__noemo	Just black coffee . Do you serve anything else besides drinks , say cake .
__label__noemo	Don't worry , it should have been protected automatically . And I take an anti-virus software with me . Do you want me to install it now ?
__label__noemo	So fast ! Thank you .
__label__noemo	Do you love me ?
__label__noemo	Are you interested in history ?
__label__sadness	What a pity .
__label__noemo	my boss .
__label__noemo	Please ask her to call John .
__label__noemo	But I prefer warm weather .
__label__noemo	This was your first time voting , wasn ’ t it ?
__label__noemo	Can you make yourself understood in English without too much difficulty ?
__label__joy	That is exactly what we're looking for .
__label__noemo	How old is she ?
__label__noemo	Hush ! The wall has ears , you know .
__label__noemo	I am sorry . They are not available now .
__label__noemo	There are tons of other paintings that I think are better .
__label__noemo	Pretty good ! How are your parents these days ?
__label__noemo	Great ! How will we be getting there ?
__label__noemo	What ’ s the matter with it ?
__label__noemo	Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices .
__label__noemo	Shih ! ! Please keep your voice down . There are people reading and studying here .
__label__noemo	Coffee , please .
__label__noemo	Indeed.He ' s strict with himself , too.We can see every lecture of his is well-prepared .
__label__noemo	That's a good place to go at this time . How about this route ?
__label__noemo	Sure.It will depart 2 hours later .
__label__noemo	Alright , sir . I will get the paperwork ready for you . Just a moment .
__label__noemo	Sure . What's this one a picture of ?
__label__noemo	I just like the pier they have at Santa Monica .
__label__noemo	yeah , it's hard to believe but true .
__label__noemo	what do you think about her as a boss ?
__label__noemo	Let's look at our menus .
__label__noemo	Daddy , may I take your compass ? I feel so cool with it in my hand .
__label__noemo	Hush ... OK . What is it ?
__label__noemo	Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ?
__label__noemo	Please give me a few minute to calculate ... Our asking price should be about $ 100 per unit with an order of 100 . Is that price acceptable to you ?
__label__noemo	The next bus will be here in four minutes .
__label__noemo	He's a bright boy , isn't he ?
__label__noemo	Then what shall I do ?
__label__sadness	I ’ m not in the mood .
__label__joy	I'm glad that the little problem didn't ruin your visit . Please have a pleasant trip home .
__label__noemo	Thanks , sir . You too . Drive safely , I hear there ’ s a lot ice on the roads .
__label__noemo	First of all , the agenda should be prepared before the meeting . Then you should ensure that those entitled to be present are properly informed .
__label__noemo	I start next Monday .
__label__noemo	Please , where do I catch the plane for New York ?
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	There are a lot of options . You can surprise her over dinner , or ask her in a public area , or if you have the balls , ask her father in front of her .
__label__noemo	I guess so . I usually buy name-brand clothing , shoes , and electronic goods . How about you ?
__label__noemo	Yes , please tell her I stopped by .
__label__noemo	Do you know what you want to get ?
__label__noemo	Do you have a special kind of toothbrush that you like to use ?
__label__noemo	What a heavy snow !
__label__noemo	Do you put your feet on your own table ?
__label__joy	At that time her back was ramrod straight as she sailed by , her tone is best , neither over-passionate , nor too cold .
__label__noemo	Nothing . The people at the bottom give their money to the people above them , and they get nothing . They end up losing . That's why it's a scam .
__label__noemo	My present address is No . 415 Green Street . This is also my permanent address .

__label__noemo	Mom , are those tattoos on your brows ?
__label__noemo	OK . Do you have any advantages to work in our entry agency ?

__label__noemo	Yes , true , but how about other personal qualities ?
__label__joy	Really ?
__label__noemo	Sure . I've even e-mailed some people who had bought from the person who sold this bag .
__label__noemo	Nothing of that sort !
__label__noemo	That's okay . Better late than never .
__label__noemo	Got any plans after the class ?
__label__noemo	Let me have a look . Well , how many kinds of steaks do you have ?
__label__noemo	Let me tell you the story.In 1892 , Patty Smith Hill and Mildred Hill wrote a song called ' Good Morning to you ' . But later someone added the words ' Happy Birthday ' to their tune .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . I get confused that the two phones on the booth are different , can you tell me how to use them ?
__label__noemo	I love apple pie .
__label__noemo	Twenty eight dollars .
__label__noemo	I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself .
__label__noemo	Do you know which bus will take me from PHS to Sons ?
__label__noemo	In the kitchen , with his wife by his side he still puts on quite a dinner time show .
__label__noemo	well , I do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table , but I don ’ t really care for curtains . Did you get them at a yard sale ? They look ancient .
__label__joy	Oh , that ’ s such a relief . I didn ’ t want the payment to be overdue . Thank you so much .
__label__noemo	Well , then , you need an introduction . The school drama club is putting on a musical production . How about going together ?
__label__noemo	We also check your spark plugs , fuel filter , and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
__label__noemo	Don't you think it is too far ?
__label__noemo	Let's go to a ETV tonight .
__label__noemo	Try to pull it together , Vernassa . I am sure things will turn note , ok ?
__label__noemo	Five and a half years . We moved here on the first of November .

__label__noemo	Why , do we need groceries ?
__label__noemo	thanks .
__label__noemo	So , did you , did you lose your finger ?
__label__noemo	Mr . Black , I don ’ t think my boss will talk to you . It ’ s a Chinaman ’ s chance .
__label__noemo	Did you buy tickets already ?
__label__noemo	I would like to take my vacation next month .
__label__noemo	Great , except for my mother-in-law ! Sometimes I think I married her instead of my husband ! How about you ?
__label__noemo	OK , so that will bring her tip to $ 7.20 . Add it to the $ 36.00 and the total is $ 43.20 .
__label__noemo	My fees went up , but I didn ’ t even know I had fees to pay .
__label__noemo	Hi , I need to transfer some money to another account . It ’ s urgent .
__label__noemo	Kobe ? I know him , the key guy of the Lakers , a heck of a NBA player . He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense .
__label__noemo	Did I hear about it ? I saw it happen .
__label__noemo	It's us .
__label__noemo	At least more than 100 years old .
__label__joy	Of course , we are the happiest family in the world .
__label__noemo	How long would you like your haircut today ?
__label__joy	Yes , we are very proud of her .
__label__noemo	I have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . I feel exhausted .
__label__noemo	Let me have the baby-back ribs .
__label__noemo	I think you are absolutely right . Actually , my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . They got married a month later .
__label__noemo	Yes . What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	You said all that on the first date ? Alright ... Well are you two going out again ?
__label__noemo	Will the utilities be turned on ?
__label__joy	Oh really ! That sounds lovely .
__label__noemo	Yes , it does .
__label__sadness	I'm worried sick that she will leave me tomorrow .
__label__joy	Thank god ! A car's leaving . It's my turn !
__label__noemo	Which link ?
__label__noemo	Can you give me a hand with the dishes ?
__label__noemo	Oh , that's how you see it .
__label__noemo	Is the wet patch just in one place ?
__label__noemo	The ancient Olympics originated in ancient Greece .
__label__noemo	I like it very much . My name has became part of me . I don ’ t want to change it .

__label__noemo	Hope so .
__label__noemo	Yes , I am after some sugar .
__label__noemo	Please look at the sky.Don ' t you see the dark clouds ? It's going to rain soon .
__label__noemo	Ah ...
__label__joy	It looks too big for you , but I like the color and the material is good quality . Is it on sale ?
__label__noemo	You certainly had a busy day .
__label__noemo	Good evening , madam . Did you ring for service ? Who can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Any questions ?
__label__noemo	You're right .
__label__noemo	What did the nurse say ?
__label__surprise	DVD ? Isn't that like a CD ?
__label__joy	That is OK . Here is 20 dollars and you can keep the change .
__label__noemo	Take me to the airport , please .
__label__noemo	cool . We can meet up in a chat room sometime or just chat online using messenger.thanks for your help .
__label__noemo	Let's have a look at the menu . Oh , there isn't a menu . Do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu ?
__label__noemo	Fine then , what time are we going to leave ?
__label__noemo	How do you think they could be ended ?
__label__noemo	The contents should be mainly descriptions of your background . And the length depends on the particular situation .
__label__noemo	What type of movie is that ?
__label__noemo	Are the children all grown up now , Rose ?
__label__noemo	No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ?
__label__joy	Thank you . Where is the washing room ?
__label__noemo	No , should I have ?
__label__noemo	So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ?
__label__noemo	I do my shopping at Sons .
__label__sadness	I feel itchy ! I can ’ t stand it anymore ! I think I may be coming down with something . I feel lightheaded and weak .
__label__joy	Looks good . I'll take it .
__label__noemo	This is Rick Allen speaking . Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	I see an Open House sign over there , and I think we should go check it out .
__label__noemo	OK , your name and telephone number please .
__label__noemo	Our sniffer dog seems to disagree . Do you mind if we look in your suitcase ?
__label__noemo	... I knew it . I always knew you were a lesbian !
__label__noemo	How long has she been in labor ?
__label__joy	Whew ! Thanks , Karen . That car almost hit me .
__label__noemo	great minds think alike . My brother and I have been thinking about going to Tibet for quite a long time . Do you have anything on your schedule ?

__label__joy	I'd like to have some more . It's really good .
__label__noemo	And eggs ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to have prawn cocktail , and tomato soup for the main course , I'd like steak with onion , with some black coffee afterwards .
__label__noemo	I'm a quick learner , Mr.Jenkins .
__label__noemo	No , thanks . I don't like chocolate . I'd like strawberry pie .
__label__noemo	Well , Ted , this is a very impressive resume . However , we do have several other applicants to finish interviewing before we can make a final decision . We ’ ll call you by Friday , if that ’ s all right .
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__noemo	Mom ! ? ? ?
__label__noemo	I'm an athlete for the Olympic Games here .
__label__noemo	while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but I don't really care for the advertisement .
__label__noemo	Going for a walk in such a cold weather ?
__label__noemo	Our production speed is almost twice the industry-wide average . And we've already expanded the factory this year .
__label__noemo	Politics is a hard game to play .
__label__noemo	You know , it is the best seller for this year . It has had its fifth impression since its publication early this year .
__label__noemo	I don't know . Check the flyer or check with the produce person .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll also set some cups and saucers for some coffee after dinner .
__label__noemo	Nonsmoking , please .
__label__noemo	That's what will keep you from being thirsty .
__label__anger	Is's infuriating ! I have to be in Rome by five .
__label__noemo	Yes . It's a bit tight . Have you got a bigger one ?
__label__joy	Welcome ! Come in , please !
__label__joy	America ? Did you get admit to MIT ?
__label__joy	It also helps that I have strong team members , such as yourself . You really know your stuff !
__label__noemo	Yes , I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates Limited . I would like to see Mr . Smith .
__label__noemo	I am wondering if you do facial care ?
__label__joy	Yes , thank you .
__label__noemo	That ’ s right .
__label__noemo	45 yuan ? It is too much , Are you sure ?
__label__joy	Great . I'll be in later today . Thanks for calling . Bye .
__label__noemo	So are you ! How about another coffee ?
__label__noemo	Finally we have a long holiday .
__label__noemo	Bus No . 12 .
__label__surprise	Are you kidding ? Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your right .
__label__noemo	This is Wang Miao from AB company speaking . Our CEO Mr . Green has an appointment with Mr . Liang tomorrow morning . But there is a minor change in tomorrow's schedule . Mr . Green has an abrupt urgent case tomorrow and he has to go abroad today . He wanted me to convey his apology to Mr . Wang .
__label__noemo	How would you seat them ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I was just wondering when you'd have time to go fishing .
__label__noemo	Hey , buddy , can ’ t you see there ’ s a line ?
__label__noemo	Who ’ s calling , please ?
__label__noemo	Don ’ t apologize ! From the moment I met you , not a day has gone by when I haven ’ t thought of you.And now that I ’ m with you again , I ’ m ... I ’ m just scared , Veronica . The closer I get to you , the worse it gets . The thought of not being with you , I mean , I just can ’ t handle it ! We were made for each other , Veronica . You are my everything , my soul mate . What can I do ?
__label__noemo	It's forty-five yuan .
__label__noemo	that's the one . It's an actioncomedy . What do you think ?
__label__noemo	I wonder if I can ask you a question .
__label__noemo	If we let Vince and Elvin continue to run things , invoking is going to fail .
__label__joy	Hey , Mr Brown . How are you ? Look at that smile on your face !
__label__surprise	Mom , look ! My first piggy bank and it still has money in it !
__label__noemo	I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .
__label__noemo	Who do you think that has the motive ?
__label__joy	Hi ! Is that the new laptop you brought last week ? It looks very nice .
__label__joy	How much is it for my hair ?
__label__noemo	No ! Stop playing computer games !
__label__noemo	You're always welcome . Anything else can I do for you , sir ?
__label__noemo	Ok . Should I heat the wok ?
__label__joy	I ’ m thinking of making an album , you know .
__label__noemo	Yes , that's all right . I want to enroll in the course .
__label__joy	Oh , my God , three hours already ! I have to get the chores done !
__label__noemo	I see . Is the telephone on the table good for outside calls ?
__label__noemo	Across the street .
__label__noemo	I want to have a try later .
__label__noemo	Quite right . If you don't confirm , the reservation will be cancelled 72 hours before the departure time . In order not to miss your flight , I think you should pick up your ticket as early as possible .
__label__joy	Yes , that's a good place to spend a holiday . Last year I went there . It's really .
__label__joy	No problem . I'm gonna need you to turn off your engine and open the hood for me .
__label__noemo	Sure . I have it right here . 232-2453 . If that one doesn ’ t work , try 232-2456 .
__label__noemo	Is the entrance charge expensive ?
__label__noemo	Maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married .
__label__noemo	Yes , I am interested in finding a one-bedroom apartment near Washington Square .
__label__noemo	how many more games are left this season ?
__label__noemo	You don't look very well .
__label__noemo	It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__noemo	It was chosen as the most popular magazine of the year .
__label__noemo	Hello , this is the property manager . How may I help you ?
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__noemo	Um , I'd really appreciate it if you send someone over to fix it today . It's really a bother . I can't cook or take a shower .
__label__noemo	It ’ s almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild .
__label__noemo	I can't believe that .
__label__joy	Got it .
__label__noemo	I think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends , and then the right person will come along .
__label__noemo	Did you get any perks on the job ?
__label__noemo	Can you tell me something about this balance sheet now ?
__label__noemo	Do you have the classrooms open for the whole night ?
__label__joy	Oh , excellent . Why don't we talk in German for a while then ?
__label__anger	Oh . I just wanted you to shut up . You were off-key anyway . Let me see that !
__label__noemo	Could you fill in this form , please ?
__label__noemo	I can see people who are walking on the sidewalk . I can see cars driving on the streets . I can see the sun shining and beautiful flowers dancing in the wind . I can even smell the scent of flowers and the freshness of the air .
__label__noemo	Be careful . Don ’ t drop it ! Don ’ t put it there , Sam . Put it here , on this shelf .
__label__noemo	alright . How many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
__label__noemo	Why do you say that ?
__label__noemo	Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .
__label__noemo	What's the price per day ' ? And are the meals included or extra ?
__label__noemo	Let me check . Yes . Your one thousand remittance , please .
__label__noemo	I'm in pretty bad shape , Dr . Ford .
__label__noemo	But traveling is an expensive hobby , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	Why are you reading the classifieds ? What do you need ?
__label__noemo	Our regular price for Digital Barbie is $ 29.95 plus tax .
__label__noemo	London , Paris and a few other cities .
__label__noemo	No problem , sir . When are you coming to dinner ?
__label__noemo	John , I'm sorry , the air tickets for the International Day are sold out .
__label__noemo	Because I was quite interested in Economics then .
__label__noemo	I see . Well , now you can have it as long as you bring it back by nine thirty .
__label__noemo	And I couldn't find another phone .
__label__noemo	Oh , she can make her own decisions .
__label__noemo	I'm interested in taking a tour to Sydney .
__label__noemo	Here I raise a question for you . Just imagine we will have a foreign guest from Japan . Can you tell me how I ought to be to the most comfortable and polite ?
__label__noemo	No , I don't think it could be . I checked the battery two days ago.It must be other problems .
__label__noemo	What would you like to see in Beijing ?
__label__noemo	Because I feel tired all the time , even when I wake up in the morning . I find very difficult to do any work . I have no appetite . My wife cooks me delicious meals but I can only eat a little .
__label__noemo	I had a terrific working relationship with my boss , even though we are very different people . Because I've had a number of bosses , I've come to realize that to make things work , you have to understand what's important to your boss . Then you have to do everything you can to support him ( or her ) . It's natural to think about your own agenda first , but if you help your boss , Ifs likely to move your agenda ahead at the same time . My last boss was great in that regard , she appreciated my efforts and rewarded me when I helped her accomplish her goals .
__label__noemo	let me think . You could get an Indian or Thai vegetable curry , or you could get some Kimchi .
__label__noemo	what else is wrong with it ?
__label__noemo	do people in different departments get along with each other ?
__label__noemo	Well , it's all new stock in the window now .
__label__noemo	Yes , you have 2 weeks paid vacation a year , and you get it additional week after 4 years , and then again , after 9 years if you decide to stay that long , we promote from within based on performance , so there is an excellent chance that you could become a sales manager or even a region manager .
__label__noemo	ah , I don't know a fit works . Last time , all I saw the gym were bunch of lidos , like me .
__label__sadness	They turned me down .
__label__surprise	Oh , no ! Did you call the police ?
__label__noemo	Can I take your order ?
__label__noemo	I'm the coolest high-tech stud around ...
__label__noemo	No , there ’ s no need . We can change it within two days if it ’ s not damaged .
__label__noemo	That ’ s your opinion not mine .
__label__noemo	Yes , it's OK .
__label__noemo	OK I will try it . Do you have a small portion ? I am afraid I can't finish the large one .
__label__anger	No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband .
__label__noemo	To be honest , Ava , I've just had a really bad day .
__label__noemo	I think the afternoon would be best .
__label__noemo	Did you enjoy the movie ?
__label__noemo	I'd like to make a reservation to Rome .
__label__noemo	Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too .
__label__noemo	When to leave ?
__label__surprise	He still doesn't know that Santa isn't real ? How old is he , eight ?
__label__noemo	We would like to begin with a cocktail while we are waiting . Would you tell the hostess to please come and let us know when our table is ready ?
__label__noemo	OK , please put it on this scale.Airmail or by sea ?
__label__noemo	The vegetarian dishes are at the last pages of the menu .
__label__noemo	How about football ?
__label__joy	Yes , it looks interesting .
__label__noemo	Are you familiar with American-styled accounting ?
__label__noemo	Do you want to add some baby ’ s breath for that ? They are equally popular now .
__label__noemo	Do you have your insurance card with you ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . I like to do those tests , too , but I don ’ t take them seriously .
__label__noemo	It's a good thing that I have choices here . Can you tell me about the one on Saturday ?
__label__noemo	She started feeling suspicious after you said that .
__label__joy	Thanks , I like it too . I bought it at the nearby department store .
__label__fear	It's me , Ali . There's this strange guy who keeps coming around . He's been here three times this week .
__label__noemo	Is there any furniture in it ?
__label__noemo	Well , you seem to enjoy speaking English .
__label__noemo	Maybe you can come next time .
__label__joy	Bye .
__label__noemo	May I see the room ? I ’ ll take this room . Is the rate for the room only ?
__label__noemo	It's a butterfly - everyone in her family has one .
__label__noemo	I hope she ’ ll recover soon .
__label__noemo	No , I always back up my files .
__label__joy	I remembered Tom is always out of tune . We burst into laughter .
__label__noemo	Sorry . I didn't quite catch what you said.There ' s a lot of noise outside .
__label__surprise	You paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? That's a huge premium over the regular price .
__label__noemo	Yeah . Even though the customs were brilliant , I didn't think it was as good as the first two . What did you think ?
__label__noemo	I forgot .
__label__noemo	We usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
__label__noemo	We have no choice but to hold you responsible for the loss we sustained .
__label__noemo	I agree . He is also an excellent speaker .
__label__noemo	I havn't seen her for a while.She stopped seeing nick because he was cheating on her.He was seeing a girl form his office.One day , she saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately .
__label__noemo	I should think so , too !
__label__noemo	No , I have to do this ; it's important !
__label__noemo	OK , you mean the vacant one on the left ?
__label__noemo	I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ?
__label__noemo	Okay by me .
__label__noemo	Yes , it ’ s right .
__label__noemo	Of course I have .
__label__noemo	some private schools require their students to wear uniforms , but public schools don't .
__label__noemo	you ’ re right on the edge of the city , aren ’ t you ? There can ’ t be much noise or traffic there . Is it easy to get into city centre ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__fear	I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is .
__label__joy	Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb .
__label__noemo	It doesn't take much time . I ' m used to tidying up my room myself .
__label__noemo	Of course I do .
__label__noemo	You will see the beautiful city .
__label__noemo	Oh , sure . I'll be back in a minute .
__label__noemo	You , too .
__label__anger	Turn on the TV for what ?
__label__noemo	Fine , let's go .
__label__noemo	Well . I am afraid you have made a mistake . It's not the dish I ordered .
__label__noemo	I heard many stories about your brother .
__label__noemo	Janice , the president of our company , Mr Smith , will invite two programmers to give us a lecture this afternoon . Are all the members notified ?
__label__noemo	I need help with something .
__label__noemo	And only that doesn't make a perfect one , you also have to pay attention to the format of the report .
__label__noemo	Nonsmoking . Now , sir , does a single queen-size bed meet your approval ?
__label__noemo	Do you buy that newspaper every day ?
__label__noemo	What do you mean ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I have a three-year-old son .
__label__noemo	I ride a motorcycle .
__label__noemo	Yes , they were lucky .
__label__joy	Thank you for being a friend of mine .
__label__noemo	Hi , Mel , would you like to come and have a cup of coffee this afternoon ?
__label__noemo	Why do you want to work for our company ?
__label__noemo	there's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around .
__label__joy	Good . See you later .
__label__noemo	One isn't necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers .
__label__noemo	All right , Bill.Here ' s your daily exercise schedule . You are to jog before breakfast .
__label__noemo	Do you want some dessert ?
__label__noemo	I tell ya , when I got the invite , it really threw me for a loop . You've done a complete 180 .
__label__noemo	Oh , I took up a new hobby .
__label__noemo	You're right . I love it very much .
__label__surprise	Why ? You said my skirt was beautiful just now .
__label__noemo	Is it stimulating ?
__label__noemo	Who do you think will win ?
__label__noemo	Make sure you pay special attention to the street signs with time limits . Have you noticed those signs ?
__label__noemo	What are their names ?
__label__noemo	This truck flipped over on the 210 .
__label__noemo	No . Have you ?
__label__joy	Thanks , I feel the same way .
__label__noemo	Thank you . The porter will show you to your room
__label__noemo	... Who you were with ? I didn ’ t know whom you were with .
__label__noemo	I apologize , but the cable has been down lately .
__label__noemo	If you have any further questions , just ask me .
__label__anger	it was . The hijackers didn't have any respect for human life not even their own .
__label__noemo	Inbreeding is a big drawback from snitching most of their employers from one or two companies .
__label__noemo	What can I help you with ?
__label__noemo	I thought this was the emergency room .
__label__joy	Good morning . Sanyu Restaurant . May I help you ?
__label__noemo	I don't know . I like this one , and I don't have any need for all the bells and whistles you get on the new ones .
__label__noemo	I'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the IT field .
__label__noemo	No , thanks . I've had enough .
__label__noemo	Yes , I do .
__label__noemo	Hello , stewardess . Could you bring me a blanket ? I feel so cold .
__label__noemo	Actually , that's not true . Acknowledgments can help you leave a good impression on others , especially in the public places .
__label__noemo	San Yuan .
__label__noemo	I studied economics , I am especially interested in the economic development of China .
__label__noemo	Did someone get hurt ?
__label__noemo	Sure Paula , shoot !
__label__noemo	I have a Canon SLR .
__label__noemo	They will be ready in about half an hour . Do you need anything else ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry . The agreement hasn't been fully prepared . It will be ready by tomorrow .
__label__noemo	And do you have the Letter of Acceptance from the University with you ?
__label__disgust	Eventually I did get to a real person . I found out the closing time , but by then the store had already closed !
__label__noemo	That's done . There is more than enough to cover the contract amount in our account .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry for the misunderstanding .
__label__noemo	No , thank you . Taxis and I get along just fine .
__label__noemo	I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone .
__label__noemo	It's me . I have studied make-up at a beauty shop .
__label__noemo	Yes , I ’ m in Titusville . The space shuttle is launched from near there . I ’ Ve seen a lot of space shuttle launches .
__label__noemo	That is all right . Maybe we can make another arrangement .
__label__noemo	I see . Overdoing it will do more harm than good .
__label__noemo	Do you know how to skate , like a skater ?
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__surprise	Really ? In that case , could I have the number of the Service Centre please ?
__label__noemo	I want to make a reservation under the name of William Smith .
__label__noemo	Thank you , Ms Chi . What are your normal export terms ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it is .
__label__noemo	Ryan , this is Malia , and I am afraid that I am feeling a bit under the weather .
__label__noemo	What's your sales record been like there ?
__label__noemo	It's two yuan .
__label__noemo	Not so good . Lots of complains .
__label__noemo	Let me see . How about the lotus root ?
__label__noemo	Could I first ask about the remuneration package ?
__label__joy	Thank you for coming . We will have dinner outside . Eat up !
__label__noemo	My aunt Mary just flew in from Cleveland and she laid one right on my right cheek .
__label__noemo	How do you do ?
__label__joy	And then you ’ re old man won ’ t be beaten this time .
__label__noemo	We can do it tomorrow ; just call me .
__label__noemo	Who's the booking for , please , madam ?
__label__noemo	Not if you pay for it . For example , if you download from iTunes and pay with your credit card , it's legal .
__label__noemo	Ok , Mr . Smith . Do you have any bags to check ?
__label__noemo	What do you think are the main causes of war today ?
__label__noemo	Today is Tuesday , 25th September , 2001 .
__label__noemo	Here you go .
__label__noemo	You mean my favorite movie of all time ? I guess I ’ d have to say pretty woman .
__label__noemo	Our policy doesn ’ t allow anyone to check out the magazines .
__label__noemo	It's boring , right ?
__label__noemo	That's fine .
__label__noemo	No . That's not enough . I've got some cereal .
__label__noemo	yeah , me , too . It's about time I made a move .
__label__noemo	No problem .
__label__noemo	Have you arranged for someone to take notes for you ?
__label__noemo	Why bother ? Just buy a new watch . It doesn't cost much . Besides , I just can ’ t put up with this thing any more .
__label__sadness	Yes , me too . But I'm disappointed .
__label__noemo	if you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy .
__label__noemo	Thanks so much . Miss , I believe I ordered my eggs scrambled , and these are fried .
__label__sadness	Well , my mum lost her job yesterday .
__label__noemo	I have to check out today . I'd like my bill ready by 10 this morning .
__label__anger	I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair !
__label__noemo	There are a lot of wild animals in that place , and also some special rules while visiting .
__label__noemo	Is this a photo of your family ?
__label__noemo	Can I write that down ?
__label__joy	Oh I ’ m sorry . I think I ’ ll call later . Thank you .
__label__noemo	Sorry , I have no photo in my computer . And I have no scanner . I will show you later .
__label__surprise	What ! One hundred U . S . dollars.Is it covered by the insurance ?
__label__noemo	How long will it take ? We are in a great hurry .
__label__noemo	But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they ’ re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive .
__label__noemo	I guess you are right . What do you think I should do ? He wasn ’ t always this grouchy you know ...
__label__joy	OK . See you then .
__label__noemo	Yes , I have two cotton of cigarettes one bottle of whisky .
__label__noemo	I'd recommend going back to the 3rd party , personally this time , and discussing what exactly it is they aren't happy with . Hopefully you can reach some sort of agreement , which is viable for everyone .
__label__noemo	I hope nothing is wrong .
__label__joy	I ’ m so glad you told me that .
__label__noemo	I think that I might be getting the flu .
__label__joy	Oh , yes . It's a great party . There are some people I don't know , though .
__label__noemo	Oh , can you check my oil and tires while you're at it ?
__label__noemo	I suppose you need the whiteboard set up .
__label__noemo	500 pieces .
__label__noemo	For the later deposits , you can deposit any you want . Even one Yuan is OK .
__label__noemo	Hello Mr Janus . What can we do for you today ?
__label__noemo	Sounds hard .
__label__noemo	Even if the class is full ?
__label__noemo	You are free . You can go now .
__label__noemo	I wonder if we can change the temperature .
__label__noemo	Hey Joanne . What are you up to ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry I kept you waiting .
__label__noemo	We have information available about the job market as well as workshops .
__label__noemo	That ’ s where you ’ re making a big mistake ! You can ’ t just guess peoples ’ likes or sizes ! Especially with clothes or jewelry . On top of that , I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her . At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like !
__label__noemo	Let's go in .
__label__surprise	Oh ? Isn't that like her .
__label__surprise	Really ? I heard in America you can return rental cars in different cities .
__label__noemo	It's 600,000 RIB . But I've already put down 200,000 RIB , which is my absolute limit , so I'm looking for a loan of 400,000 RIB .
__label__noemo	Haven't seen you for ages.Where have you been ?
__label__noemo	yes , it's not good for me or for the environment .
__label__noemo	well , cats are certainly more independent .
__label__noemo	Yes'm .
__label__noemo	Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ?
__label__noemo	Yes , Madam , may I help you ?
__label__noemo	Certainly . Is there anything else you would like me to bring , Mr . O ’ Brian ?
__label__noemo	All right , single or double room ?
__label__noemo	Oh , yes . I love playing badminton , table tennis and computer games . And playing the games has become my favorite .
__label__noemo	How much will that run me ?
__label__noemo	Well , I ’ d like to have my coat to order.Will you take my measurements ?
__label__noemo	Unfortunately , no , I can't . But our specialist can . Please take a seat and our Mortgage Adviser will come out to see you .
__label__noemo	Do you hike or fish on your trips ?
__label__joy	Woo hoo ! This just might be the start of the rest of my life !
__label__noemo	Actually , I enjoy both .
__label__noemo	maybe you have a point . How about having a party on a Friday afternoon ? We'll stop early , order some pizza , and serve drinks . There'll be music but no band . Having the party in the office will make
__label__sadness	Sorry . We mustn't stop here .
__label__noemo	Ok , I am terribly sorry for the trouble you are getting into.We will contact you first thing , once we know the reason .
__label__noemo	Yes , I have . I was there in April .
__label__noemo	Why do you leave your present company ?
__label__noemo	If the goods are to be transshipped from one means of transportation to another during the course of the entire voyage , it's called ' combined transportation ' .
__label__noemo	Two years ago . At that time I had no problems . Now I can ’ t even make out something ten meters away .
__label__joy	My pleasure .
__label__noemo	I know . The economy here is having serious problems.But because the government declared a default , the currency value went way down .
__label__noemo	I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track .
__label__noemo	No problem . OK ... just checking for you . Ah , I'm afraid there aren't enough funds in your account to cover this transaction . What you can do is buy some US dollars , using local currency and we can credit your account with that amount .
__label__noemo	Sure , no matter what happened , they should wait to discuss in their office and find the solution in a positive way .
__label__noemo	On the bus . The driver collects the fares . You'll have to take your luggage on board .
__label__noemo	Oh , I was out sick most of last week . I ’ m still not completely over it . You ’ d better not get too close !
__label__noemo	What can I do for you , madam ?
__label__noemo	Yes . Everything's all set .
__label__joy	That sounds nice and cheap .
__label__joy	This is a great botanical garden in the city .
__label__noemo	Do you have the phone number ? I need to call for registration .
__label__noemo	Let me run through a couple of other options with you . That way , you can make a more informed decision .
__label__noemo	Yes , I have one of your buy one , get one free coupons , and I'd like to order two large pizzas .
__label__noemo	Anything else ?
__label__noemo	Let's hurry . I'm starving !
__label__noemo	Here , see for yourself . That's really strange ! It's almost the same as when I ...
__label__noemo	It is only a little pin stick . I am going to put a tourniquet on your arm to puff your veins up .
__label__joy	Yes . I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist .
__label__noemo	Does the material stand washing ?
__label__noemo	Supposing we agreed to your price , what payment terms could you offer us ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me , can you help me figure out how to get to the Wudaokou subway station from here ?
__label__noemo	Well I have to go , Rock Sam . You take it easy , OK .
__label__noemo	Store credit is okay with me . I'm sure I will find something I like . I shop here a lot .
__label__noemo	You'll only have to pay for the monthly sticker .
__label__noemo	You could inquire about the results directly , but should be politely .
__label__noemo	Sounds like this weekend just isn't going to work out for us .
__label__noemo	No , but Bean did send me like a hundred forwards today . My mailbox must have been overflowing .
__label__noemo	At 7:50 .
__label__anger	No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her with another man at a club near my home !
__label__joy	To be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
__label__joy	Yes , look at the photos I took .
__label__noemo	do you want me to get you one , too ?
__label__noemo	Good morning . You are speaking to the property manager .
__label__joy	Sure . Glad to be of service . By the way , my name is Mike Sullivan . You will see me around a lot . I am running for President of the Student Government .
__label__noemo	Make it two .
__label__noemo	I will be hanged if I lying .
__label__noemo	She is beautiful .
__label__joy	Can't beat that ! Thank you accounting guy !
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__noemo	Then what price would be fair to you ?
__label__noemo	Good , by the way , do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you ?
__label__noemo	I live on 1177 Oak lane in Smithfield . Oh , hurry , I don't know what to do !
__label__joy	Thanks , honey . It's great to be back .
__label__noemo	No !
__label__noemo	He's such a mother hen .
__label__noemo	Welcome to the electronic age ! I can run you through it ; it's what I'm here for .
__label__noemo	Then I'm afraid there's none in stock .
__label__noemo	Where'd you get those ?
__label__noemo	Don ’ t say that yet . A new project could suddenly appear .
__label__noemo	let ’ s get a chunk of cheese too . Is that everything .
__label__noemo	yeah , and most excitingly , I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice .
__label__noemo	I am new to this school and not familiar with this library . Can you help me ?
__label__sadness	It was a nightmare .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	Well .
__label__joy	January is a little too close to the Christmas holidays .
__label__noemo	Most of them in this store are from Mexico .
__label__anger	Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ’ t like your way .
__label__sadness	I don ’ t know . I didn ’ t really feel like going out . I guess I ’ m feeling a little homesick .
__label__noemo	We have Honda , Citroen and Toyota . Which make and model do you prefer ?
__label__noemo	How do you do ?
__label__noemo	Could you pick him out of a line-up ?
__label__noemo	Don't you feel dizzy when you have to get up ?
__label__joy	Bottom's up , and you're right . This meal is incredible . I wish I had known this restaurant before . Thanks for bringing me here . I know I'll be back agile soon .
__label__noemo	Well , trust me . The quality is fantastic .
__label__joy	sure . That ’ s really nice of you . Let ’ s go in and try some things on .
__label__noemo	I look at myself in the mirror . Sometimes , it ’ s not a pleasant sight , especially if I have been out late the late before .
__label__noemo	It departs Guangzhou at 10:30 on the morning of July 10 .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Alright , we are waiting for you at 7 .
__label__noemo	Linda , would you care for some candies or cookies ?
__label__noemo	If you have any problem , please come to me .
__label__noemo	Why do you want to be a tour guide ?
__label__noemo	So it's time for the kids to get outdoors ...
__label__joy	No , I've never heard of this song before . It's beautiful ! Who sing it ?
__label__noemo	As a matter of fact , I haven't danced for a long time .
__label__noemo	Good ! Do you have any questions ?
__label__noemo	Well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . I wasn ’ t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . That was the worse thing .
__label__noemo	I really would appreciate it if you could come look at apartments with me .
__label__noemo	What should we bring with us ?
__label__noemo	No , I don't like it very much . Do you ?
__label__noemo	But the guidebook says a lot of the stars come here.If we are spending three days in Hollywood , I want to see at least one star .
__label__joy	Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
__label__noemo	Well , I'd like to cash these four checks for $ 100 each .
__label__noemo	yes , the one with the R $ D team . Is that a problem ?
__label__noemo	About 7 o'clock .
__label__noemo	Can any mp make a law ?
__label__noemo	So you have to apply to begin the first semester next year .
__label__noemo	what happened to him then ?
__label__noemo	Who are you favourite authors ?
__label__noemo	Don't mention it .
__label__noemo	I'd like to have internet on my computer .
__label__noemo	No , but I was in quite a few tornados when I was younger .
__label__noemo	Good-bye .
__label__noemo	I can afford about $ 800 a month for rent .
__label__noemo	Her new boyfriend , right ?
__label__joy	Thanks a lot . You ’ Ve been very helpful .
__label__joy	Yeah , we spent the whole morning under the tall trees . We had our picnic there , too .
__label__joy	What ’ s more , he said I was the hardest working person in the office !
__label__noemo	I ’ m making a list of food and drinks .
__label__noemo	Half done .
__label__noemo	Yes , go straight along Beijing Road and turn right .
__label__noemo	Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
__label__noemo	I'm just going to let you go , since the arresting officer isn't here .
__label__noemo	Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
__label__noemo	I was hoping to get into something on campus , but my friend told me that everything is full .
__label__noemo	I've never experienced such a kind of feeling .
__label__joy	Good , happy birthday to you !
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve brought a tape with lots of children ’ s songs on it .
__label__joy	Any day except Tuesday .
__label__joy	You bet .
__label__joy	fantastic ! I got an overall score of eight .
__label__noemo	Yes , of course . Is American Express okay ?
__label__joy	Good idea .
__label__noemo	Hello . Front desk .
__label__surprise	Really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress .
__label__noemo	He's going to turn six next month .
__label__joy	My shopping life will be more convenient .
__label__noemo	How much were you supposed to write it for ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I can , but not very well .
__label__noemo	You just ate .
__label__noemo	Are you being served , madam ?
__label__noemo	Daddy , are you going to the park with us this weekend ?
__label__noemo	I help out at the children's hospital . I help plan activities .
__label__surprise	Oh , I thought there were going to be eight . who isn't coming ?
__label__noemo	Just joking , Tonia . I've got some wonderful clothes . Let's go and have a close look at your outfit .
__label__noemo	But you didn ’ t tell me in the interview .
__label__noemo	I hear that the Students ' Union is going to take new members .
__label__sadness	My washing machine isn't working .
__label__noemo	Thank you , have a seat . We are working on the new project
__label__noemo	What kind of things would you like to see on the menu ?
__label__noemo	Don't worry , do it step by step .
__label__fear	OK ! I'll call security .
__label__noemo	Well , that is the chart showing our company ’ s organizational structure .
__label__noemo	My major was accounting .
__label__noemo	I apologize .
__label__joy	Well , we were talking and catching up on what we ’ Ve been doing , talking about work and family , when all of a sudden , Matt saw a mouse run under his chair and he completely lost it ! He started freaking out , and screaming ...
__label__noemo	What for ?
__label__noemo	Thank you very much . Now , sir , do you have a credit card ?
__label__noemo	I would say it's about 5 degree Celsius .
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__noemo	Who will take responsibility for the heating system if it has a problem ?
__label__noemo	You know , honey , I used it all on the way over .
__label__noemo	Why are you so kind to him ?
__label__noemo	Why not send E-mail through the Internet ?
__label__noemo	I am going to send you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma .
__label__noemo	And do you really love her ?
__label__noemo	Next you fill in all of your hours for each day and total them . Do you know how to show time on a 24 - hour clock ?
__label__joy	Some time next year . We haven't set the date yet .
__label__noemo	That sounds very interesting !
__label__noemo	Yes , here you are .
__label__noemo	Yes . The school has provided me with full scholarship and that will be enough to support myself .
__label__noemo	Oh , hello . I'm Bias Chettri .
__label__noemo	Could I have a look at it first ?
__label__noemo	So I've noticed . You're putting on a little weight , aren't you ?
__label__surprise	Not back home for dinner again ? That's the third time this week !
__label__joy	Fine . See you later .
__label__noemo	No , thanks . We have made a reservation before .
__label__noemo	May I see a hat , please ?
__label__noemo	Could you hold the line , please ? I will check out our room availability for those days ... Yes . we have a few vacancies next weekend . We have double rooms , suites and deluxe suites in Japanese , Roman . French and presidential styles , which one do you like best ?
__label__noemo	Sure . What do you fancy ?
__label__noemo	OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese .
__label__noemo	Does she make any sense to you ?
__label__joy	Thank you for coming to see me off .
__label__noemo	Give me your water and electricity bills , please .
__label__surprise	I can ’ t believe that .
__label__noemo	Are you okay ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s becoming more and more common . However , I don ’ t ever want to get divorced myself ! What about you ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , Bob moved in last week . He is a nice guy and so far everything is cool except this girlfriend .
__label__noemo	I don't feel like breakfast . I don't feel like anything . Why are we so unlucky ? It's as if there were a jinx on us .
__label__noemo	Three days later .
__label__surprise	Really ? Why ?
__label__noemo	I'll send someone up right away .
__label__noemo	Are there many idioms in English ?
__label__joy	You are an eager beaver .
__label__noemo	I want to know at what time you close .
__label__noemo	In the morning , if possible .
__label__noemo	Where do you need to catch this bus at ?
__label__noemo	Tom , you promised to cut the lung . You won't forget , will you ?
__label__noemo	Poor child !
__label__noemo	That's a good idea . So far , we have several agents abroad .
__label__noemo	So how long have you know Jack ?
__label__noemo	What is it ?
__label__noemo	Once I contact the owners and confirm the times , I will e-mail you a schedule .
__label__noemo	Then , I'll try to find a seat in the smoking section.One moment , please . Thank you for waiting . I found a seat in the smoking section for you .
__label__noemo	Sour-peppery soup .
__label__noemo	You can catch the 486 .
__label__noemo	The total is 90 dollars including tax .
__label__noemo	How ’ s that ?
__label__noemo	I don't think we can visit the city in one day just by walking . How much does the limo cost ?
__label__noemo	Good luck finding the waitress !
__label__noemo	How's Jerry's new school ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I'm studying in the Foreign Languages Department .
__label__noemo	I ’ d like to go to the railway station please .
__label__noemo	People here desire medium-priced air freshener only . Please carefully consider my proposal , which will lead to a larger business between us .
__label__noemo	yes , but not fluently .
__label__noemo	A return ticket , please .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . I bought the CD here two days ago . It's scratched , and doesn't play properly .
__label__noemo	Believe it or not , I guess American women like a man in good shape , which Chinese women may not care about so much . That ’ s my honest opinion . I know you have been trying very hard .
__label__noemo	Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes .
__label__joy	Not too bad .
__label__noemo	That would be wonderful . Sometimes we will be working together and sometimes independently . Would that be OK ?
__label__noemo	Good afternoon , ma'am . Can I help you find anything ?
__label__noemo	Is the library open on Saturdays ?
__label__joy	Let ’ s go for a joy ride .
__label__noemo	What's wrong with him ?
__label__noemo	I would like to withdraw my money and close my account please .
__label__noemo	I've got white wine , red wine , gin and tonics , ginger ale , lemonade , orange juice , and sprite .
__label__noemo	This year our company is offering a new plan especially for single people like you . I think you might be interested .
__label__noemo	I think they went to Mexico , but I'm not sure.It ' s a bad thing to return home to.They ' ll come home from their trip , and they'll see half their house burned .
__label__noemo	I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick .
__label__noemo	True . When I tell my kids to behaves themselves , they will make a face and slip away .
__label__noemo	But I want some rice and some meat .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	I ’ m going to place a trial order for 1,000 units of a dozen fireworks and 500 cartons of mosquito coil incense .
__label__surprise	How gross ! I can ’ t handle people like that . Does he at least give you a hand around the house ?
__label__joy	It's a fine day today , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	Ok , on that day , boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate to return .
__label__noemo	I can ’ t stay here , though .
__label__noemo	I think I will continue my studies . Now it's not easy for a graduate with bachelor's degree to get a job since there are so many graduates with master's or doctor's degree . We are likely to lose in competing with them in the job market .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t you have it ? Did you lose it ?
__label__noemo	No , I don't . I've never had a bad one before .
__label__noemo	Hello , the nurse said that you might have my test results in from the other day .
__label__joy	That's really a good idea . Taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . I recommend you Qingdao or Dalian .
__label__noemo	Sorry , I'm supposed to be with my son .
__label__noemo	We can't complain about the weather recently .
__label__joy	exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ...
__label__noemo	Oh , why didn't you say it's an emergency ? Here , fill out this form and take a seat . I'll send you in next.You don't have insurance ?
__label__noemo	I want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side .
__label__noemo	No , I can't be there .
__label__noemo	I hate the hot weather . I'd rather stay indoors with the air conditioner .
__label__noemo	At what age do children start school in your country ?
__label__joy	Yes.Do you like it ?
__label__noemo	Why not buy the sweater ? It only costs 30 Yuan .
__label__noemo	He's tall and strong .
__label__noemo	Why didn't you want to go out ?
__label__noemo	And your weaknesses ?
__label__noemo	Have you found a new job yet ?
__label__noemo	This is my uncle , Charles .
__label__noemo	What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Hello . I have a room booked for tonight , the 15th .
__label__noemo	You never know unless you try .
__label__noemo	I ’ m a large .
__label__joy	Ah thank you ! I'm very excited . We were going to get married next year , but then we decided to get married on holiday instead . It was wonderful .
__label__noemo	Where are you off to ?
__label__noemo	If you log in some formal websites , it must be very safe .
__label__noemo	Is this the baggage claim area for flight KB256 ?
__label__noemo	Oh , great . Where was it ?
__label__noemo	Now please wait until your flight is called . There are about twenty-five minutes to go .
__label__noemo	Yes . But I still have some difficulties it breathing .
__label__noemo	Are you well paid ?
__label__noemo	Let me check.Well , in October .
__label__noemo	I heard about it , but I don't have any clothes made from silk .
__label__noemo	Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives .
__label__noemo	We did . On hot days , we'd take a blanket and lay in the back of dad's old pickup to watch the movie .
__label__noemo	I think it ’ s fairly useful , but there are two big problems . First , a lot of the information you find online is false . Second , when you buy something online , you don ’ t see it until you actually get it .
__label__noemo	Stop producing cigarettes .
__label__noemo	Why should I buy this MD player ?
__label__noemo	Where can we have the famous tea ?
__label__noemo	I don't think the teacher had a right to say that . The teacher was wrong to have accused her in front of the whole class .
__label__joy	It's great !
__label__noemo	Do you have any change ?
__label__noemo	No .
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__noemo	I'm going to Nanchang .
__label__noemo	You know , stage fright is very normal , most people get nervous before they have to speak in front of large groups . Just prepare well , rehearse beforehand , and trust that you will be great ... and you will be !
__label__noemo	how's it going ?
__label__noemo	I would prefer mornings .
__label__noemo	that's why I like department stores more . Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to .
__label__noemo	Only one . But I wanted to make sure I'd get it .
__label__noemo	You can take a break for one or two weeks after you have a business trip every time , which depends on the circumstances .
__label__noemo	No . The Museum is the terminal of this bus .
__label__noemo	It was boring . Just did my homework and practiced the piano .
__label__joy	I believe you are cut out for this position . You're an outstanding individual .
__label__noemo	Yes , here you are .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . I have an appointment with Mr . Li at nine . May I come in ?
__label__noemo	If you open up a card , you can save 10 % on all your purchases today .
__label__joy	My best wishes to you and the bride !
__label__noemo	You spend two weeks with dad in his ambulance as an EMT trainee and volunteer at the emergency room for one month .
__label__noemo	Britain is half the size of france , but great Britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
__label__joy	That would be great ! Is it expensive ?
__label__noemo	Would you like a cigarette ?
__label__noemo	Is it easy to locate it ?
__label__noemo	Can you tell which team seems to win ?
__label__sadness	I'm afraid not . The price is very moderate .
__label__joy	Dear , this bakery has introduced some new types of cake recently and you can eat as much as you can .
__label__joy	Sure .
__label__noemo	Thanks . I really appreciate it.In fact , I do need a letter of recommendation for this scholarship .
__label__noemo	My birthplace is Nanjing .
__label__noemo	no , I haven't had a chance to . But I've been watching a Chinese TV series called Chinese-Style Divorce .
__label__noemo	I ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .
__label__noemo	Yes , I see . five thirty AM Mr . Green , Room 1021 .
__label__noemo	Yes . I have three sons . Actually I also have a grandson .
__label__noemo	I want to stop off at my apartment to get changed so I should be there by 9 pm .
__label__noemo	How long would you like to stay In these cities ?
__label__noemo	The 4 x6 will be OK . Thanks .
__label__noemo	Would you show me this brooch ?
__label__noemo	No . I've been visiting relatives recently .
__label__noemo	How would you like the steak , rare , medium , or well-done ?
__label__noemo	Does it cost money ?
__label__sadness	I'm afraid that's a bit beyond my means .
__label__noemo	And what date will you be returning ?
__label__noemo	Certainly . How about this one ?
__label__noemo	On the whole , not too bad .
__label__noemo	perhaps one month . I'll just have a try at first .
__label__joy	And then ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it is pretty , but it costs $ 200 . What about this one ? It ’ s almost the same , but it costs half as much .
__label__noemo	Yeah . Do you know that this restaurant used to be the teahouse where we first met ?
__label__noemo	Thank you . Can I open the packages to check the color and style ?
__label__noemo	At the down town Hilton Hotel .
__label__noemo	I would like to ask for four point five million Hong Kong dollars .
__label__noemo	So you speak German , don't you ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I want to know about the battle of Gettysburg .
__label__noemo	I don't think we can meet the delivery date you suggest . It's too soon .
__label__noemo	Honey , a typhoon is coming .
__label__noemo	All right . Just a moment , please .
__label__noemo	Have you finished school ?
__label__noemo	Would you like a super size meal ? Only 2 RIB more , you'll get large coke and fries instead of medium . And today we are offering free toys all the meal boxes .
__label__noemo	That's for the wine .
__label__noemo	I don't know the reason .
__label__noemo	Ok , I ’ ll take a return ticket on the soft sleeper please .
__label__noemo	Hi . Can I help you , sir ?
__label__noemo	That's great . What's on tonight ?
__label__noemo	: How are you , Mr . Ding ? I ’ m John Brown .
__label__noemo	Yes . The board was favorably impressed with your application , but the competition was very fierce .
__label__noemo	No problem , sir .
__label__noemo	Come this way please.We ' Ve got plenty of them and they're all on the shelf near the cashier's desk .
__label__noemo	Olympus .
__label__noemo	And your company name , please .
__label__joy	Good . I'm starving .
__label__noemo	When will it begin ?
__label__noemo	I am so busy today .
__label__noemo	Do you know Chinese better now ?
__label__noemo	Can I go in to look for a job at their office ?
__label__noemo	I have all the information in this folder .
__label__joy	You really have a bid head , don't you !
__label__noemo	Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ?
__label__noemo	No , there isn't . They are all vacuumed .
__label__noemo	I'm going to try to find a place near the office .
__label__joy	Just bring yourself ! I'm looking forward to seeingyou again . It's been a long time !
__label__joy	Good-bye , and thank you for shopping here .
__label__noemo	Hello , this is Mr . Smith in Room 502 . Please send up a bellboy . I'm checking out . What time is checking out time ?
__label__surprise	What a surprise meeting you here , Landy .
__label__noemo	For three bottles of Tsingtao beer .
__label__fear	Paranoid ? I ’ m not paranoid ! I ’ m cautious ! You see Dan , we have to be on guard at all time ! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you ! Telemarketers , solicitors , even your bank ! They have way too much information ! I like to keep everything on a need to know basis .
__label__noemo	My name is Jung Min . What's your name ?
__label__joy	( After the breakfast ) Which floor is the art exhibition we are going to ?
__label__noemo	You honestly believe the world ’ s improving every year ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m actually travelling around Asia .
__label__noemo	Our state-of-the-art computer lab is on the first floor .
__label__joy	By the way , it was really thoughtful if you to get me the ticket . I really appreciate it , I'll buy some popcorn , and drinks for us .
__label__noemo	Yes he ' s in his office .
__label__noemo	What kinds of things do you like to do ?
__label__noemo	The company will pay all the expenses .
__label__noemo	Oh.history .
__label__noemo	Is it due to old age or is he sick .
__label__noemo	Mom , when you come home , please buy a coat , a skirt , a sweater ...
__label__noemo	OK , should I bring anything with me ?
__label__noemo	Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . And skipping meals will not help you lose weight . In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals .
__label__noemo	Yes , my parents , and soon my brother as well .
__label__noemo	Do you receive checks ?
__label__noemo	How about sick days ?
__label__noemo	There's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around .
__label__noemo	No problem . We always have this offer , so when ever you decide to , just let us know .
__label__noemo	Where ’ d you meet him ?
__label__noemo	What about sunday ?
__label__noemo	I'd like a gin and tonic .
__label__noemo	Here ’ s my VISA card .
__label__noemo	I don't think so . It is a little too formal . I'm probably going to wear something more laid back .
__label__noemo	I won $ 10 in the lottery last month . Perhaps next time , I ’ ll be luckier and win the jackpot !
__label__noemo	I'm afraid I can't come to work today , Mr . Smith .
__label__noemo	Country code is 81 , area code 138 , and the number is 846-8972 .
__label__noemo	I guess it Is Mrs Hill . She sued for divorce on the grounds of her husband's misconduct with his secretary .
__label__sadness	Yes , but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
__label__noemo	Well , this desktop over here is our latest model . It has a four gigahertz processor with sixteen gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte . Of course , it includes a mouse , keyboard and desk speakers .
__label__noemo	I think so . Maybe he's fallen for her .
__label__noemo	So I don't have to worry about them .
__label__noemo	You are booked , Ms . Green .
__label__noemo	What's the matter with you ? You look so upset and tired .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment .
__label__noemo	I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer .
__label__noemo	You are here on business , aren't you ?
__label__noemo	We usually recommend our clients buy US Dollar Traveller's Cheques , as they can be exchanged for local currency all over the world . They are certainly the most versatile .
__label__noemo	I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball .
__label__surprise	That sounds ridiculous . Why ?
__label__joy	It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one .
__label__noemo	What should I have brought with me ?
__label__noemo	Is she strict ?
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__noemo	Yeah ! Why not ? They are trendy and look great ! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
__label__surprise	That can ’ t be right !
__label__noemo	What is your greatest strength ?
__label__noemo	Please get a mug shot in the next room .
__label__noemo	It ’ s on the other side of this floor .
__label__noemo	Sure , John Sandals .
__label__joy	I guess I'm glad exams are over .
__label__noemo	Ok , good luck , Jessica . By the way , if you ever need a letter of recommendation , I would be happy to write one for you .
__label__noemo	What would you like to go with your steak ?
__label__noemo	my father has already paid for that in advance . Here are the receipts .
__label__noemo	When ? I saw him well last month .
__label__joy	Let me feel your forehead . I'm so glad it wasn't strep throat .
__label__noemo	Please pull your table down . It's lunch hour .
__label__noemo	Oh , yeah ? What's it about ?
__label__noemo	This one right here should be right .
__label__noemo	I didn't know you knew Frank .
__label__noemo	Could I have a word with you , Madam ?
__label__noemo	Oh , without doubt.When is the next class ?
__label__joy	Me too.You look so beautiful tonight ! I wish this night would never end.There ’ s something I have to tell you ...
__label__noemo	Don't believe him . He's a liar .
__label__noemo	Waiter , show me the menu , please .
__label__noemo	well , if you want , you can take the leftovers home .
__label__noemo	Oh ... Um ... I don't think so . you know the halogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting system . Plus I'm going to have to call in some guys to install it for you . That's not going to come cheap .
__label__noemo	But I'm not sleepy , Mum . Can I stay and watch more TV ?
__label__joy	Would you , please ? Thank you .
__label__joy	I bet you had a wonderful time
__label__noemo	well , then why aren't there many East-West couples where the man is a Chinese and the woman is a Westerner ?
__label__noemo	Room service . May I come in ?
__label__joy	Thanks . That ’ s terrific !
__label__fear	Let me have a look . Whoa ! Get away from me !
__label__noemo	Hello ! You have reached the offices of Maddox and McKnight , can I help you ?
__label__surprise	Really ? Then just ask her to follow me .
__label__joy	Will it be a church wedding or a civil ceremony ?
__label__noemo	What if the results from the two inspections do not coincide with each other ?
__label__noemo	Your starting salary is 2500 yuan a month , and after you become a permanent employee , it will be higher .
__label__noemo	First you put your money in the dollar slot or the coin slot . The dollars have to be smooth .
__label__noemo	Nice to meet you , Lvan.My name is Alike . I'm from Japan .
__label__noemo	Me too . If we don ’ t do something soon , It might be too late .
__label__noemo	Ok , as John after Kennedy put it , let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate .
__label__noemo	I think I ’ ll stay in on Saturday and rest .
__label__noemo	I will be letting you know during the year if you have a major problem .
__label__noemo	the professor is a bit boring today . You need something to perk yourself up . How about a coffee ?
__label__noemo	That's too bad . Well , where are you fishing ?
__label__noemo	Yes . It depends . If you have a large order , we will give you a discount .
__label__noemo	that's alright . I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information . It almost drives me crazy .
__label__noemo	Possibly , but I still miss them ! What bothers me is that the heat makes the caddies ' life quite hard . One member's caddy fainted last week !
__label__noemo	I had no idea .
__label__joy	How nice seeing the sun back again ! The air is so fresh .
__label__noemo	Why only $ 300 ?
__label__noemo	No , but we went to the Kennedy Center .
__label__noemo	What note ?
__label__noemo	That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .
__label__noemo	Let's get down to business .
__label__noemo	Then when do you think we could go out together ?
__label__joy	Cool phone . What kind of phone card do you want ?
__label__noemo	Which would you recommend ?
__label__noemo	But it makes the place feel so much like Christmas . I ’ d really hate to have to take it down .
__label__noemo	What kind of people do you find difficult to work with ?
__label__noemo	I'd like a bottle please .
__label__joy	OK , here you are . You look really attractive in that gown .
__label__noemo	no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know .
__label__noemo	15 days . The transportation by air will take five days .
__label__noemo	And we're going to have summer vacation .
__label__joy	Okay . BBS , an online service , offers a wide variety of online games , files , one-on-one chat , message areas , private mail , and participate forums .
__label__noemo	I sent out a notice . You've stopped checking your e-mail ?
__label__noemo	Well , maybe they've got a point . I mean , I suspect that they think the same about us .
__label__noemo	Of course I have plenty of time . What's new ?
__label__noemo	Hello , 35 ..
__label__noemo	We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike .
__label__noemo	It ’ s the same color . It ’ s green , too .
__label__noemo	I am looking for a growth opportunity , which I feel is not available at my current employer . In terms of skills , I am Microsoft certified in Windows XP and several other operating system
__label__surprise	Really ?
__label__noemo	What's up ?
__label__noemo	No , not at all.His examples are really interesting .
__label__noemo	you know I hate shopping more than anything else in this world .
__label__noemo	You and Patricia got engaged , didn ’ t you ? You can tell me .
__label__noemo	Oh , I almost forgot . It's my mum's birthday Saturday . I need to get her some more Chanel . Could you get me the 1.7 ounce bottle of Chanel cologne ?
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__noemo	Two hours.That area is a little backward .
__label__noemo	Really , well , OK . Get the receipts out .
__label__joy	I'm honored that you think I would be qualified . But I would really have to think about this first .
__label__noemo	is it available in the rooms ?
__label__noemo	You think so , how come ?
__label__surprise	Are you serious ?
__label__noemo	It is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active .
__label__joy	With pleasure . I suppose you dance often .
__label__noemo	Four months ago .
__label__noemo	Ok . Does he know your number ?
__label__noemo	That's a pity . Does Friday suit you ?
__label__noemo	I don't want to talk about it .
__label__noemo	How can I help you ?
__label__noemo	You know why ?
__label__noemo	Not really . Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre , especially in the main shopping areas . The public transport system is pretty good .
__label__noemo	It began leaking a couple of days ago .
__label__noemo	I know , I am sorry I ever bought it .
__label__noemo	Will that be all ?
__label__noemo	Well , right now , we can't afford internet use in the rooms . But you can go to the web bar in our hotel . It's on the 12 floor .
__label__noemo	Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
__label__noemo	Here's your change . Thank you .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I noticed . She must be really loaded .
__label__joy	I enjoyed talking to you too .
__label__joy	Oh , thank you ! It's very kind of you . Ah , it is a porcelain vase .
__label__joy	I really appreciate your kind words .
__label__noemo	Alright .
__label__noemo	At his last start-up , Bob worked for stock and no salary . They folded and he made zip .
__label__noemo	How many pieces of baggage do you have ?
__label__joy	I love it . I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . It gives me a real sense of satisfaction . Do you enjoy cooking ?
__label__noemo	that will probably be quite expensive , but the more you pay for the fabric , the longer it'll last and the better it'll look . What color do you want the suit to be ?
__label__noemo	He never does , and in fact , he seldom communicates with him .
__label__joy	Good morning , Miss Bell !
__label__noemo	Mary , can you help me set the table ?
__label__noemo	Fine . What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a boss and his or her employees ?
__label__noemo	Here's eight dollars . Keep the change .
__label__noemo	Any other facilities ?
__label__noemo	You mean Johnny threw out all the dinnerware ?
__label__noemo	He said he will get married by the end of this month .
__label__surprise	Are you serious ? You studied mathematics at college for four years , and now you have a job working with your hands !
__label__noemo	I'm getting a bit plump myself . Perhaps I ’ ll go with you .
__label__joy	Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ?
__label__noemo	Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced .
__label__noemo	By American express , if that's ok .
__label__noemo	How about the iguana ?
__label__noemo	No , I'm afraid I don't . I'd be glad to learn .
__label__noemo	I like listening to different kinds of music .
__label__noemo	I really appreciate your offer , but I have to decline it , because I have already taken another job which I prefer to work in .
__label__noemo	Yes . Why ?
__label__noemo	I want it the way Peckham wears it .
__label__noemo	No , nobody .
__label__noemo	And how ’ s everyone in your family ?
__label__noemo	I think that it is around 600 .
__label__noemo	Maybe you're right .
__label__noemo	I think everyone will be coming . Dave don ’ t come because he has to go to his parent ’ s home and they live in Scotland .
__label__noemo	Oh I didn ’ t go . I stayed at home with my family .
__label__noemo	One thing you can be sure of your manager will be quite fair . If your job performance is up to par , you shouldn't be afraid of a performance review ,
__label__noemo	Yeah , it is , a little bit . I joined the Great Outdoors Club , though , which has been a lot of fun . We've gone on two camping trips already , and I've made some good friends .
__label__joy	Thank you , Peter . Come into the dining room . We are going to cut the cake soon .
__label__noemo	What ’ s up ?
__label__anger	But there's a bus every ten minutes , and you are over 1 hour late .
__label__noemo	How are they at swimming ?
__label__noemo	I'll give you some tablets that should make you feel better . One moment , please . Here you are . Take these tablets three times a day swallow them with water .
__label__noemo	How many more fund units would you like to purchase today ?
__label__noemo	Just a few shirts .
__label__noemo	Good day , what can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I was awarded the title of Advanced Worker last year .
__label__noemo	Listen . I will see what I can do , ok ? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now . She is your wife and I am sure she will understand .
__label__noemo	Hey doc . Well , I think I might need glasses . I ’ m getting headaches , and I really struggle to see things that are far away . But I have always had 20/20 vision .
__label__noemo	I got a bachelor ’ s degree .
__label__noemo	Any time . If you have a good idea , don't be afraid to speak up.This is a company that appreciates initiative .
__label__noemo	After you .
__label__noemo	Where do you live ?
__label__joy	This will not interfere with my work . I promise you that .
__label__noemo	I have something really cool to tell you about ! Do you know anything about online auctions ?
__label__noemo	That would be okay if I had an Ethernet port . Unfortunately , my laptop uses wireless only .
__label__noemo	All right . Please read it to me .
__label__noemo	What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ?
__label__noemo	First I want to check about the availability and see if you could give me more information .
__label__noemo	No , it will not be formal at all . It is a fun time . You will love the game show . Please dress casually . Usually there is an over abandon of drinks , so be careful with that .
__label__noemo	If you agree to pay more money , you could upgrade the carpet .
__label__noemo	Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .
__label__noemo	Which university should I apply to ?
__label__noemo	I need it done today .
__label__noemo	I don't think so . Your admirer seems kind of sweet . Aren't you even a little curious about him ?
__label__joy	Oh , so he's half Chinese and half American . That's unusual . What languages does he speak , then ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I have brought them with me . Here they are .
__label__noemo	Look at this newspaper article about this famous local medium . It says that she is really gifted and so popular now , that she is booked solid with appointments for the next twelve months !
__label__noemo	Fund info , the fund code , fund net value per unit , fund public info , fund account balance , fund trading conformation , daily details and the history . With our Net Banking , anything is possible !
__label__noemo	I'm afraid you can't , ma'am . We accept only traveler's checks and credit cards .
__label__noemo	Can you put me through to Mr . Lining ?
__label__noemo	How can I find out if I can collect ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I think she is just a little bit crazy .
__label__joy	OK , I'll take it .
__label__joy	I ’ d like to conduct some scientific research into genes . It would be wonderful to make a medical breakthrough .
__label__noemo	Would you like to join the drama club ?
__label__noemo	Absolutely . Here it is .
__label__joy	It's not expensive . I'll take it .
__label__noemo	Did you hear the good news ?
__label__noemo	I realize that , but I am not guilty .
__label__noemo	sorry , Brad . But you are going to have to re-do this .
__label__joy	This is the kitchen.Every - thing's new .
__label__noemo	Hi . How can I help you ?
__label__noemo	This job provides full medical , dental , and disability .
__label__noemo	The workmen oughtn't to leave it without a no tice .
__label__joy	Good luck !
__label__noemo	You said it .
__label__noemo	Before we begin eating , I'd like to present everyone with a gift from Taiwan .
__label__joy	Bob is in advertising .
__label__noemo	well , I like to play darts . Whenever I go to a bar , I usually play for a few hours .
__label__noemo	but you look quite proficient in using them now .
__label__noemo	Oh ... and ear muffs ! Put these on ... here we go .
__label__noemo	Yes , most of them think it's good . But , some people have different opinions . They consider we should arrange some challenging activities .
__label__noemo	Until we meet again .
__label__noemo	Here , Let me get the door for you .
__label__surprise	Huh ? What ?
__label__noemo	And I'll stick with real coffee .
__label__noemo	I have an appointment for half past one .
__label__noemo	How am I going to get home ?
__label__noemo	Yep . Here it is . What do you think ?
__label__sadness	But I ... I still love him ! And it ’ s all my fault ! I can ’ t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean , he is a firefighter , it ’ s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I ’ Ve totally messed this up !
__label__noemo	Yes . Five one-dollar stamps , please .
__label__noemo	ok .
__label__noemo	Sorry , sir , but I recommend you Bacardi White . It's quite delitous .
__label__noemo	Yes , It's Henrylee@yahoo.com .
__label__joy	The seats are excellent . We're right in the center .
__label__joy	Good for you . What items did you bid on ?
__label__noemo	What did they take ?
__label__noemo	Probably my parents .
__label__noemo	Have you written down your return address ?
__label__noemo	Oh , Ben has been cooking for us since I started attending this evening class . The good thing is , he has made great progress in cooking .
__label__noemo	It's a bit disappointing that they are all out for a movie .
__label__noemo	I need your library card .
__label__noemo	Yes . Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states .
__label__noemo	Will you apologize to her ?
__label__noemo	Is this your first time here ? Where are you going ?
__label__noemo	You have to help to the laundry today .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t know . I didn ’ t really feel like going out . I guess I ’ m feeling a little homesick .
__label__noemo	I'm Li Ming from CITS . Glad to see you .
__label__noemo	Mainly because we've invested in a heat recovery system .
__label__joy	That sounds good . Did you study cooking in school ?
__label__surprise	Kathy ! How are you ? It's been ages ! What are you doing these days ?
__label__noemo	Thanks .
__label__noemo	OK , here it is . Can you hear it ?
__label__noemo	It's May 1st .
__label__sadness	Doctor , I have the worst toothache !
__label__noemo	When do you go ?
__label__noemo	An hour ? That's a bit of a bummer . Let me take a peek and see what else there is . How about going dancing ? We haven't done that in a while . There's a club in Silver Lake that's supposed to be hopping on Friday nights . Eddie from work told me that they have a really good DJ and a big dance floor , and the cover charge isn't bad .
__label__noemo	I see that you have some impressive writing experience .
__label__noemo	It ’ s rather cold . Isn ’ t it
__label__noemo	Yes . I ’ m calling from Westwood and Westwood Attorneys . I need to make a reservation for Mr . Alex Brent .
__label__noemo	I have some lotion that the doctor gave me , as well as an antihistamine .
__label__noemo	Here's the same pan , but it has a space-age , heat-resistant plastic handle .
__label__joy	That sounds wonderful . Will there be anyone there that I know ?
__label__noemo	When would you like your account closed ?
__label__noemo	You know , that ’ s going to be a tremendous change for me . Because I never exercise .
__label__joy	I have been accepted by Oxford University on PhD .
__label__joy	No , thank you .
__label__noemo	Hello , Anna speaking !
__label__noemo	I hook up to the Internet every day . I can't believe I didn't do that .
__label__joy	Amazing ! I can imagine the feeling when I hear the smooth tune around my ears .
__label__noemo	Yes it is down there , at the end of the road , next to the supermarket .
__label__joy	OK , bye for now !
__label__joy	Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one .
__label__noemo	But I see things rather differently.The heroin is not attractive and her acting is just so-so .
__label__noemo	Return the money to Jim and make an apology . I think he will forgive you .
__label__noemo	Yeah , everyday . And there ’ s only one choice.All the other buses are going the other direction .
__label__joy	It looks good on you .
__label__noemo	That's right .
__label__noemo	Sure . But it's a very difficult one , you need to have a dictionary at your elbow .
__label__noemo	I heard that the owners must fix all of the problems before the escrow closes .
__label__noemo	Have you got the number ? I'll call them right now .
__label__noemo	I see .
__label__noemo	Of course . How about you ?
__label__noemo	I just saw her down the street . I don ’ t know where she is . I don ’ t know ...
__label__noemo	No . I'm sure I know her .
__label__noemo	Normally , they're $ 2 each . Today , they're only $ 1 each .
__label__noemo	I want to finish my degree in four years.So I don't want to forget to take classes I need . I have a friend who has to stay in college another year.She didn't know until recently . There were some classes she needed to take to graduate.She didn't know about them .
__label__noemo	actually , I've only got a two-seater . I'll have to go on my own .
__label__noemo	Newspapers or the radio I guess . I just wish TV was more objective .
__label__noemo	No . Please don ’ t . I couldn ’ t let you do that .
__label__noemo	Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly .
__label__noemo	Thank you . Is that a window table ?
__label__noemo	A house would be great . I could plant a garden . And you could use the garage for a workshop .
__label__joy	Come on , you sound like my Mom.Look at it , it's beautiful !
__label__noemo	By air of course .
__label__noemo	Where do you think you lost it ? Outside the hotel ?
__label__joy	... and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet . I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley , smiling and laughing in the rain ...
__label__noemo	Dark , maybe dark blue maybe black . I'm not sure .
__label__noemo	In half an hour . The surface of the lake is calm .
__label__noemo	Do you feel comfortable with the new system by microcosm ?
__label__noemo	Hi , I was just coming to see you.But since you made the trek to my office , you get to go first .
__label__noemo	I ’ d like to try traditional Chinese medicine . I heard it really works quite well if you know what you're doing .
__label__noemo	Certainly , Sir . I'd be happy to . The Personal Pledge Loan is a loan secured by undue certificates , Time Deposits , for example , or Visible Treasury Bonds .
__label__noemo	You usually are good about turning it in ; what happened ?
__label__joy	It's more violent than TV news !
__label__noemo	Hello , Susan , it ’ s me , An .
__label__noemo	Yes.Here ' s my identification .
__label__noemo	What seems to be the problem ?
__label__noemo	Mr . Rodriguez was asking me about it yesterday .
__label__noemo	A Mac it is . I'll take one home with me .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'd like to look at some suits .
__label__noemo	Do you have the package with you ? I would have to weigh it to see how much it would cost .
__label__noemo	Whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean .
__label__noemo	You have gone against the traffic rules .
__label__noemo	Please switch work shifts with me .
__label__noemo	I want to take a look at that home with the Open House flags out front .
__label__noemo	Yes , he sure does.In fact , he wants to become a movie producer himself.He wants to study film at the university .
__label__noemo	Master card . Here you go .
__label__noemo	So you don't have much related work experience .
__label__noemo	Here's a twenty .
__label__noemo	Do you take credit card ?
__label__noemo	Son , you just go back to bed , and stop crying wolf .
__label__noemo	Pretty good , Sam . Only the awful weather , you know .
__label__noemo	I'm attending PCC right now .
__label__noemo	How about you , Daniel ?
__label__noemo	I'm still feeling under the weather .
__label__noemo	It has a built-in hard-wired memory , but I like to use the 64MB media cards that come with it . I can download everything onto the hard drive and then edit and enhance with different software . It takes fantastic pictures that I can either print out or E-mail to my friends .
__label__noemo	I am sorry . I ’ Ve left my disk at home .
__label__noemo	Check your answers against the ones on the answer sheet and let me know where you see the mistake .
__label__noemo	Yes.But I recommend you to buy pantyhose . The stockings are already out-dated .
__label__noemo	The toilet flushes really slowly .
__label__joy	Hello , Rachel . It's glad to see you here .
__label__noemo	Oh , I see .
__label__joy	Count me out .
__label__noemo	how about the lyrics ?
__label__noemo	According to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day .
__label__noemo	Twilight rates are 21 dollars .
__label__joy	Thank you for saying . I think you are light on your toes too . Oh , the music starts again , would you like to have another dance , miss ?
__label__noemo	Yes , thank you very much . In addition , do you have the marketing proposal ready ?
__label__noemo	it's Beethoven . Do you like it ?
__label__noemo	I'm afraid there aren't any left at the moment . Gan you wait just a little while ?
__label__surprise	Steve . Is that you ?
__label__noemo	What ’ s good today ?
__label__joy	Oh , I know Tangyuan . It ’ s a sweet snack , good for dessert .
__label__noemo	The guy in the blue shirt at the table by the window .
__label__noemo	Well , I used to be size fourteen , but I've put on a bit of weight recently , so may be sixteen .
__label__noemo	He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you mine it is a good age to have a child ?
__label__noemo	As a reporter , he must have acute insight and language skills . At the same time , he must have good judgment , the respect for his job and tactical cooperation with others .
__label__noemo	No , but I am starting working out from now on .
__label__noemo	I intend to stay at home for the whole seven days and have a good rest .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid that a button is missing .
__label__joy	Really ? I am too happy .
__label__noemo	Come on ! You can just walk up to a girl and say “ If you were a booger I \ ' d pick you first . ”
__label__noemo	Please sign here .
__label__noemo	Around five thirty .
__label__noemo	And they said you should play classical music ?
__label__noemo	Could you tell me the right time , please ?
__label__noemo	They're right upstairs .
__label__noemo	It is said that The Hurt Locker got the Award of Best Picture . What do you think about this ?
__label__noemo	I hope so .
__label__noemo	I thought that you had your own parking spot ?
__label__sadness	I think it ’ s too expensive . I can just give you 4 yuan . Or I ’ ll go to another B .
__label__noemo	Surely , of course . What kind of currency have you got ?
__label__noemo	Not at all , guys also get facials , manicures and pedicures . There is nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good .
__label__joy	Well , you know I studied marketing in America.So maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me . I'd love to be part of the team .
__label__noemo	Do you want a furnished house or an unfurnished one ?
__label__noemo	Thank you . Do you have a credit card , Mr . Sandals ?
__label__sadness	Darling , can't you stay for a few more days ?
__label__noemo	Well , it's snowing . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms when snowing .
__label__noemo	I went to see it the day it came out .
__label__noemo	Are you going to vote ?
__label__noemo	Office address , please . He might be at work when they arrive .
__label__noemo	To each their own !
__label__noemo	thank goodness we're not rich and famous !
__label__noemo	How much is the ticket for ?
__label__noemo	Hello ! I'm sorry to bother you . This is a complimentary fruit tray . Your food will be ready soon .
__label__joy	Yeah , you ’ re right . Can ’ t go wrong with that .
__label__noemo	Hey ! Do you still remember our teacher of economics , Mr . Locker ?
__label__noemo	I'm not sure , but I don't think she's given out that many .
__label__noemo	Ah ha ! I caught you . Just let me peek . I won't tell anyone .
__label__noemo	I ’ m awesome . Well , I guess that ’ s my answer , isn ’ t it .
__label__joy	I sure will .
__label__noemo	I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
__label__noemo	Paul , is this Paul , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	Give me 10 yuan , your ID card and a photo of you please .
__label__noemo	ok . I ’ ll put the plates and cutlery away as I dry them . Where is the tea towel ? Oh , here it is .
__label__noemo	My mum and my sister do the housework and cooking but I clean my room .
__label__noemo	sounds like a good idea , but a band sounds too expensive .
__label__anger	It ’ s infuriating . I have to be in Rome by five .
__label__noemo	But you should be considerate to the kids , it ’ s their nature to play .
__label__noemo	alright , tell me what you think .
__label__joy	It ’ s Asian fusion . I heard it ’ s delicious .
__label__noemo	OK . Would you like me to get you a cab ?
__label__noemo	I'm planning to return to China after graduation .
__label__noemo	Have you decided on something ?
__label__joy	Yeah , I guess I can survive until tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Of course . You'd better learn something about it .
__label__noemo	I really feel great shame . Let me buy a new one for you .
__label__noemo	I'm going to the English class.It ' ll start in five minutes , I've got to run .
__label__noemo	I learned about different tax laws and how they work .
__label__noemo	Yes , I am an outgoing person who likes to be with a lot of friends .
__label__noemo	You're so witty ...
__label__noemo	sure , you should prepare so that you can give proper response when you're being interviewed .
__label__noemo	Now for the most difficult question . What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ?
__label__noemo	I'm not going anywhere until later , so I'll clean it then .
__label__noemo	Instead of tackling somebody , you just have to touch them with two hands , or if it is flag football , grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing .
__label__noemo	First of all , I need to share what the purpose of a home inspection is . Do you understand what I was doing there ?
__label__noemo	a crate of beer ? Why do we need that ?
__label__noemo	You have worked in your present company for five years .
__label__noemo	This is Mr.Gao . How are you ?
__label__noemo	Not yet , what's your opinion ?
__label__noemo	You're right . Watching movies at home is way cheaper than going to the theater , too . I like downloading movies too because it's easy and fast .
__label__joy	Bye .
__label__noemo	You'd better prepare for the examination .
__label__noemo	Well , I would be glad to , but I have promised Tom to see his Christmas tree , and play the piano for his song tonight .
__label__noemo	How about the repair fee ?
__label__noemo	How has May been ?
__label__noemo	Tom ... you are her boss , you down . Of course , she's helpful to you .
__label__joy	Great idea . And after all , that's the whole point of an evaluation . I almost can't wait to give it a try .
__label__noemo	I hear the school is very modern . It has the best equipments .
__label__surprise	Oh , okay . Can I do that right now ?
__label__noemo	Just that in effect , a basic Letter of Credit is a financial contract between the bank , the bank's customer , and the beneficiary , and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	How about these ? They are the current bestsellers .
__label__noemo	The export Business Section .
__label__noemo	That happens often these days . Well , please fill in this Report of Theft .
__label__noemo	Are you sick ?
__label__noemo	No , sir . We left directly from the hostel .
__label__noemo	What do you mean ?
__label__noemo	That's fine . Maybe you should be more careful .
__label__noemo	Hey John , nice skates . Are they new ?
__label__noemo	What else can you speak ?
__label__noemo	All you really need to know is that the apartment looks great .
__label__noemo	Are you going to be home so I can come by and take a look at the problem ?
__label__noemo	Why do you think you might like to work for our company ?
__label__noemo	An outside table is available right now if you would like to be seated immediately .
__label__noemo	It's 626-555-1739 .
__label__joy	With the greatest pleasure ! Where is the concert held this evening ?
__label__noemo	How much are you asking for every month ?
__label__noemo	So I take it you're pretty bored too .
__label__noemo	And can you tell me what meetings I have this week ?
__label__noemo	I know how goals are scored in football , but how about in rugby ?
__label__noemo	Yes , but not including overtime pay . I'm looking for a salary slightly higher than my present one , with opportunities for raises if I work well .
__label__noemo	Oh , I'm afraid I can't . I've had a date already .
__label__joy	OK !
__label__noemo	Well . Tornadoes can be dangerous , it's true.If we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t be angry with me . I have a bad memory .
__label__noemo	Yes , thank you .
__label__noemo	Right . Well it seems like you have all your bases covered . What ’ s next ?
__label__noemo	I know what you mean . I could use a vacation myself .
__label__noemo	What are you and Corey doing for Valentine ’ s Day this Friday ?
__label__noemo	See you in the court .
__label__joy	Good . How much is it when we take it ?
__label__noemo	Yes , we do deliveries for orders over $ 15 , ma ’ am .
__label__noemo	No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill .
__label__joy	OK . Thank you .
__label__noemo	I ’ m afraid ... be can returned by eleven o ’ clock .
__label__joy	Certainly , that's easy . We will work out our CIF offer this evening . Could you come again tomorrow , say , at 10 AM ?
__label__noemo	There is too much static on the line .
__label__noemo	You're very kind to say so . Thank you . Do you think tomorrow morning would suit him ?
__label__noemo	Mom , am I like a superman ? All I need is a cape .
__label__joy	Yeah , I ’ m dealing with it . Anyway . Thank you , Mike .
__label__noemo	Hello . I would like to speak to your director of human resources , Ms.Jenkins , Please .
__label__sadness	I don ’ t think they are right . I have tried my best and that's enough . It is unfair that they are always saying these thing . Sometimes I even feel deeply hurt .
__label__noemo	Because it's impossible to improve listening level within a week .
__label__noemo	Did you stay up late last night ?
__label__joy	well , now that I know that , maybe we should all go out for dinner sometime .
__label__joy	Thanks , but actually I was hoping I could ask you to write my biography .
__label__noemo	My old man does not allow me to go back later than 11 p . m . Bye !
__label__noemo	Yes , but whom to ?
__label__sadness	OK , but don't forget I'm here for you , and I know how you feel . It's my loss , too .
__label__noemo	How soon before this goes through ?
__label__noemo	Are you looking to get a steel-string or a classical ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I am applying on it .
__label__anger	Stop running around in front of the TV , will you ? Why don ’ t you just sit and watch ?
__label__joy	I hear you are moving to Dalian .
__label__joy	I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling !
__label__surprise	Are you sure ? He is quite young , isn't he ?
__label__noemo	7 o'clock tonight and there will be 5 persons .
__label__noemo	What is the purpose for your visit ?
__label__noemo	What happened to this book ?
__label__noemo	For water retention , I am going to start you on Hydrochlorothiazide , which is a diuretic .
__label__noemo	He's just a distraction , like a mosquito buzzing in my ear . I want no distractions .
__label__noemo	sounds interesting . Where did you get the idea ?
__label__noemo	Simple . We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences .
__label__noemo	It's a curio cabinet . The only thing is I don't even own those kinds of little keepsakes .
__label__joy	well , now you don't have to worry about that . This new place sounds really good .
__label__joy	It must be most precious .
__label__noemo	Just one . I noticed an item about flex-time.Is that a possibility for me ?
__label__noemo	Where did you empty the basket , Bill ?
__label__noemo	I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?
__label__noemo	Do you want to play poker ?
__label__anger	You're spending a very long time on my hair .
__label__noemo	I believe that two people did get hurt .
__label__noemo	Everything I need is on the list .
__label__noemo	How did you get it ?
__label__noemo	We have a two-for-one special on large pizzas.Would you like a large pizza instead ?
__label__noemo	I saw a pair of earrings outside your window . Can you show them to me ?
__label__noemo	The first step is to determine your eligibility for a U . S . visa . Let's see here ... you're applying for a special business visa . Why is that ?
__label__noemo	All right . We have quite a selection for you to choose from . There are double rooms with twin beds , suites , if you'd like , we have presidential suite on the top floor .
__label__noemo	Okay . Um ... can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
__label__noemo	I can teach you how .
__label__noemo	And you ’ re going to completely transform your eating habits , right ?
__label__noemo	Well , anyway , he'd somehow lost his wallet and his house keys , so he couldn't get in . He lives alone , you know .
__label__noemo	The rent is 400 yuan a day .
__label__noemo	Working . Why ?
__label__noemo	You're right . I think it ’ s time to seek professional help .
__label__noemo	Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ?
__label__noemo	Hello , Catherine . Would you like to go out tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	No problem . Actually , we have some great packages . The most exciting season of Hawaii is now . How about a relaxing vacation in Hawaii ?
__label__noemo	When will you be able to fix it ?
__label__noemo	Maybe we can trade.Why don't you stay here and read for my exam , and I'll go drink beer ?
__label__noemo	Of course not , I appreciate that .
__label__noemo	Well , his son had an accident and Bill doesn ’ t have health insurance . This really got me thinking , and I wondered if we shouldn ’ t look into a couple of different HMO ’ s .
__label__noemo	Nothing but the best , Cinnamon toast .
__label__noemo	Hello . I'd like to have my nails manicured .
__label__sadness	I know . I know . I'm really sorry . I lost my bag .
__label__noemo	No . I haven't had a chance to read the paper yet .
__label__noemo	I had no clue that I could get it there .
__label__joy	Thank you , I will be doing my best .
__label__sadness	Sorry , we ' re sold out right now.Please come back next week .
__label__noemo	I just thought it would be an interesting way to see lots of places . How long will it take ?
__label__noemo	Can you help me set up my voicemail message ? I just got this service and I am not really sure what I am supposed to say .
__label__noemo	Forget it ! If you think I ’ d ever set foot that inferior restaurant again , you gotta be nuts . Last time I ate that food , almost vomited . The service in there is terrible . It was the first time I ever stiffed a waiter
__label__noemo	a couple of times a week . i've got a regular dancing partner . he is really some dancer
__label__noemo	Sure . May I take your measurements ?
__label__noemo	I am all ears .
__label__noemo	You know you didn't .
__label__joy	Oh , you shouldn't . But thank you very much .
__label__noemo	We came back the day before yesterday . I enjoyed myself there very much . The beach is beautiful . You should go there some day . The sun was lovely , too .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t think this place is for you .
__label__noemo	Well , you do that when your nose needs blowing . I was talking about a way to make your throat heal faster .
__label__noemo	Have you been coming to this Laundromat long ?
__label__noemo	that's good to know . I'd like to try more Chinese food , but since I can't read any of the menus in the restaurants near my home , it's difficult to try new food .
__label__noemo	What is the date today ?
__label__noemo	I need to return these books .
__label__noemo	That's right . And in my opinion , to push the sale of the new products is not an easy task .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes . That's fine with me . Maybe we can have lunch together .
__label__noemo	I would've thought that somebody would have told you .
__label__noemo	Didn't we make that appointment a long time ago ?
__label__joy	Same here ! We will catch up soon , maybe over coffee !
__label__noemo	Oh , forget it then . Hey , I told you to put the files on the in tray , not on my desk .
__label__noemo	that's a lot of cooking . You must save a lot of money by eating at home so much .
__label__noemo	Body language in the interview is closely related to the job-hunter's image .
__label__noemo	Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry about that , sir . I'll get you another one .
__label__noemo	I did not know that .
__label__noemo	Can I have the receipt ? Just in case I can trace it if something goes wrong .
__label__noemo	Sure . So you should know how to deal with the probable questions and then make flexible reply .
__label__noemo	Can I have your boarding pass ? We need to stamp it .
__label__noemo	Study , study , study . I want to learn a lot .
__label__sadness	I know . Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy .
__label__noemo	I'm not sure , he didn't say when he wound return . If you'd like.you can leave him a message until he is back to you until the moment it's free .
__label__joy	I'm glad that you see it that way .
__label__noemo	I teach English .
__label__noemo	What would you like for dessert ?
__label__noemo	Ever since I saw computer can do your project , I wanted to have a computer .
__label__noemo	I will have to give you store credit , Ma'am . If you find something else you like in the store , you can use the credit .
__label__noemo	That's great ! It's not my day . I just have very bad sense of direction .
__label__noemo	No , but we have it in yellow .
__label__noemo	I don't . I like the work .
__label__joy	It's been nice talking to you .
__label__noemo	We are all tea drinkers . Please bring us four teas .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I think that's what I'm going to have to do .
__label__joy	Yes , thank you . I ’ Ve already been helping myself .
__label__noemo	Hi Jane , you look great .
__label__noemo	Why ? What was it about ?
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__joy	That's great ! You need to prepare for it .
__label__joy	I'll be fine with just my girly drink , thank you very much .
__label__joy	And they're really safe . They'll protect your ear from sound damage .
__label__noemo	I hope I can practice self-control again .
__label__noemo	I ’ d like to get away from the big city life .
__label__noemo	May I know what you do ?
__label__noemo	I see . I think I ’ d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again .
__label__noemo	Does that include utilities ?
__label__noemo	But even with the overhead out , the export overhead must be put in . Finally , it comes to the same thing . Anyway , this is a quality item and should be sold on its value .
__label__noemo	Not at all , I was totally in the dark .
__label__noemo	Yes . I like wearing shorts in summer . My legs would freeze !
__label__noemo	OK . Have you filled in the Declaration Form ?
__label__noemo	So how ’ s everything going for Christmas ?
__label__anger	I can ’ t stand being with you anymore . I'm sick of your drinking .
__label__noemo	It's fried sole .
__label__noemo	What could be worse than what you just told me ?
__label__joy	I ’ d like to take this opportunity to thank you for everything you did for me .
__label__noemo	Explain the economic law ? An essay question again ?
__label__anger	That's horrible . Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work ?
__label__noemo	Heard what ? No one ever tells me anything .
__label__joy	Good , you can make your dream come true here .
__label__noemo	Mmmm ... it's hard to say . I like golf a lot-but I guess I like tennis better .
__label__noemo	Yes , that's the reason why I remain here .
__label__joy	This is good food , it has milk , fruit , grains , nuts ...
__label__noemo	Adidas . Size 38 .
__label__noemo	Then what shall I do ?
__label__noemo	What's the best way downtown ?
__label__noemo	Well , I ’ Ve attended some conferences in this field . But the most relevant training I ’ Ve had was in computer design . I believe I could integrate that knowledge with my college degree to design
__label__joy	Thank God !
__label__noemo	ok , got it . I ’ ll call you sometime next week .
__label__noemo	I think it's a very complicated issue . A part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers . Don't underestimate the good ole ' boy system . Men have power , so it's easier for them to stay in power .
__label__noemo	But it's already awfully close .
__label__noemo	Can you help me plan the office party ?
__label__noemo	Yes , twice last week .
__label__noemo	What about my resume ?
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__joy	you're here a bit early , so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . Here's your boarding pass . Enjoy your flight !
__label__noemo	I am confused about the projected revenues .
__label__noemo	The rent each month is $ 1050 .
__label__noemo	Good afternoon , Mrs.Vale . Please sit down .
__label__joy	It's OK .
__label__noemo	You mean there may be credit problems ?
__label__noemo	They are , yes . How should I do this ?
__label__sadness	I don't think you really want to hear about it .
__label__noemo	Let's just hope it doesn't get cold again .
__label__noemo	Did you bow back ?
__label__noemo	Yes . Farther away from the highway it was very quiet and there were birds and squirrels everywhere . We counted over twenty squirrels .
__label__noemo	My name's Donald Eakins .
__label__noemo	Yes , I would , as long as it's good quality .
__label__noemo	No , mom . I haven't seen it .
__label__surprise	Sign ? What ’ s sign ?
__label__noemo	Either one is OK .
__label__anger	I don ’ t want to .
__label__noemo	It sure does .
__label__noemo	Well . It's hard for me . I can't keep doing exercise .
__label__noemo	You're getting that hot stuff in my mild broth !
__label__noemo	They spend hours there , especially on weekends .
__label__joy	Yes . We had a big talk with him , and he has really turned over a new leaf .
__label__noemo	So , you're a serious coffee drinker .
__label__noemo	I am calling to tell you some issues about the interview .
__label__noemo	I usually go on holiday during the spring or the autumn . I try to go somewhere where the weather is more reliable than in my city .
__label__noemo	I'm a student .
__label__noemo	I know what you mean . I think Shanghai is getting more and more expensive , don't you ?
__label__noemo	I am applying for the waiter in your pub .
__label__noemo	Light pink .
__label__noemo	I can help you . What location are you looking for ?
__label__noemo	Well , first you have to turn this switch on .
__label__noemo	What kind of currency have you got ?
__label__noemo	Honey , where did you buy this skirt ?
__label__noemo	My favorite winter sport is skiing . In addition , I am keen on basketball .
__label__noemo	There ’ s no catch ! You just choose a plan , sign a three-year contract and , that ’ s it ! Actually , we ’ re running a special promotion right now , and we ’ re giving away a Blackberry Curve with our special Mega Value forty dollar plan .
__label__joy	Sure , thanks . I brought you a bottle of wine as well .
__label__noemo	I fired Mr . Li today .
__label__noemo	It's said that the government will clamp down on the new policy .
__label__noemo	Yes , I nearly didn't sleep last night .
__label__noemo	I suppose so . Hair cut , please .
__label__joy	So am I .
__label__joy	Like disco ?
__label__noemo	Well , how was the interview ?
__label__noemo	You ’ re getting married in three weeks . So that should be ok . So , you ’ Ve prepared the church , catering , transport , hotel-everything .
__label__noemo	hello , do you remember me ? I bought some vases from you yesterday .
__label__noemo	How long will it take to get my clothes back ?
__label__noemo	Can you offer the Five Insurances for me ?
__label__noemo	Good afternoon . Welcome to Lincoln Bank , how can we be of service ?
__label__noemo	Okay , is there anything else ?
__label__noemo	Sorry . I feel like sitting out the next dance .
__label__noemo	How are the clubs different in Japan than in London ?
__label__noemo	And a storm blew our roof away .
__label__joy	Nice meeting you , too .
__label__noemo	Not too near but not too far either . A taxi will take you there in 15 minutes , If the traffic is not too bad , I mean .
__label__joy	It ’ s great , dad . I don ’ t mind delivering papers , but the real fun is collecting the money .
__label__noemo	Yes , including a description of the shirts you want to purchase this time , the total amount of your order , the price for each piece , mode of payment , packaging , shipping time , insurance and compensation , claim and arbitration , and rights and duties for both sides . Are all the terms here satisfactory ?
__label__noemo	But there is always somebody who wants to turn his back on the true history .
__label__joy	you're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me !
__label__noemo	Here it is .
__label__surprise	Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory .
__label__joy	No , thanks . I've had enough . Now , Mary , before you blow out the birthday candles , you have to make a wish . After that , you may cut the cake .
__label__noemo	Wonderful . Then how many employers have you worked for ?
__label__noemo	What you said is absolutely right . I will pay you back as soon as I get back on my feet .
__label__noemo	It doesn't matter .
__label__noemo	Yes , that's in the past . Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help .
__label__noemo	I've got an old Ericsson . Here . Take a look .
__label__noemo	I am interested in one-bedroom . Do you have any available ?
__label__noemo	The current owners will be moving out on Tuesday , so technically you could pick up the keys and move in on Wednesday .
__label__noemo	Hello , what can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Late in the afternoon , after work .
__label__noemo	You have made a big progress . Quitting smoking is not an easy job . But it will be rewarding in the long run .
__label__noemo	Not too bad .
__label__noemo	My mattress was supposed to be delivered today .
__label__noemo	I also think good advertising is essential to call attention to a product and introduce our L-series products . Meanwhile , ads are also the representation of the company's image .
__label__noemo	May I see your ticket please ?
__label__noemo	I'm so happy you remember , please come in and enjoy the party . Everyone's here , I'm sure you have a good time .
__label__noemo	That's right .
__label__noemo	Is the driving test difficult ?
__label__noemo	Four and a half going on twelve !
__label__noemo	Certainly .
__label__noemo	Detective books .
__label__noemo	Oh , my birthday is in December just before Xmas so of course nobody remembers .
__label__noemo	How long have you been studying English ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me . Do you happen to have a gym here ?
__label__noemo	Very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
__label__noemo	I hear we ’ ll have a new English teacher this semester .
__label__noemo	Please fill in this admission card . Well , how long do you expect to stay in the hospital ?
__label__noemo	say hello to your friends for me .
__label__noemo	That will be a tough match , right ?
__label__noemo	That's right . He ran for office quite a few times before he was finally elected .
__label__noemo	To be honest , I'm a bit fed up .
__label__noemo	This is our new brand . I can make sure our computer board is one of the best boards .
__label__noemo	When is a good time to catch him ?
__label__noemo	Alright . See ya !
__label__noemo	What for ?
__label__noemo	Yes , all our rooms have complimentary wireless Internet .
__label__noemo	How can you do that ?
__label__joy	Great ! Our president has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the Beijing Hotel at 7:00 . Here's an invitation card for you .
__label__noemo	But you know it's hard for a new graduate to find a job right now .
__label__noemo	I think we should go for two weeks . We could spend a week in the bush and a week at the great barrier reef-including a few day on the beach for tired office workers !
__label__sadness	Oh . Hi Matt . I went snowboarding yesterday and my whole body aches .
__label__noemo	The water will not drain .
__label__noemo	Yes.Are you interested in the job ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I think it is .
__label__noemo	It can't be that bad .
__label__joy	I heard it ’ s a very good movie .
__label__noemo	Welcome to ABC Company . We have been expecting you , please have a seat . I will call him .
__label__noemo	As an experienced interviewer , could you tell me what kind of behavior the interviewer hates most ?
__label__noemo	I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market .
__label__noemo	For some reason it won't turn on .
__label__joy	Now that's a great plan . It's a date !
__label__noemo	I hope not . Then we'd have to reschedule our baseball game .
__label__noemo	And what would you like for dessert ?
__label__joy	Wow ! ! !
__label__noemo	We are going to have a party tonight , would you please look after our baby tonight ?
__label__noemo	Hi , I'm Susan Jackson .
__label__joy	Fred is really a good guy . And he loves you so much .
__label__noemo	You mean the network connection ?
__label__noemo	Yes . You could use five or six units.But five or six wouldn't be very efficient . I recommend seven .
__label__noemo	My husband is an American . He criticizes me when I do that . He says that I can ’ t change a child ’ s behavior by using force . He is learning what I am doing now .
__label__joy	That ’ s great ! I ’ m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . Is Pear still interested in having those ?
__label__noemo	sure , my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way . They ’ re pretty satisfied with it .
__label__noemo	I'm doing it for fun and fitness .
__label__noemo	How much does it cost ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much , Your Honor .
__label__noemo	Certainly . It ’ s actually the Chinese New Year and is regarded by the Chinese as the most important holiday of the year .
__label__noemo	Not much really . It's more of an American tradition , so back home we don't really celebrate it . In fact , I am not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated !
__label__noemo	You can wash the vegetables and cut the chicken and I'll make dinner !
__label__noemo	How much is it ?
__label__joy	Maybe it's a good things . If you don't have to go to Hong Kong , you can take a break and take things easy for a while .
__label__noemo	I should take the taller one for the choice .
__label__joy	A picnic lunch would be a nice thing to have along .
__label__noemo	I'd love to do that . What do you recommend ?
__label__noemo	OK , that ’ s fine . Bye .
__label__noemo	How much do you want to draw ?
__label__noemo	No , the burn ointment seemed to take effect right away . I think it's already healed .
__label__noemo	Good morning . I want to deposit 3,000 yuan in your bank .
__label__noemo	Oh , I know it . It is included in extreme sports . I think it's too dangerous for me .
__label__noemo	Ok . That sounds easy enough . Have you called any of them yet ?
__label__noemo	What do you need to buy ?
__label__noemo	Sure . I'm J McQuillin and my number is 323-555-6840 , extension 42 .
__label__noemo	Not really . I wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . Do you want to go with me ?
__label__noemo	Forget it , there is no use crying over the spilled milk .
__label__noemo	Here is the wine list .
__label__noemo	Well , things are all right .
__label__joy	Bob and Mary are back together .
__label__noemo	Hello , miss . Where is the button that controls my seat ?
__label__noemo	It's fish steamed and served with our special sauce .
__label__noemo	Hi , Alex . How are you doing ?
__label__anger	I told you to hurry up a thousand times . You just put a deaf ear to it .
__label__noemo	It's nothing personal , just business .
__label__noemo	No , they are peppermint chocolates .
__label__noemo	Seventy cents a piece .
__label__noemo	Get some eggs , milk , and bread .
__label__joy	I have just had my new paper published .
__label__noemo	Yeah . This is a clever way to be in contact with such a person .
__label__noemo	Great , do you still remember when he started his voyage ?
__label__noemo	Maybe it's because Susan's parents are both painters .
__label__noemo	yes , I just adopted her from the humane society this weekend .
__label__noemo	Hey , Susan . Have you got a sec ? I have some questions about my paycheck .
__label__noemo	How long have you been like this ?
__label__noemo	As a matter of fact , I would like to work in South America . So some Latin language like Spanish or Portuguese would work .
__label__noemo	Well , how was your honeymoon ?
__label__noemo	Fine , just get it ! We have been shopping for furniture for five hours ! I ’ m so tired !
__label__noemo	Besides , yours don't have side pockets like mine .
__label__noemo	It sounds good now , but I'm traditional . I want the degree , so I wouldn't have accepted the offer .
__label__joy	That looks great . Just one more thing-you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
__label__noemo	No , I don't have any hobbies . How about you ?
__label__noemo	Bye .
__label__noemo	When will you be free ?
__label__noemo	One class is on Tuesday and Thursday from 2 p . m . to 4 .
__label__noemo	I offer you 110 yuan .
__label__noemo	Would you please ask when he will be free ?
__label__noemo	That's all right . Please ask me if you don't know how to do something next time . You can keep the silk dress if you don't mind . I think it fits you .
__label__noemo	Oh , yes .
__label__noemo	But why is it too late ? It's Saturday night.You have nothing to do tomorrow . Why not stay out and drink with us ?
__label__joy	Many times . Except climbing , there are many attractions worth visiting .
__label__noemo	Will it be too late if I call around ten this evening ?
__label__noemo	How am I supposed to log on to the computer ?
__label__noemo	Well I ’ m definitely a team player as well as being highly self-motivated . I believe this company can fulfill my long-term goals and offer me great upward mobility . Therefore you will find in me
__label__noemo	To the beach
__label__noemo	Well , I was hoping you would do me a big favor . That was supposed to be a rush order , I forgot to tell you . I ’ m getting a lot of flak from my boss .
__label__noemo	Is she your teacher ?
__label__noemo	Can I have my money back on this skirt ?
__label__noemo	Sure . Let me get it out for you . What is your size ?
__label__noemo	Why are you switching jobs at this point in your career ?
__label__noemo	Yup , it ’ s all set .
__label__noemo	You are welcome .
__label__surprise	Really ? Why ?
__label__noemo	Glad to meet you .
__label__noemo	I ’ m kind of useless in that area , but I ’ ll take a look at it .
__label__noemo	All right , sir . Would you lie back so that I can shave you ?
__label__noemo	What kind can I get ?
__label__noemo	No , I haven't had a chance to take the exam as I have just arrived here .
__label__noemo	That will probably take care of your symptoms . I ’ ll see you tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Love stories ? More like one-night-stands .
__label__noemo	Fine . If you'll excuse me , I'd like to go it over first . ( After about 15 minutes ) Hmm , you've done a pretty good job . It's well prepared .
__label__joy	What an attractive place ! How can I get there ?
__label__joy	I'm glad that you could get back to me so fast .
__label__joy	Yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ...
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Yes , millions of travelers come here every year for the view of the buildings .
__label__noemo	How would you like it ?
__label__noemo	Shall we arrange a bail boy to pick up your luggage at nine o ’ clock ?
__label__noemo	I seldom heard the quarreling of her children .
__label__noemo	Take it easy . When we last talked , you promised there would be more exercises in your life . But now you are putting on some weight .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'd like to have this parcel delivered to Shanghai .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t be silly , John . I ’ m going with you . It ’ s necessary for me to have a holiday too .
__label__noemo	McCain won the election .
__label__noemo	I go to the gym every day to keep fit .
__label__noemo	We're just worried about you , Taylor .
__label__noemo	Is this your first year in college ?
__label__noemo	I can ’ t keep up with the game . The players play so quickly that I can hardly see what they are doing .
__label__noemo	Therefore , we must be very careful in building up clear expressions and complete understanding on both sides of trade .
__label__noemo	But where's the switch ?
__label__noemo	What's the matter , sir ?
__label__noemo	Bill Black , Room 1201 .
__label__noemo	Hi , Jack , how have you been ?
__label__noemo	But the private school amount to better schools .
__label__noemo	Do you have any sunscreen lotion ?
__label__noemo	That's correct . With DEL you can do both .
__label__noemo	He got the money and tried to leave .
__label__noemo	Hey Jack . How were your classes this semester ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s about fifteen minutes ’ walk . That ’ s all .
__label__noemo	Bye .
__label__joy	Ok . I'll call you later when I get a tee time .
__label__noemo	Not yet . I feel too lousy to go out.Anyway , I have a flu . I know what it is . I don't need a doctor to tell me that .
__label__joy	there's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight .
__label__noemo	Can you say it again slowly ?
__label__noemo	Well , we have a package tour there .
__label__surprise	It's huge !
__label__noemo	Which ones are you referring to ?
__label__noemo	It usually takes about half an hour .
__label__noemo	Where ’ s what wagon ?
__label__joy	Yes , could you please go over this for me ? And see if there is any mistake in it ?
__label__noemo	have you checked your voicemail recently ?
__label__noemo	What time are you leaving ?
__label__noemo	But I think they're dull , aren't they ?
__label__noemo	Not particularly . I was rather disappointed .
__label__noemo	In Camden Town .
__label__noemo	Well , you can just see the sea . Between the factory chimneys .
__label__noemo	Oh . Yes . Sometimes it rains very heavily
__label__noemo	This is room 1425.We asked for the room service an hour ago .
__label__noemo	Thank you for your assistance , Mr Bush .
__label__noemo	How about the cinema ?
__label__noemo	Did he get caught ?
__label__noemo	Good afternoon Miss , would you be interested in buying more life insurance ? You know , you can never get enough .
__label__noemo	My luggage is in the corner over there . They are the leather suitcase , the canvass holdall and the blue backpack .
__label__noemo	Well , we'll supply you with an apartment of a bedroom and a living room .
__label__noemo	A laboratory assistant helps to maintain scientific equipment , keep a check on the supplies in the store , and prepare the chemicals for experiments .
__label__joy	The five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive .
__label__noemo	I ’ m hungry , let ’ s go grab a bite to eat .
__label__surprise	25th Sep ? Oh , I have an appointment tonight .
__label__noemo	Lucy Green .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . Could you tell me how to get to the library ?
__label__noemo	For four days or so .
__label__noemo	Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education .
__label__surprise	How is it you don ’ t know ?
__label__noemo	And the problem with Jack is that he seems to have no interest in girls . He's putting his heart into his stamp collection .
__label__disgust	All the routine work really browns me off .
__label__joy	That is a wonderful choice .
__label__noemo	I understand .
__label__noemo	What's that ?
__label__noemo	So it ’ s really the same story . Practice , practice , practice and more practice is the only way to learn a language .
__label__noemo	Who is the next one ?
__label__noemo	Yes , you are responsible for keeping all files in order .
__label__joy	I don't think I say this enough , but I want to thank you for your kind listen patience , you ' Ve always been there for me .
__label__noemo	That ’ s right . But I have bothered him several times .
__label__noemo	Well , I haven't thought much about this . I think it's too early to tell . What is the most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible . If the company is happy with my work , then , I think I would like to consider other positions in the company .
__label__noemo	This is our first day of class.It ' s better for us to introduce ourselves to each other . Who would like to begin first ? Any volunteers ?
__label__noemo	good for you . I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months .
__label__noemo	When do you want to move in ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m afraid there is , Greg . I don ’ t mind you taking a break . But you ’ Ve been away from your desk for twenty-five minutes already .
__label__noemo	What's up , Robert ?
__label__noemo	You are so lucky !
__label__noemo	This one .
__label__noemo	The road ahead is blocked . There might have been an accident .
__label__joy	Of course not . You can come to London to visit me in future . And I also will come here if I have a chance .
__label__noemo	That's true . And sometimes the tickets are cheaper during the week as well .
__label__joy	I think that I will , thanks .
__label__surprise	Oh , Madam , buy what ?
__label__joy	the bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ?
__label__noemo	Weren ’ t you frightened ?
__label__noemo	Are you going to be okay ?
__label__noemo	I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put in for a transfer ?
__label__noemo	At the end of the interview , you should make your acknowledgements and say Goode .
__label__noemo	Yes , there are many famous corporations .
__label__noemo	Hello , Mr . Sun .
__label__noemo	Oh , yeah , let's try to find some jobs .
__label__noemo	But they are closed today .
__label__noemo	What colour is it ?
__label__noemo	Well , I am very serious about learning Chinese.But for me the hard part now is pronunciation.You have the four tones in Chinese . It is very hard . Maybe , if you have time , maybe we could do a language exchange .
__label__noemo	How many cigarettes do you smoke a day ?
__label__noemo	Hi . Last month , our company , Turner Interiors of Beijing , ordered some documents under our new L / C . What I want to do is check and see if the documents have arrived yet .
__label__noemo	Do you have a boyfriend ?
__label__noemo	The People's Park is located on Nanjing Road , near Limbo road , just on the opposite side of the International Hotel .
__label__noemo	Have you ever thought about Tom ’ s attitude ?
__label__noemo	In a word , dressing and appearance are indeed important , but it should never be all .
__label__noemo	Yes , Five one dollar stamps , please .
__label__noemo	Yes . I would like some information for requesting a loan .
__label__noemo	I want to have a haircut .
__label__joy	Yes , there might be some food you have never eaten before .
__label__surprise	What ? Why ? I mean ... just like that ? I ’ m fired ?
__label__noemo	Wait a minute . I think we have missed an important point . We should include an arbitration clause in the contract .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , is this seat taken ?
__label__noemo	I'll wait right here for you Superman .
__label__surprise	really ? I didn't know that it was against company policy .
__label__noemo	Yeah , it is my favorite . Many Chinese people including women and children would like to concern the game . I think they want to see the performance of coming and YiJianLian , the Chinese players in NBA .
__label__noemo	Hello Mrs Parker , how have you been ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I didn't watch the football match . I wanted to but my wife preferred to see the old film .
__label__joy	Helen , did you hear I ’ m having a party ? Next Saturday in my place .
__label__noemo	But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
__label__noemo	Though everything may be as you say , there are many factors involved . What's more , your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage .
__label__noemo	Why are they stricter with Chinese people than with other nationalities ?
__label__noemo	OK , Let me see . I suppose we must strengthen our promotion , because our brand is still new to some consumers . Maybe we should start our advertising program with our local and overseas distributors simultaneously , because they stand on a better position for selecting the best ways to advertise in market places . Besides , the advertisement fund can encourage them to spend more attention on advertising our products .
__label__joy	He was . He was friendly toward and showed concern for everyone he met .
__label__noemo	Oh , can I ?
__label__noemo	Sure . Most facials start with a thorough cleaning . Then we usually use a toner to invigorate the skin , followed by exfoliation treatment-a peeling mask or scrub that removes the dead cells that make the skin lock dull . After that , we'll massage your face and neck with oil or cream to improve the circulation and relieve the tension , followed by a mask to moisturize and soften the skin .
__label__noemo	From August fifth to eighth . Just a moment . Yes , we have a vacancy for that period . What's your name , please ?
__label__noemo	I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars .
__label__noemo	All my games are so lame , Mom . When can I get a new one ?
__label__joy	Thanks for coming ! We should meet again sometime soon .
__label__noemo	Ok , I will .
__label__noemo	Hello ?
__label__noemo	Wonderful .
__label__noemo	Sounds like it was meant to be .
__label__noemo	Have you met the new manager in customer service ?
__label__noemo	I'm still not sure about these ' Visible ' Certificates . What's the real difference , except the amounts available ?
__label__joy	That ’ s a good idea . You are a fireman and it can be a dangerous job .
__label__joy	That sounds ideal . Could you show me some ?
__label__noemo	Yes , sir . How would you like to pay the bill , sir ?
__label__noemo	No , thank you . I'm just looking . Maybe later I might need your help .
__label__noemo	Very well . What about you ?
__label__noemo	When you eat out , do you usually eat from the buffet ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either .
__label__noemo	By the way , does acupuncture hurt ?
__label__noemo	Hi , I ’ m Paul . Could you show me the apartment on the first floor ?
__label__noemo	How long will you be staying ?
__label__noemo	Yeah , sure . Your total is seventy-eight dollars and thirty-three cents . Here is your receipt . Have a nice day .
__label__noemo	Sky worth .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'm teaching math at Lincoln High School .
__label__noemo	Most of my songs are sad , sorry .
__label__noemo	Yes , please .
__label__noemo	I was wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
__label__noemo	Good morning , Textile Import & Export Company .
__label__noemo	That will work .
__label__joy	Yes . Thank you for inviting me .
__label__noemo	Well , we are only responsible for the retirement pension . About the unemployment compensation , this will be given by the government .
__label__noemo	I really have to go .
__label__noemo	May I take a look inside ?
__label__noemo	Okay , you take one end and I'll take the other .
__label__noemo	Hi , Linda , I'm just calling to invite you to a dinner party tomorrow evening .
__label__noemo	Well , the only thing you can do is pay the fee to recover your service .
__label__noemo	Come and meet her now .
__label__noemo	I'd like to go to Suzhou next week . Do you know how to get there by train ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry , he is not here at the moment . He has gone to the International Business Center .
__label__noemo	When I have time , I sometimes draw and paint .
__label__noemo	Not really , to be honest . Some of what they call fashion looks terrible to me .
__label__noemo	Yes , we will .
__label__joy	Wow , what a beautiful lake ! The green hills and clear water really provide magnificent scenery .
__label__noemo	It is . You must be new here . I do my shopping here regularly , once a week .
__label__joy	Thanks then Sally . Goodbye .
__label__noemo	Thanks , dear . I feel so tired after a whole day's work .
__label__noemo	OK , I know where this is going . How much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
__label__anger	I don't think that you're done .
__label__noemo	I see . You want to have your goods shipped from New York to Osaka via Hong Kong , where they can be transshipped . Is that the idea ?
__label__joy	The western films about America's cowboys , Indians and early settlers .
__label__noemo	Really ? Do I have to do it ?
__label__noemo	Hmm . . . well , maybe we can buy this one then .
__label__noemo	I think I know , because this happened before .
__label__joy	That will do . What an interesting picture ! How old is it ?
__label__noemo	Christmas has more religious nature , while our Spring Festival is a more traditional holiday . On the New Year's Eve , we have a big dinner called ' Family Reunion Dinner ' . One of the traditional food to eat at the dinner is dumplings . After that , the adults usually sit chatting , watching TV , or playing cards .
__label__noemo	That's understandable . Well , rather than comparing my salary with someone else's , perhaps we could talk about my job performance . Surely you've noticed the extra hours I've put in recently ?
__label__noemo	Take care , Peter . Don't run so fast.Are you tired ?
__label__sadness	Thank you , but I really want to relax myself . I ’ m very sorry .
__label__noemo	Yes . We have both the paperback and the hardcover .
__label__noemo	My major was computer science when I was at college , and I am quite familiar with Visual C + + and Java language .
__label__noemo	Hi , I'm John Sandals , and I have a reservation .
__label__noemo	There will be a party in my company ; what shall I wear ?
__label__noemo	I know . I have an idea that we get together to discuss this next week .
__label__joy	Oh , photography , It ’ s really a good hobby .
__label__noemo	Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law .
__label__noemo	Thank you , but my friend is in the library , and he can give me a ride home .
__label__noemo	Honey , just turn down the stove .
__label__noemo	It is nice . Is it water proof ?
__label__noemo	Well , don't get bend on a ship about it .
__label__joy	We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .
__label__noemo	And now we have a two-year-old boy . We ’ re very happy that he ’ s healthy and smart .
__label__noemo	We are such weirdos right ?
__label__noemo	no mistakes in a tango Donar.not like life , simple , that will make the tango so great . if you make a mistake , you'll get all tango done . just tango along . why don't you try ? will you try it .
__label__noemo	But what about parking ? You can't park on the street , can you ?
__label__noemo	Mike has changed much after marriage .
__label__noemo	Thank you for all your help .
__label__noemo	Don't worry . We won't be the first .
__label__noemo	I'm not sure which would be better for me ; buying some insurance or putting my money in a Savings Deposit .
__label__noemo	Oh , I see , Sir . Well , it does take 5 working days to issue and post the card .
__label__noemo	Have they set a date for the wedding ?
__label__noemo	Oh , no . When we were poor , we often tried our best to make ends meet . It was a hard time .
__label__noemo	The chicken is also nice .
__label__noemo	I ’ d like to work in marketing . I think I could have a good career in that field .
__label__noemo	I can imagine .
__label__noemo	This is your first Christmas in the US . Here is the gift for you .
__label__joy	Come on .
__label__noemo	This is the Bell Captain's Desk . May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Would you show us the menu ?
__label__joy	Wonderful . Will we have any free time there ?
__label__noemo	Yeah . That's just what is troubling John .
__label__noemo	Well , I am telling you now .
__label__joy	I see . What ’ s it like there ?
__label__noemo	Is it useful for me ?
__label__noemo	So we can get down to business .
__label__joy	Thanks .
__label__noemo	I know , I left it at home .
__label__noemo	Hello , I would like to apply for a permit .
__label__noemo	What's the matter , Lisa ? You don't look too good .
__label__noemo	Keep your voice down . We'll talk more later . Right now I need to see Vince .
__label__sadness	Laura ...
__label__noemo	is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets a preposterous price , and the buyer tries his best to bring it down , until a compromise is reached . Yet you ignored the process . No wonder you ended up easy prey .
__label__noemo	Please remember to use both English and Chinese versions and both versions should be equally valid .
__label__noemo	I recommend you this route . We call it golden routes for the sightseeing spots .
__label__noemo	I think they are quite reasonable , and the vegetables are very fresh .
__label__noemo	I ’ Ve been to all of them .
__label__noemo	Well , I've got one here . It's 260 a month .
__label__noemo	Mary , could you please come in for a short while ?
__label__noemo	Would you like a home near the lake or would you prefer a view ?
__label__noemo	It was purchased on the 12th of November at 3
__label__noemo	Fine , and after dinner , shall we go to a disco ?
__label__joy	Yes . We enjoyed ourselves very much . Have you traveled much , Luke ?
__label__noemo	It's made of cotton .
__label__noemo	My boss gave me a big project . I had to have it finished by this morning . It was so difficult .
__label__noemo	You better do some exercise every morning .
__label__noemo	What kind are you going to make ?
__label__noemo	It suits my taste , I'll take it . Do you have lighters ?
__label__joy	Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together , don't you think ?
__label__joy	Great . I'll call and make reservations .
__label__noemo	We wanted to live in a more peaceful community and have more space . Another reason is , we can afford to buy a home here , but we can ’ t in Chicago !
__label__noemo	What's your title in the company ?
__label__noemo	And not expensive either .
__label__noemo	Hi , Mr . Smith . what's new ?
__label__joy	I absolutely love it .
__label__noemo	I see . I'm from Taiwan , so I know regular characters better than simplified .
__label__noemo	That sounds reasonable . I'll be down there immediately .
__label__noemo	Oh , I am sorry . What's on Channel 2 at 10 pm ?
__label__noemo	Hmm . He might really appreciate that . I know he will start to collect movies at school . Especially if he studies film .
__label__noemo	Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen .
__label__noemo	Thank you . I don't think there should be any problems , but just to be sure ...
__label__noemo	Well , go home and rest in bed for two days , then you'll feel better .
__label__noemo	Well , may I leave a message ?
__label__joy	Thank you !
__label__noemo	How would you like your eggs ?
__label__noemo	What exactly does that mean ?
__label__noemo	It will be held at the Central Music Hall .
__label__noemo	Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
__label__noemo	No , I'm fine . Thank you .
__label__noemo	Ok ... I ’ ll talk to you later . Bye
__label__noemo	This is Nicola Grey , and this is Claire Taylor .
__label__noemo	Have you updated your CV ?
__label__noemo	How do you want to send it ?
__label__noemo	No , why should I ? I don ’ t feel like it . Besides , I ’ m in such a bad mood .
__label__noemo	Can I make one right now ?
__label__noemo	Anything good for this evening ?
__label__noemo	Let ’ s see ... ' Wanted , manager for up-and-coming firm . Must have good organizational skills . Experience a plus . Please contact Betty Sue . ' Oh , I don ’ t know ...
__label__noemo	sure . My mom has been working on our family tree for years . She ’ s always updating it .
__label__noemo	It ’ s almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild .
__label__noemo	OK , Mom . Can I swim now ? I want to learn butterfly stroke .
__label__noemo	And a storm blew our roof away .
__label__noemo	All right , I'll adjust the price accordingly .
__label__noemo	How much will my pay be , if you don ’ t mind my asking ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I know , but she's dangerous .
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__noemo	Yes , I have been always learning the Economics on my own . My dream is to get a master's degree in Economics .
__label__noemo	My wife and I didn't used to spend this much money .
__label__joy	Just got back.Good to see you !
__label__fear	Jack , let ’ s go !
__label__noemo	I hear they have very nice stuff .
__label__noemo	Thank you for your compliments .
__label__joy	I woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day , but I was wrong . A twist of fate brought us together . I crashed into your life and you into mine , and this may sound crazy , but I ’ m falling in love with you , Veronica .
__label__noemo	Well , you can keep the vegetables , I ’ ll take the meat . The stir fry my wife made was really hearty , with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion ...
__label__noemo	Hey ! I'm the tour guide . I'll take care of the Taiwanese guests .
__label__noemo	What about next Monday ?
__label__noemo	What day is today ?
__label__noemo	Did you want to do something tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	You can say that again .
__label__noemo	The ones that are on sale are from Central America .
__label__noemo	Yes , here you are . Enjoy your meal .
__label__noemo	It slipped my mind .
__label__noemo	Not until the 31st . So can you change the church reservations ?
__label__noemo	No , I'm not sure .
__label__noemo	What ’ s your attitude when do wrong things at work ?
__label__noemo	Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ?
__label__joy	I ate so much that I wasn't hungry until afternoon the next day .
__label__noemo	Thank you very much .
__label__joy	Perfect . Are you prepared to give me all your money ?
__label__joy	I'd like to .
__label__noemo	Umm ... no ... I make these in my workshop in the North Pole !
__label__noemo	OK . Here's your ticket .
__label__noemo	You ’ re a part of history .
__label__noemo	How about languages ?
__label__noemo	What colour is her hair ?
__label__noemo	What did he say ?
__label__noemo	Do you know that song ?
__label__noemo	I know . But this year I want to get him an interesting tie . Like this one .
__label__noemo	Good afternoon , sir . Welcome to our hotel.What kind of room would you like , sir ?
__label__noemo	You are a good wife , Julia . But you must take care of yourself .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll get an electrician to repair it as soon as possible . Is that everything ?
__label__sadness	That ’ s too bad . I ’ m sorry to hear that .
__label__noemo	We have a team to make itineraries of the tour , evaluate the value of it for one tourist and recommend the routine for different tourists .
__label__noemo	Come on . Let's split the difference , 15 % .
__label__noemo	The salary will be deposited into the bank on the 15th every month . Your salary will be raised every year in October , depending on your performance evaluation.you can get a bonus once a year.and it's normally in December .
__label__noemo	Do you want to get something to eat later ?
__label__joy	I like NBA very much .
__label__noemo	yes , but is got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry .
__label__noemo	What's the trouble ?
__label__joy	That's a good idea . I haven't been in a while and I need to get a new backpack . The old one is hanging on by a thread !
__label__noemo	Working out is another good way to relieve anger .
__label__noemo	I thought it would be a good idea to get a check-up .
__label__noemo	Fine.How long does it take to get to 82nd Street ?
__label__noemo	What are you taking my blood for ?
__label__noemo	No , I assure you .
__label__sadness	I'm afraid I can't . Parking is not allowed here .
__label__noemo	Yes ?
__label__noemo	If I saw the stop sign , I would've stopped for it .
__label__joy	Just yesterday . I'm still getting used to it .
__label__noemo	Read me the index number !
__label__noemo	yes . I have so many clothes stuffed into it . Perhaps I should get rid of some of them . There are clothes in there that I never wear anymore .
__label__noemo	Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ’ t like your way .
__label__noemo	to begin with , I have to use chopsticks .
__label__noemo	no , but now he'll be in trouble . What's a boyfriend for ? To forget about Valentine's Day ?
__label__noemo	It must be difficult to remember the details for each individual client .
__label__noemo	He not only sent me nasty e-mail , but he's so bored , he even asked me to search the Net for even more forwards for him !
__label__noemo	How much was the ticket ?
__label__disgust	I hate to go outside .
__label__joy	Good news ! And congratulations !
__label__noemo	What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ?
__label__noemo	It's easier doing this kind hard work when I know that I trust the man behind the posters .
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Come on ! A little labor , much health .
__label__joy	Yes , but dinner was excellent
__label__noemo	You can also state his personality traits , hobbies and relationships with schoolmates and so on .
__label__noemo	In about 3 to 4 days .
__label__noemo	Yes it is . Think about it . If nobody paid any attention to anything then what's it all for anyway ?
__label__noemo	I need to open a US dollar account , trade with America is going up each year .
__label__noemo	5,000 Euros will be sufficient , thanks .
__label__noemo	Certainly , Madam . What would you like to know ?
__label__noemo	You sound relieved .
__label__noemo	Non-smoking , please .
__label__noemo	how's it going ?
__label__noemo	Han .
__label__noemo	We'll take great care .
__label__noemo	OK , sir . We will arrange one for you .
__label__noemo	Yes , I know . And next time I must make good preparations .
__label__noemo	That ’ s fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ?
__label__noemo	I see . Did you have anything specific in mind ?
__label__noemo	Hello ! How do I get online with my laptop ?
__label__noemo	I have a TEFL certificate .
__label__noemo	I appreciate the referral , doctor .
__label__noemo	Do you have any rooms available next Saturday and Sunday night ?
__label__noemo	John made out with other girls at the party yesterday .
__label__noemo	Um , yes , please , I could really use some help . I'm going over to my boss'house for dinner tonight and don't know what kind of wine I should bring .
__label__noemo	We are suppliers of the summer clothes of various styles and colors . I think you will be interested in some of our new products . We always keep the pace of the clothes fashion , so as to catch the interest of our customers .
__label__noemo	Have you tried this one ? It ’ s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . You can also download updates for free .
__label__noemo	We're only available at 3
__label__noemo	Come on , nothing can be that bad .
__label__noemo	Of course.Let me help you .
__label__noemo	I'd like to book two tickets for the film ' Jane Eyre ' for this evening , please .
__label__surprise	Really ? I ’ m surprised .
__label__noemo	Where do most of them come from ?
__label__noemo	Do you have any cars available ?
__label__joy	Great ! They're the very books I want.May I borrow two books ?
__label__noemo	Well , there's a bench under the tree . We can sit there .
__label__noemo	Our quality control department is in charge of the inspection , which is directly under general manager . It is essential to attach the importance to the quality of goods . It is the basement for the future cooperation .
__label__noemo	Yes , they all stop at this corner .
__label__noemo	It's hard for me to imagine . How can you stand that ?
__label__noemo	And do you know where the national bank is ?
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	It doesn ’ t matter how much .
__label__noemo	Because I would like to get a job in which I can have good opportunity for advancement , and the job was not challenging enough .
__label__noemo	On the rocks , please .
__label__joy	That ’ s great . How much is it ?
__label__noemo	This microwave stove has many functions . Let me show you . For example , if you want to cook meat , you just need to put meat in it , and press the button with a picture of meat , that ’ s OK . After several minutes , you can eat the delicious meat .
__label__noemo	A double room sounds great .
__label__noemo	Yeah I got a club card . Here you go .
__label__sadness	Sorry , sir , we are having a sale now .
__label__noemo	I like to do just about anything outdoors . Do you enjoy camping ?
__label__noemo	See you later !
__label__noemo	Good afternoon madam . What can I do for you ?
__label__joy	Let's hope it's the beginning of a long and prosperous relationship .
__label__noemo	In ten dollar bill , please .
__label__noemo	But I won't let you do that . I will watch you .
__label__noemo	Plenty . We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
__label__noemo	Ok , but how long I have to wait , it is going to be more than 30 minutes .
__label__noemo	My wallet , with $ 200 in it , my wrist watch.some of my wife's jewellery from our bedroom , and a silver photoframe .
__label__noemo	Why did you choose to attend that college ?
__label__noemo	You know , some grape juice would be really nice , too .
__label__noemo	Yes , I think so .
__label__noemo	How do we get to the library from here ?
__label__noemo	That sounds perfect . Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me Mr . Parsons .
__label__joy	Yes.Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	well , Jerry , let me tell you a secret .
__label__surprise	Are you serious ?
__label__joy	Take-out , please .
__label__noemo	She's going to kill you .
__label__surprise	He's in the third grade Sam ! You see under each subject that he is being taught in school , he receives a mark from one to three . A one means his achievement or work is excellent . Here in Science for example he got a two , which means its satisfactory .
__label__noemo	No , but I ’ m planning on visiting Australia and new Zealand soon . I ’ Ve heard that they are beautiful countries . Which is the most beautiful country you ’ Ve been to ?
__label__noemo	Yes , please .
__label__joy	Very well , thank you .
__label__noemo	I have a problem with this check .
__label__joy	Please go to receive optometry first over there .
__label__noemo	Weigh ? It must be a greatest Chinese invention . I've tried hard to learn it . Its rules can't be any simpler , but I've never won a game of Go . Well , it's all Greek to me !
__label__noemo	How much is it ?
__label__noemo	You've got no guts !
__label__noemo	White ? What make do you want ? Arid what size ?
__label__noemo	But I exercise at the club . And I use the stepping machine.So I need good running shoes .
__label__noemo	What did you argue about ?
__label__noemo	Oh , it's highly efficient .
__label__surprise	What ? You've got to be kidding me !
__label__noemo	But we can't have thirteen for dinner !
__label__noemo	Is there an alarm system in the apartment ?
__label__noemo	Can you tell me how long your internet has been messing up ?
__label__noemo	Bad . My nose keeps running . And my forehead is burning .
__label__noemo	When did you begin to learn English ?
__label__noemo	In tens and fifties , please .
__label__noemo	I am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year , what do you say ?
__label__noemo	So I'd rather walk or run to work .
__label__sadness	I ’ m very sorry .
__label__noemo	Things couldn't be better.Where are you going now ?
__label__noemo	No , the one next to it .
__label__noemo	What am I suppose to do ?
__label__noemo	Do you have any hobbies ? What is it or what are they ?
__label__noemo	Sixty dollars .
__label__noemo	Would you please fill out this currency declaration form ? It's a record of the foreign currency you have brought in .
__label__noemo	Can I get the ticket here ?
__label__noemo	I see . And what's in this bag ?
__label__noemo	It depends where you live , sir .
__label__noemo	O . K . , so it ’ s this one ?
__label__noemo	Did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked ?
__label__noemo	I can't help it .
__label__joy	That's great . Let's go skating together tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Hold the line , please . ( ... ) All right . Your seat is confirmed , Mr . Adams . You'll be arriving in Buenos Aires at 4 o'clock p . m . local time .
__label__noemo	And now ?
__label__joy	Yeah . That can be a good hobby .
__label__surprise	That was before he heard Stanley sing ! I guess he couldn't stand it any more , so he decided to give it a try himself !
__label__sadness	Sorry . You can only pay in cash .
__label__noemo	No problem . Your room numbers are 201 and 204 .
__label__noemo	What do you think of this coffee table ?
__label__fear	Well , I just saw a horror movie last night . It almost frightened me to death .
__label__noemo	You mean used car ?
__label__noemo	Hey , May , look , Is that the the poster of the movie we saw yesterday ?
__label__joy	A funny thing happened to me the other day .
__label__noemo	Ar , Yes . There ’ s a big cavity .
__label__noemo	No , I have not .
__label__noemo	Yes , I do . I like traveling very much .
__label__noemo	Is that better ?
__label__noemo	I am sure we will .
__label__noemo	Mm , yeah , who can you see on the bus ? Can you pick out anyone on the bus who looks interesting ?
__label__noemo	Reservation , please .
__label__noemo	Hello , IBA Bank , how can I help you ?
__label__noemo	What is this for ?
__label__noemo	We can also look at your current credit status and adjust the interest accordingly .
__label__surprise	Really ? Do you like it ?
__label__noemo	She . She seems to be doing a pretty good job . Of course , anything would be better than that last guy !
__label__noemo	By the way , do you know the price of the gas now ?
__label__surprise	You are kidding , but she's so helpful .
__label__noemo	That sucks so much . What are we going to do ?
__label__noemo	I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it .
__label__noemo	With ice , sir ?
__label__noemo	That's probably Anne Wallis .
__label__noemo	How about this one ? It's our biggest — 16 ” in diameter .
__label__noemo	It's quite cold this early morning , isn't it ?
__label__noemo	Mr . Chandler will be our new partner , so his visit this time will be extremely important for our cooperation in future , because it may decide whether Mr . Chandler sign the trade contract with us or not . Do you have some idea ?
__label__noemo	Could you tell me about your professional education ?
__label__noemo	I'll put your drink order in and be right back to get your dinner order .
__label__noemo	I ’ m Rose Teller . I think I ’ Ve seen you somewhere before ?
__label__noemo	Why are you interested in working with this company ?
__label__noemo	150 pounds .
__label__noemo	It's all right . Kids are like that .
__label__noemo	I didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel . What ’ s the main storyline ?
__label__noemo	Good point . This is Sarah O ’ Connell reporting live from Washington D . C . , back to you , Tom .
__label__noemo	Actually , my office is right around the corner .
__label__noemo	Do you think it will help ?
__label__noemo	I know of a place you'll like and you have got to be there .
__label__joy	When you finish completing the request form , we will order and let you know when the supplies are here . Have a great day !
__label__joy	You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying , you are a super negotiator .
__label__noemo	I've never gotten one . Have you ?
__label__noemo	I don't like this kind as much . Never mind the stopwatch then . I'll take that other one . Do you take checks ?
__label__noemo	Good morning . Could you tell me where I can find the Clothing Department ?
__label__noemo	You mean it shuts off to save energy ?
__label__noemo	Well , how do I look in this one ?
__label__noemo	Anything else ?
__label__noemo	The boy threw up .
__label__noemo	Didn't they announce that our flight was delayed ?
__label__noemo	Just 6 digits .
__label__joy	It will give rise to occasional insomnia . OK , let's enjoy the tea before it gets cold .
__label__joy	I am 100 % certain .
__label__noemo	So the guest is presumed to be thirsty and in need of some drink after the trip . In that case , I guess , in return , the guest doesn't have to drink it if he wouldn't like it .
__label__noemo	You have to buy a ticket first . You want to go to Shi Da , right ?
__label__sadness	I didn't think of it.Thank you.And I do apologize for being late .
__label__noemo	No , I ’ m not sure I ’ m going to .
__label__noemo	Come on . What do you want to do ? Washing clothes or cleaning the house ?
__label__joy	the dinner was really good . It knocked my socks off .
__label__noemo	There ’ s some paperwork , but most of the time we put any information onto computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ?
__label__noemo	Your dream comes true now .
__label__noemo	My wife is really a chatter box . It ’ s so boring .
__label__noemo	I haven't seen her yet .
__label__noemo	What would you like to drink ?
__label__noemo	Er ... double with bath . I'd appreciate it if you could give me a room with a view over the lake .
__label__noemo	Yes , you may enjoy a seven-day holiday in the first year . After that , you can have two more days each year .
__label__noemo	I see.OK , that's agreed then .

__label__noemo	I enjoy Rock and R & B .
__label__noemo	That ’ s it , my lease is up . I have to move .
__label__noemo	I was thinking about taking tennis lessons . I always have an hour to spare in the afternoon . What do you think about that ?
__label__joy	That sounds fantastic ! But I am looking for something closer to the downtown , as I spend most of my time at the office .
__label__joy	Thank you very much .

__label__anger	Me too , it's so unreliable .
__label__noemo	Well , I hope you ’ ll feel better soon .
__label__noemo	Surely not . I can feel the results . I'm starting to feel different now .

__label__noemo	Would you like me to leave the samples with you ?
__label__noemo	I would like to come in on Tuesday .
__label__noemo	Check out the flyer with all of the home ’ s information on it .
__label__noemo	Of course I won't chill out . Opportunity knocks only once .
__label__noemo	3,075 . Our paychecks are 3300 combined . That means we don't have any receipts for 225 .
__label__noemo	All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission .
__label__noemo	Is it formal or informal ?

__label__noemo	What should be put in my education background ?
__label__noemo	Here's the money.And get some salt .
__label__noemo	I see . And how about the working hours ?
__label__noemo	Hold the line , please.Mr Wood is in the meeting with managing director at the moment I afraid.Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Absolutely . To be frank , I learned quite a lot about those animals and polar areas . I'm thinking of my kids there one of these days .
__label__noemo	Where do they grow mangoes ?
__label__noemo	Our 10th wedding anniversary ?
__label__noemo	Evan , are you busy right now ?
__label__noemo	There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality . Is it going to be some future project that never happens ?
__label__joy	certainly , i love waltz very much .
__label__joy	I ’ m going to the beauty parlor . Do you want to come too ?
__label__joy	It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is .
__label__joy	Yes , I did .
__label__noemo	Oh , I must have been sitting in the same position too long . My legs have fallen asleep .
__label__noemo	You're Mary , right ?
__label__noemo	Yes . It ’ s on this street . Keep walking for two blocks and it ’ s on the corner on the right .
__label__noemo	I guess I'll send it by airmail .
__label__noemo	Good . I'll take it right now , if possible .
__label__noemo	I'm from Madras .
__label__noemo	Why are you celebrating this festival ?
__label__noemo	You are welcome .
__label__noemo	I don't want you to leave until you clean up .
__label__noemo	More than five years now . After I did my engineering degree , I began to specialize in computer technology and I even had my own company for a while .
__label__noemo	I can't finish this steak .
__label__noemo	how time flies . But hey , how are things going with you ?
__label__noemo	The portions here are man sized . We usually end up taking half of the meal home with us .
__label__noemo	I hope it ’ ll continue for a long time .
__label__noemo	Not too rare .
__label__disgust	Ugh . Another advertisement . They ’ Ve added two hours of advertisements to a two hours movie .
__label__noemo	Ah , ah , you promised , and remember ?
__label__sadness	I am sorry . Mr . Doff is out right now .
__label__noemo	All right , thank you !
__label__noemo	All I get is a black screen .
__label__noemo	What is the price of the suite ?
__label__noemo	Ok . Does he know your number ?
__label__noemo	I actually have a class right around there .

__label__noemo	Why do I need an appointment ?
__label__joy	A pleasure meeting you as well , the flowers are for you .
__label__noemo	I will contact the sellers with your current offer .
__label__surprise	You've got a beautiful singing voice !
__label__noemo	We can do an allergy test , and later I can send you for an asthma test .
__label__noemo	Do you say prayers before dinner ?
__label__joy	Thank you so much . I'll try and catch that .
__label__noemo	Is there anything else I can help you with ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me , are you Miss Green ?
__label__noemo	If they all unite on a certain issue , it's the stockholders who have the final say . You'd think it might be our CEO or the workers , but in fact , the stockholders control the money so they have the most power .
__label__noemo	If it were up to Stanley , we'd have the wedding in the ETV ! He loves to sing .
__label__noemo	What about ' Farewell My Concubine ' ? I've been wanting to see it for a long time .
__label__joy	That ’ s good to hear .
__label__noemo	It is . But there is no Frans Smith here . Do you know which department he works in ?
__label__noemo	Yes , please . That would be a great help . Are you sure you don ’ t mind ?
__label__noemo	My brother joined the army last year .
__label__noemo	Is anti-virus software necessary for a PC ?
__label__noemo	Yes . You are free to do temporary business with this visa . If you were planning on setting up a new business in the U . S . you might need to apply for a long-term visa .
__label__noemo	No , I encourage her to go her own way , but she's now having a change of heart .
__label__disgust	Oooo ... gross ... you're sweating all over the place .
__label__joy	Yes , we can do that . Can we borrow the chairs from the lunchroom also ?
__label__noemo	Tell me how far to go .
__label__joy	Oh , thank you . I want one .
__label__joy	I think that is really cool of you .
__label__noemo	Certainly , sir . What kind of flowers would you like ?
__label__noemo	When did you start it ?
__label__noemo	Your intention is good , but I still can't agree with you . If no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself .
__label__noemo	What's wrong ?
__label__noemo	this is Nathaniel Brown .
__label__noemo	What if I need a roommate ?
__label__noemo	He's got a promotion .
__label__noemo	How about going to italy next summer vacation ?
__label__anger	You've just scratched my car . Oh , God , a paint was scratched off .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t understand , I made a reservation , do you have my reservation ?
__label__noemo	Of course . The warranty period is one year .
__label__noemo	Well , what's the climate like in your country ?
__label__noemo	You are right . But what if the avalanche happened ?
__label__noemo	I didn ’ t mean to hurt anyone .
__label__noemo	How many days shall we spend on the trip ?
__label__noemo	Very quiet and safe . And it's got a lot of trees and plants .
__label__noemo	I am putting a tourniquet on your arm to plump up the vein . It will only feel like a little pin prick .
__label__noemo	Can you give me a hand with my luggage ?
__label__joy	I enjoy the various characters and the plot .
__label__noemo	Once in a while .
__label__noemo	That's just your personal prejudice . Do you know who was the director of the movie Titanic ?
__label__noemo	I hope you can try to get them to step up production .
__label__noemo	Before your main course , would you like to order an appetizer ?
__label__noemo	Go right ahead .
__label__noemo	So what did you think about the movie ?
__label__noemo	My present address is No . 21 South Zhongshan Road , Apt . 19 , Shanghai . The post code is 220150 .
__label__noemo	My name is Paul .
__label__noemo	Yeah , you need to take advantage of it within its expiry date .
__label__noemo	I can ’ t wait to retire .
__label__noemo	I want to deposit cash .
__label__noemo	Did you have anything particular in mind ?
__label__noemo	I hope you feel better .
__label__noemo	I have studied English , tourist culture , guiding methods and techniques and so on .
__label__noemo	No .
__label__anger	His face broke out and he said it was my fault !
__label__joy	You mean the one starring John Travolta ?
__label__joy	How long have you lived here ?
__label__noemo	Hello . I've been told to come in and see someone about my L / C . I just had a message to come in and see someone called Kristy .
__label__noemo	No , before the In dynasty .
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	You ’ re leaving so soon . When are you off ?
__label__noemo	What's the date today Mr.Brown ? I don't have a calendar .
__label__noemo	What time does the 7 fifty-nine get to London ?
__label__joy	Well , I came to know a girl three weeks ago . We have so much in common .
__label__noemo	How long have we had the A3 printer in the sales department ?
__label__noemo	I mean beautiful and heartfelt-something that will make her cry .
__label__noemo	No , this is her sister , Nancy .
__label__noemo	Where do you want to go ?
__label__noemo	Why not ? You've done so well for the company . She should give you a prize .
__label__noemo	The May holiday is coming up soon . Are you planning on going on vacation ?
__label__noemo	why ? I think cats are ok .
__label__joy	What's more , she doesn't have scandals . And she likes to take part in the charitable activities .
__label__noemo	I'll see you at the airport at 12:30 P . m .
__label__noemo	We've prepared name cards to be put on the conference table for guests to sit by . What time would you like refreshments served , Mr . Miller ?
__label__noemo	Well , let ’ s have a look . Open wide . Hmm ... this doesn ’ t look good . Well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . We ’ ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse , and the crown probably needs to be refitted . I ’ m going to order some x-rays .
__label__noemo	Let ’ s think this through . First of all , you cannot leave Amy at the altar . Not only will she be humiliated and kill you , but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? Second of all , you are just getting cold feet . You know deep down inside that you want to marry her , so cut the crap and do it !
__label__noemo	Help me organize these coins .
__label__noemo	Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ?
__label__noemo	Donna ! How are you ? It's good to hear your voice .
__label__joy	Cheers ! Let ’ s tie one on .
__label__joy	All right , thank you so much , good-bye .
__label__noemo	I studied English in junior and senior high school . And in college , I took English conversation lessons . They were given by foreign tutors .
__label__joy	Oh . What good is that ? I thought it gave you free money .
__label__noemo	I actually transferred here from another school .
__label__noemo	Oh , look at those earrings , Maria . They're perfect for you .
__label__noemo	From 11 thirty to 1 o ’ clock .
__label__noemo	How about stewed-fried steamed pork ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it sure is . I had to run here from work ! I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break .
__label__noemo	They managed a 99:80 victory .
__label__noemo	I ’ m asking about overdraft fees .
__label__noemo	It belongs to the past . He lost his job the other day , and he ’ s up a tree now .
__label__sadness	I know you don't hear me right know , please calm down . Anyway , I don't wanna part . I'll drop by tomorrow .
__label__noemo	Certainly . Ok , got you .
__label__noemo	Okay , I'll make you some food .
__label__joy	Thank you , Mr . White . I really appreciate your assistance .
__label__noemo	What do you eat ?
__label__noemo	""" The final costing , including advert design and production , comes to forty-five thousand six hundred RIB . We want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . Thanks for ... """
__label__noemo	I go to bed , but I just can ’ t get comfortable enough to stay asleep .
__label__noemo	Yes , I'd like to see the manager.Here ' s my card .
__label__surprise	Well , this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up , half his face had been bitten off !
__label__joy	0h , that would be nice of you .
__label__noemo	Oh , about two years now .
__label__noemo	What didn't you like about it ?
__label__noemo	Sure , we'll take 20 % off the price .
__label__noemo	OK.She ' s near-sighted , with a pair of glasses on her nose.She is the only one wearing glasses in my family .
__label__noemo	By crunching the numbers and putting in your expenses , I estimate that you can afford a house of around five hundred thousand dollars .
__label__noemo	Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager .
__label__noemo	Very well . I hope you ' ll enjoy your stay in America .
__label__joy	Thanks !
__label__joy	Welcome home , Peter !
__label__noemo	Where is it located ?
__label__noemo	Hm ... the smell is too strong , I can't stand it . I'm very sensitive to fragrance .
__label__joy	That's right
__label__noemo	Sure , what's happened ?
__label__joy	Quite well , thank you .
__label__joy	That's fantastic .
__label__joy	It will be the best as long as the weatherman is right .
__label__noemo	I wonder whether I could possibly borrow your new bicycle now .
__label__noemo	Maybe you are right . But the major is not fit for me . I like architecture more than computers .
__label__noemo	Yeah , this is the latest model.If you like it , you can try it on .
__label__noemo	You can make it by the No . 913 bus , or by subway Line 13 .
__label__noemo	Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others .
__label__noemo	I am supposed to go to Liu Ichang .
__label__noemo	I remember you said that you like China because it has cheap beers .
__label__noemo	Hello everyone ! I ’ m Rick Fields , and here with me is Bob Copeland .
__label__noemo	How did your interview go ?
__label__noemo	I have the same idea as you .
__label__surprise	Only $ 2,000 ? Are there any other ways to get the money exchanged ?
__label__noemo	Here is my receipt .
__label__noemo	I have been washing clothes here since a few years ago .
__label__noemo	Would you like me to try another card ?
__label__noemo	Not bad . The fur market is not very brisk lately , but the selling season is advancing near . I hope there will be more buyers in the market this year .
__label__joy	Bye .
__label__noemo	How many bids had been placed before you ?
__label__joy	I'm more than happy having her in my class .
__label__noemo	You can either list your job experience next or your education--whichever is the most impressive should be first .
__label__noemo	I don't like being too tired the next day .
__label__noemo	Fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . What do you think about 20 % this time ?
__label__noemo	Will it take me straight there ?
__label__noemo	We'll miss you while you're studying in the United States .
__label__noemo	That ’ s what I understand .
__label__noemo	I love being photographed ! If I were famous , I ’ d do interviews for all the top magazines , like cosmo and elle .
__label__noemo	I see . It's a problem most of us face . May I ask what the purchase price is ?
__label__noemo	I've heard The Hitchhiker would be on next week . I want to see it .
__label__noemo	What do you plan to do on Sunday morning ?
__label__noemo	Don ’ t you see many parents are forcing there children ’ s hands to learn something they think important to their children . But the children are not interested in it at all .
__label__noemo	Will that be first class or economy seat ?
__label__noemo	The only thing is that my pen friend will be writing in English .
__label__noemo	When did you change your mind ?
__label__noemo	What happened to you ?
__label__noemo	This house is not looking all that great from here
__label__noemo	When are you going to take your vacation ?
__label__noemo	Does that include hotels and meals ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	I am in charge of marketing activities in South-East Asia , for example , organizing trade conferences and arranging exhibitions .
__label__noemo	My sister did it . When did you get yours cut ?
__label__joy	The early bird catches the worm .
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	Good morning , sir . I ’ Ve got breakfast your ordered .
__label__noemo	$ 10 .
__label__noemo	oh , Tibet sounds great , but I'm afraid it'll cost too much . Last time I traveled to India , and it cost me a fortune .
__label__joy	OK.Thank you very much for your trouble .
__label__joy	So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea !
__label__noemo	Lili , let ’ s take a vacation !
__label__noemo	When will you be back ?
__label__noemo	I myself like very much to listen to the singing of some of the insects , especially the singing of cicadas .
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__noemo	Not at all . The feedback from audience has been great . I care about what they think more than what the critics think .
__label__noemo	It depends on the weather .
__label__joy	You're right . Thank you for your cooperation .
__label__noemo	Could you drive me to the bank ?
__label__joy	Oh ! Hey , look , that's the same shirt Britney wore in her concert .
__label__noemo	Fine , thank you . And you ?
__label__noemo	Where are you going for your trip ?
__label__joy	I feel so good . That warm hot pot certainly hits the spot on winter nights .
__label__noemo	It's flight CA169 , which leaves Beijing at 8: 00 a . m . on January 20th .
__label__joy	Yes , that was one fantastic meal !
__label__noemo	It's a little bit tight .
__label__joy	I like to play the piano for fun .
__label__noemo	Do you think it's time to sign the contract , Mr . Simpson ?
__label__noemo	Though they were ugly , they had great virtue .
__label__noemo	I was wondering , I have heard many of my co-wokers that your knowledge and experience in international markets is phenomenal . Also , I ’ Ve heard the rumor that you speak fluent Japanese . Is that right ?
__label__noemo	I might make nothing even if I stay . For that kind of risk , I want to get rich .
__label__noemo	I am kind of busy right now , but maybe later next week I could stop by .
__label__noemo	Your name , please ?
__label__joy	I'm going to have my first baby , so I plan to hold a baby shower next Sunday .
__label__noemo	Why did you transfer ?
__label__joy	How much longer is it going to be ?
__label__noemo	All right .
__label__noemo	nice to meet you too .
__label__noemo	Here you go .
__label__noemo	Vince , I think one of your programmers is spying on us for WebTracker .
__label__noemo	Ok , when and where did you last see it ?
__label__noemo	I hear you and James are engaged at last .
__label__noemo	Furnished .
__label__noemo	I'd like to buy a new mobile phone please .
__label__noemo	Of course , sir ... Here's the minutes of the meeting .
__label__anger	Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .
__label__noemo	Which fees ?
__label__noemo	I have my passport with me , a driver ’ s license and a membership card . Will they do ?
__label__noemo	Wow , it is like a maze , I think I might get lost soon .
__label__noemo	So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .
__label__noemo	I know , but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left .
__label__joy	I'll be yours through endless time .
__label__noemo	That is ok , then ? Starts on the cheek ? pretty soon you french kiss in the back on his car .
__label__noemo	I'll call you in a day or two , did you write down your phone number on your resume ?
__label__noemo	Let me guess , from Sarah . It looks like something she would drive .
__label__noemo	What kind of movie is it ?
__label__joy	I have to say you're a well-matched couple .
__label__joy	No.thanks . I'm full .
__label__noemo	Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot . Did you not sleep well ?
__label__noemo	To be on the safe side , and for garment of all materials , sizes , and styles , I think the amount will be 50,000 pieces a year .
__label__noemo	What's the regular price ?
__label__noemo	We are in the same math class . Our teacher sat us next to each other .
__label__noemo	That means our local TV station is showing old episodes . You can watch reruns of nearly every old sitcom .
__label__noemo	I won't , mum .
__label__noemo	I think you have a point .
__label__noemo	ASAP , in writing of course .
__label__joy	My pleasure .
__label__noemo	Silly , you should make sure he does .
__label__noemo	Are you crazy ? Tomorrow's Saturday .
__label__noemo	We did a survey on your job performance .
__label__joy	That ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . I ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew.Oh , they look so cute !
__label__noemo	I'm searching for an old music box .
__label__noemo	Yes , It's John eng .
__label__joy	Yes , it is nice , but wait until you see the interior .
__label__joy	Maybe you can come to the bar one day and I ’ ll show you around .
__label__noemo	How much are you willing to pay ?
__label__noemo	Sorry , I'm engaged for the foxtrot.Will the next Walls be all right ?
__label__noemo	No , that's fine . Do you bring your bankbook with you ?
__label__noemo	I see . Is there a bus I can take ?
__label__noemo	It's about thirty minutes long .
__label__joy	I'm serious .
__label__noemo	Don't you see I'm trying my best ?
__label__noemo	I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .
__label__noemo	I do ?
__label__noemo	Nice meeting you , too .
__label__joy	That's what I want ! Do you need me to sign anything ? Or fill in some forms ?
__label__noemo	"They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's "" chi "" ."
__label__sadness	Oh , this is terrible , Yuri . Terrible ! So we can't even assess the damages . How can we do business in this country ? Either we're buried under mud , or we're in danger of getting kidnapped.No , I can't believe this mess !
__label__noemo	Just what ? Stop beating around the bush . Tell me what you want to know .
__label__joy	Thank you . I will .
__label__noemo	Well , what kind of books does she like ?
__label__noemo	You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that . No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen . The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away .
__label__noemo	No , I'm not . I'm going to look for an apartment .
__label__noemo	Where have you been ?
__label__noemo	Hey , let ’ s go to the night market after work tonight .
__label__noemo	You would be using a lot of English in this job . Can you manage English conversation ?
__label__noemo	That's good ! I've also heard there will be a party held by the Students ' Union tomorrow evening . Would you like to go with me tomorrow night ?
__label__noemo	Not a problem , Sir . Please fill in this exchange form and show me your passport .
__label__joy	Thank you ! I always tune to this program when driving . So what's your favorite program ?
__label__noemo	He wants to go over the bonuses for this year . He ’ ll need to meet with Mr . Winthrop and Ms . Montgomery . Can you set it up for me ?
__label__noemo	that sounds really interesting . Can you speak Swahili ?
__label__noemo	Oh , it was great . We had seafood buffet . They do one every Friday . The waiters and waitresses are very good . They are very attentive , but don ’ t hang around the table .
__label__surprise	Science ? That's a surprise .
__label__noemo	For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn ’ t ever have to share .
__label__noemo	Your secretary seems to think she is being harassed .
__label__anger	Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house .
__label__noemo	Match is important ; well , the way of tying is also important .
__label__noemo	Of course
__label__noemo	May I ask your telephone number ?
__label__joy	Look ! David gives his following-comment on my first blog . He is my first visitor .
__label__noemo	OK , I'll do it right now .
__label__noemo	Aw , Mom . I don't want fruit , Aren't there any chocolate chips ?
__label__noemo	I heard that you went to the concert the day before ? How did you like it ?
__label__noemo	Do you have a foreign tour ?
__label__noemo	What are your plans ?
__label__noemo	So , I can have five for five dollars ?
__label__noemo	How about I come and see you off ?
__label__noemo	Ok , could you tell me your room number and your name ?
__label__noemo	Would you prefer first class or economy class ?
__label__noemo	I would rather deal with the winter than the summer .
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__noemo	Dreadful . There , the door is open now .
__label__noemo	Where do you work ?
__label__noemo	Maybe with the choice of life or death before you , you will find it easier .
__label__noemo	How much is the cable ?
__label__noemo	When could I take care of him ?
__label__noemo	But you know it's hard for a new graduate to find a god job right now .
__label__noemo	about 7:30 .
__label__noemo	Yes , I like using chopsticks .
__label__noemo	Can you recommend a resort to me ?
__label__noemo	I usually enjoy the meals here , so I think that we should tell the waiter that there is something wrong with this meal .
__label__joy	Thanks.Miss Zhang .
__label__fear	You are scaring me !
__label__noemo	Are you more a follower or a leader ?
__label__joy	That's wonderful ! We've got to celebrate !
__label__noemo	Put it in the waste-paper basket , please .
__label__noemo	Well , you see I can't find the key and I'm in a hurry . Come on , Fred , We're wasting time .
__label__noemo	Oh ? I heard she dumped you . Anyway , she's right over there . Oh , Sheryl !
__label__noemo	Sure . It ’ s not very heavy .
__label__noemo	This is the house I want to rent .
__label__noemo	No . you can cut quite a bit off , I like it to be very short all over . You see what I mean .
__label__noemo	What's on tonight ?
__label__joy	Sure that sounds great ! Are there any other fees ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry sir . The 250 - dollar rate is based on double occupancy . That means it ’ s 250 per person . The room itself is 500 dollars a night .
__label__noemo	Do you believe in god ?
__label__anger	It's your fault for mixing the two broths !
__label__noemo	Today ’ s interview is for us to get to know a little about you . And the interview will last a little bit longer . So , if you ’ re comfortable , I want to ask you some questions .
__label__joy	Yes . How about donating some money ?
__label__noemo	I think so .
__label__noemo	Six months . That's a long time .
__label__noemo	Have you heard about John ’ s obscene words towards the manager ?
__label__surprise	What do you mean ? You didn't ? Oh , no ... No !
__label__noemo	I've considered that . I'll share an apartment with others to save the rent , and the cost of living won't be too much for only one person .
__label__joy	This is such a beautiful day ! Great for sailing !
__label__noemo	Looking at the beautiful creatures and listening to their songs are such wonderful experiences . I feel as if I'm in direct contact with nature .
__label__joy	A DENY shirt and one of Serena Williams ' used tennis rackets !
__label__noemo	The best would be you have a smile on your face in the interview to win a good impression of the interviewer .
__label__noemo	Well , it's known that the Sino-American relation is in a dilemma . Does it influence your business in China ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry to hear that .
__label__noemo	I am also wondering about the pay .
__label__noemo	Yes . I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off .
__label__noemo	Is this the right counter to check in for this flight ?
__label__noemo	You know , Mary , I feel we meet somewhere before . Where were you born ?
__label__noemo	It's $ 4.25 cents by the glass . The whole bottle is $ 22.5 .
__label__surprise	Really ? That's wonderful . Can you wait a second ? I need to change .
__label__noemo	Aunt Shirley , I heard the Yuan Miao Festival is the name for the festival . Why did it get its name ?
__label__noemo	We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies .
__label__joy	Yes , it looks interesting .
__label__noemo	No . Never .
__label__noemo	About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world .
__label__noemo	Sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality .
__label__noemo	Hello , May I help you ?
__label__noemo	About two hours out of Los Angeles . Give me the bags , I'll put'em on the bus . Here's your claim tag . Don't lose it.When you get off the bus , give it to me .
__label__noemo	I wish I could find one just like it .
__label__joy	I'm glad you appreciate our folk music . But a live performance is much more interesting .
__label__noemo	Here is your working place . Nancy will come to show you how to set up the telephones . I'm going to call her now so that you can get started . Is that OK ?
__label__noemo	Alright , Ma'am . And what color did you want ?
__label__noemo	That dress looks lovely on you , but it's not very practical , is it ?
__label__noemo	Then he is really lucky .
__label__noemo	Hey , Taxi . Over here !
__label__joy	Of course . I made apple pie this morning , so it ’ s lovely and fresh .
__label__noemo	she's pretty easy to get along with . She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally .
__label__noemo	Please show me your receipt again .
__label__noemo	We are playing against Hainan .
__label__noemo	If possible , I'd like to be positioned in the International Trade Department .
__label__noemo	May I help you , sir ?
__label__joy	He's after your own heart , it is important .
__label__noemo	It's under the table .
__label__noemo	Have you decided what wine you would like ?
__label__noemo	Well , how much are they ?
__label__joy	Yes , that is me . Nice to meet you , Monica . Welcome on board !
__label__noemo	Mr . Thomas is quite busy , I ’ m afraid he won ’ t be able to see you today .
__label__noemo	Would you like to order now , madam ?
__label__noemo	I know some junior high kids who can stay out later than that .
__label__noemo	I am sorry , sir.We will send our staff right now .
__label__joy	It sounds nice , but don't forget this is a seedy , run-down neighborhood .
__label__noemo	Where should I sit ?
__label__sadness	I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another . Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . How could I do such a thing ?
__label__noemo	All right.Shall I enter all my belongings ?
__label__surprise	You're kidding ! Something as simple as that ?
__label__joy	Woo . It has such a long history . I think I should take more photos of the university .
__label__noemo	About a year ago , he started feeling weak all the time .
__label__noemo	if you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese ?
__label__noemo	I think one of the important things is just to be considerate of your co-workers'feelings and needs.If you are aware of other people and do your part to make a good working environment , you should be able to get along with most of the people you work with .
__label__noemo	of course I was scared . But I had an instructor that went with me and that helped .
__label__noemo	You get really passionate about this , don't you ? Alright . I'll watch it with you .
__label__noemo	Well , it ’ s a bit of a mixed bag in Utah today . we ’ Ve got heavy cloud cover here in Northern Utah , and we ’ re calling for scattered showers throughout the day , with a day-time high of forty-five degrees.Now , if we move down to the south of the state , we can see that a cold front is moving in.We can expect clear skies , but it will be quite cold , with temperatures hovering around the thirty degree mark .
__label__joy	Thanks . You'd be OK on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ?
__label__noemo	Try to avoid the possible duplicate answer if you can .
__label__noemo	What was the weather like yesterday ?
__label__noemo	It's hard to get tickets for the movie .
__label__noemo	Once in a while we have visitors from abroad and I would like to be able to ask my secretary to take them shopping and sightseeing .
__label__noemo	How do I get there on foot ?
__label__noemo	What are we doing ?
__label__noemo	I know . I can't tell whether he's serious or not so I need your advice .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot .
__label__noemo	This position demands a higher writing ability , so please say something about your writing ability .
__label__noemo	People can ’ t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , buy there ’ s more to do .
__label__noemo	Is it the one on Xi Shut Street ?
__label__noemo	I'm sorry to hear that . Anything I can do for you ?
__label__noemo	You are really confident .
__label__noemo	Could you point me in the direction of the bank ? I ’ Ve lost my way .
__label__noemo	My bad , I had chores to do .
__label__noemo	Will this be cash or charge ?
__label__noemo	Do you want me to make any other stops while I'm out ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	Goodbye .
__label__noemo	Yes , okay .
__label__noemo	I have one daughter and one son . Then there ’ s my husband and I . What about your parents ? Do they live with your family ?
__label__noemo	You ’ re lying .
__label__noemo	The poor girl is up to the eyes in study all the day .
__label__noemo	What ’ s the current interest rate ?
__label__noemo	Certainly , Miss Parker , Let me get my book . My secretary ’ s out and I can ’ t keep anything straight !
__label__noemo	Sorry to hear that , I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , I really enjoyed our last chat .
__label__noemo	You said it .
__label__noemo	Of course . They will be happy you asked about them .
__label__surprise	Moblogging ? what does that mean ?
__label__noemo	That's right , it really would be .
__label__noemo	The machines will turn on once you put the quarters into the slot .
__label__noemo	Wow ! It's hot today ! Do you want to get an ice cream cone ?
__label__noemo	Is that the university next to the Teachers ' College ?
__label__sadness	It ’ s still up in the air . There is something wrong between us .
__label__noemo	What's your price ?
__label__noemo	Where ?
__label__surprise	Oh , my god !
__label__joy	Good . Shall we say seven o'clock ?
__label__noemo	A moment , please .
__label__noemo	But it wasn ’ t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do .
__label__noemo	Yes.Bring me a bath towel as well .
__label__noemo	Where was your last job ?
__label__noemo	You can buy the bubble wrap here , but you ’ ll have to stand in line over here to post your package .
__label__joy	Look , it's starting !
__label__noemo	That's right . We are their sole PR sector business .
__label__surprise	Oh really what ’ s happening ?
__label__joy	That's great ! That was quick , after it not being there yesterday I wasn't expecting to hear from you for a while .
__label__noemo	I ’ m interested in all kinds of your products , but this time I would like to order some fireworks and mosquito coil incense . Please quote us C . I . F . Rangoon .
__label__joy	No , that ’ s perfect . We can leave directly from here .
__label__noemo	Me neither . All I have to do is study French hard .
__label__noemo	Would you like to come out with me tonight ?
__label__noemo	I guarantee you that our little “ friends ” won't be back . I hope your trip home is pleasant .
__label__noemo	Not really . But it has puzzled me for a long time .
__label__noemo	Could you tell me where the copier is , please ?
__label__noemo	Fine . I believe in Cindy's taste . Oh , what should I wear ?
__label__noemo	I have never been to the personnel market .
__label__noemo	Can you eat the stone ?
__label__noemo	No , I just watched Supergirl , and it began too late in the night . I was too excited to get asleep after one o'clock .
__label__joy	I appreciate the effort , sir .
__label__noemo	Yeah , it's the last world-wide horti-cultural exposition in the century , and one of the grand festivities of cross-century significance held by the China's tourism industry .
__label__noemo	Yes . Please help me reserve it .
__label__noemo	Will our company have some recreational activities ?
__label__noemo	OK . I'll blow .
__label__noemo	Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound .
__label__noemo	Is there anything I can do for you ?
__label__noemo	We agree to give you a break on the price , all together a discount of 6 % . Good news is , I talked to my boss , he confirmed that if you take care of the shipping costs , we'll throw in insurance .
__label__fear	It must be a haunted house . Are you frightened ?
__label__noemo	Hello , Can I speak to Tom , please ?
__label__surprise	What do you mean ? What happened ?
__label__noemo	I ’ m going to have to charge you for the damage .
__label__noemo	Five.My father , mother , brother , sister-in-law and me .
__label__noemo	It would take a lot less time ..
__label__noemo	Let me have it , please . I'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway .
__label__noemo	Do you know who Ammo Hung is ?
__label__joy	Things are so great here . I almost smiled myself to death last week . One of my coworkers had to give me CPR .
__label__joy	That's it ! That ’ s the one I was thinking of ! I told you I'd remember it !
__label__noemo	Me too . Did you play when you were a kid ?
__label__noemo	It doesn't cost anything ?
__label__noemo	But Joe won't you .
__label__noemo	Oh . I'm just going to take it easy .
__label__noemo	It's 600 yuan per month.The rent is due no later than the tenth of the month . We ask that you leave a month's rent as a deposit . It will be returned to you at the end of your lease .
__label__noemo	Well , it does have a lot of girls in it .
__label__noemo	You can count on it .
__label__noemo	I was laughing hysterically the whole time ; my stomach muscles hurt afterwards .
__label__noemo	Hello . Smith ’ s Resident .
__label__joy	How wonderful it is to be in love ! It's love at first sight ! Oh . he's my Romeo !
__label__noemo	Housekeeping , may I come in ?
__label__noemo	Do you have small bills ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me . Does this bus go by Tiananmen square ?
__label__noemo	that's amazing . I will install an online messenger program when I get home .
__label__joy	You are not going to believe this . Do you remember the dress we saw at Mayors that was so beautiful and expensive ? I got it today at half price .
__label__noemo	Do you know where I can find the application form ?
__label__joy	OK .
__label__noemo	And will I go up to the front to have the bread and wine ?
__label__noemo	Hopefully by tomorrow evening.Which hotel are you going to stay ?
__label__noemo	Well , actually I prefer something a bit bigger if that's possible .
__label__joy	I see . But I have to discuss it over with my boss before I make a decision .
__label__noemo	Sure . Our company is in Ericsson Tower , No . 12 Like East Street , Chaoyang District .
__label__noemo	We will inform you as soon as possible .
__label__noemo	She is now in a private school .
__label__noemo	No , it has three bedrooms and three beds , and has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling . There ’ s a two-car garage .
__label__noemo	Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ’ s always rush hour . So the buses are always crowded .
__label__noemo	Is she busy ?
__label__noemo	how about some mascara ? That will make her eyes look bigger .
__label__noemo	So what did you do ?
__label__noemo	I'd like a 20 - cent stamp , please .
__label__noemo	I would like high speed internet installed in my house .
__label__noemo	Ok , I will be there around 6 . Is that ok for you ?
__label__noemo	is everything alright ?
__label__surprise	really ? Why ?
__label__noemo	Did you see who the suspect was ?
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Alright . If you can bring it to me tomorrow morning , I can talk with you after class on Friday.So I'll have some feedback for you before the weekend .
__label__noemo	Are you ready to go the concert ?
__label__noemo	Why don't you phone her for a date again ?
__label__noemo	If you give us your inquiry , I shall go very carefully into the price and try my best to put you on the best of the terms .
__label__joy	She's going to be so pleased with this .
__label__noemo	So you have to open all the envelopes .
__label__noemo	Is 9:00 PM all right ?
__label__noemo	Now that it ’ s the new year , I ’ Ve decided to turn over a new leaf .
__label__noemo	What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	Well , I heard that naughty boys and girls get coal in their stockings , so I thought I'd be nice and make Santa cookies . I even left out some milk . I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies , so I came downstairs !
__label__noemo	A dark suit . White shirt . A tie . Why ?
__label__noemo	May I help you , sir ?
__label__joy	That's fine , thank you .
__label__noemo	Let me see . I think I can have the ensured five hundred dollars .
__label__noemo	You ?
__label__noemo	Oh , Diane and I went for a drive in the country on Saturday .
__label__noemo	I've noticed you've been munching away on lots of fruits and vegetables recently .
__label__noemo	I made strawberry shortcake .
__label__noemo	Well . It's not all my fault , Anna . You are responsible , too .
__label__noemo	I can't decide whether to go to university or to get a job .
__label__noemo	Yes , I have those .
__label__noemo	I proposed to my wife in your restaurant and I would like the same table if I can .
__label__noemo	Certainly , I can help you with that . Will that be the downtown or waterfront location ?
__label__noemo	Is the training center helpful ?
__label__noemo	Ok . Let me call you later . Is that okay ?
__label__noemo	No , your computer might have a virus , I mean , it has a bad program on it . Maybe that ’ s why it crashed . I recommend that you run an antivirus program in order to safely remove any unwanted spyware or Trojans .
__label__noemo	May I call you about our final decision ?
__label__noemo	I know that . I have seen the film as the same title . Andrews gives a performance to be remembered for a lifetime from Maria to a cheerful governess .
__label__noemo	If you bring some ID with you , it's possible for you to make a withdrawal over the counter if you need to . But unfortunately , without your new card you cannot use the ATM , so all withdrawals must be made within working hours .
__label__noemo	It ’ s all right . I don ’ t mind being busy !
__label__noemo	Yeah . Cold milk wakes me up .
__label__surprise	Lots ! Have you done any research about the company ?
__label__noemo	Hello , I'd like to talk to someone about making a withdrawal .
__label__noemo	Oh , I am sorry to hear that . Take it easy . It will be OK soon . You see , I take this long-hour plane frequently , but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
__label__noemo	Sorry , this biography is over the deadline . You should pay extra for it .
__label__noemo	Then the Engineering Manager will choose the candidate .
__label__noemo	Hop in , please .
__label__joy	Bye .
__label__noemo	No , not at all . I stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days .
__label__noemo	Oh ! I just drop in on him for a chat .
__label__noemo	Do you have a seat preference ?
__label__noemo	Alright . How many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
__label__noemo	Does it enjoy popularity among the young generation ?
__label__noemo	This suit looks nice.Can I try it on ?
__label__noemo	A vet's a man who takes care of sick animals . He's an animal doctor .
__label__noemo	I'll have to write you a ticket .
__label__noemo	Is there a vacant table for 2 right now ?
__label__noemo	we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning .
__label__noemo	As the saying goes , when in Rome , do as the Romans do .
__label__joy	That's perfect .
__label__noemo	I had a bad dream . I was walking alone in the graveyard , and suddenly all the ghosts jumped out of their graves . They began to chase me through the graveyard and shouted that they wanted my blood .
__label__noemo	Do you want me to show you where I found them ?
__label__anger	No , no ! Stupid machine , what are you doing ! No !
__label__joy	We ’ re in the last stretch of this very exciting race , and Kimmi Rikknen is leading the pack with only four laps to go ! They are heading to turn three and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Rikknen ! It ’ s a close one and , oh no ! Hamilton hits the wall !
__label__noemo	Why not ?
__label__noemo	Hello , this is John . I wanna speak to Linda , please .
__label__noemo	Hello , may I speak to Kevin , please ?
__label__noemo	My front window was busted .
__label__noemo	Yes , I have ACRE certificate , rank 2 .
__label__noemo	I've been so stressed these days .
__label__noemo	That ’ s an unlisted number . I ’ m sorry , but I can ’ t give it to you .
__label__noemo	What instructions ?
__label__noemo	Full-size , please . What's the rate ?
__label__noemo	Tom's dating your sister .
__label__noemo	I love sashimi . Did mom bring any soy sauce for that ?
__label__noemo	Hold on , with that wind , you ’ re going to catch a cold . Wear this scarf .
__label__noemo	Is it on this floor ?
__label__noemo	I think it's just a crush . You can't be serious .
__label__noemo	So , how was your trip to Thailand ?
__label__noemo	I mainly eat baked chicken , because there's not a lot of fat .
__label__noemo	Yes , you are right .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . Do you know where the Admiral Hotel is ?
__label__noemo	Miss , where do you want to go ?
__label__joy	No , thanks .
__label__noemo	So it's not as convenient for left-handed people ?
__label__joy	I can ’ t wait to start cooking ! I ’ Ve bought the grill and charcoal . Do you have enough plates and utensils ?
__label__noemo	You ’ re new here , right ?
__label__noemo	How would you like it ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I'm sorry , but there are a couple of different places I will travel to within the United States , so I wasn't sure what to put .
__label__noemo	Yes , let's go .
__label__noemo	Well , I think we'd better go now . We have to follow the guide .
__label__noemo	Oh , you may call him Uncle , or Henry .
__label__noemo	So what do you think of the American fast food culture ?
__label__noemo	Yes , Mother , but my arm is longer .
__label__noemo	Did you pass the test ?
__label__joy	Oh , good . Transfer , please .
__label__noemo	I can't deny that . She is so beautiful that I fell in love with her at the first sight . I wish I knew more about her .
__label__noemo	Oh , did you study a foreign language ?
__label__noemo	David , what have you been up to lately ?
__label__noemo	It ’ s a perfectly good school .
__label__noemo	I need to have a credit check done for my company .
__label__noemo	yeah , I know , but I find these sorts of things hard to say . They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV . Now I just hope the show will end soon .
__label__noemo	And you think I fit the qualifications ?
__label__joy	Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ’ s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot .
__label__noemo	if you have a few minutes , I'd like to talk to you about my future at this company .
__label__noemo	It's better for you .
__label__joy	I'm serious . You deserved this promotion .
__label__noemo	What if we purchase an increased quantity ? Can you give us better terms ?
__label__noemo	It costs ten cents a copy .
__label__noemo	Were you able to get a look at this person's face ?
__label__noemo	That's fine .
__label__noemo	I said , ' Do you need any help ? '
__label__noemo	I think I need a new notebook .
__label__noemo	You put the cup in the little cubby in the restroom and close the door to the cubby .
__label__noemo	I am sorry . All the seats are booked . How about next Monday ?
__label__noemo	My polling place is up the street at the park .
__label__noemo	while you ’ re cleaning the cooker , I ’ ll wipe the worktop . That was a great meat , by the way .
__label__noemo	I want to see ' Click . '
__label__noemo	You have taken words out of my mouth . He is a tough customer .
__label__noemo	Would you please bring me the black suit ? I want to try it on .
__label__noemo	I have never bought a house before and don ’ t know how to make an offer .
__label__noemo	Well , that's OK .
__label__noemo	I was wondering if the chef could leave off the sauce .
__label__noemo	I am worried .
__label__joy	Perfect . I wanted to have a casual evening tonight .
__label__noemo	I ’ ll be there in about an hour .
__label__noemo	You need to know the type of shoes you want .
__label__noemo	Thank you . When will I know if I am successful ?
__label__joy	Exactly .
__label__noemo	I can see the teapot , but I can ’ t see the tea .
__label__noemo	I need to check out this magazine .
__label__noemo	I've never really thought about it before . I guess it doesn't bother me .
__label__noemo	Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
__label__noemo	Hi Jim . Do you have a minute ?
__label__noemo	OK , make a left here . . . no wait , I meant make a right . Come on , speed up !
__label__noemo	Sure . How much do you want ?
__label__noemo	good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ?
__label__noemo	Well , I prefer to go on the train , but I suppose you want me to take the car .
__label__noemo	Where did you park at ?
__label__joy	I love you , too . And forgive Jack . He's doing his best .
__label__noemo	Yes . I have published some articles in China Daily and Economist .
__label__noemo	Yes , of course . You would be responsible for the development of software products .
__label__noemo	How would you like your hair set ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it is . Oh , by the way , could you also bring me today's paper ?
__label__disgust	I've been fed up with study .
__label__noemo	Yes , what a wonderful day ! The sky has cleared up in the end .
__label__noemo	Do you mean all the sales letters from them ?
__label__noemo	OK , I know what you mean . It's my treat .
__label__joy	Thank you , you are so thoughtful . I think I could use some beers right now .
__label__noemo	Yes . In that case , you should connect the operator and he will connect you with the one you want .
__label__noemo	I see .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	What kind of dog is he ?
__label__noemo	What about tonight ? Do you have plans tonight ?
__label__noemo	Let ’ s go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you .
__label__noemo	I can schedule you with him with no problem . We look forward to seeing you .
__label__noemo	Make yourself at home .
__label__noemo	Now what ?
__label__noemo	Sometimes , but I guess not very often . It's more for fun . Sometimes when I'm on a trip , for example , I can take a picture and send it to my kids . Or I can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately .
__label__noemo	I suggest you get off at the next stop and ask again at the station .
__label__noemo	Certainly . It's right over there .
__label__noemo	Don't you think it's too bloody ?
__label__noemo	OK . Let me see .
__label__noemo	Have you ever been to Xi ’ an ?
__label__noemo	The price per copy is ten cents .
__label__noemo	I'd like the first-class cabin for two . What's the fare ?
__label__noemo	that dress looks lovely on you , but it ’ s not very practical , is it ?
__label__noemo	Here's a twenty . Could you give me some more napkins ?
__label__noemo	I have been having skin problems that aren ’ t going away .
__label__noemo	Yeah , do you want something ?
__label__noemo	How much will the trip cost ?
__label__joy	Some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team !
__label__noemo	I am great ! How about you , Mary ? How are you ?
__label__joy	Not at all .
__label__surprise	Really ? Maybe I should work for you .
__label__noemo	That's good news . The car I'm interested in is priced at 120,000 RIB , but I think I can get a bit of discount on that . I can afford to put up around 40,000 RIB myself .
__label__joy	Oh , very good .
__label__joy	Oh , yes . I should be there sometime next spring .
__label__joy	It's a pleasure . Good night . Have a good sleep .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid we're really staffed this week , Mr . Li . I'd like to meet you , but I'm sorry I really can't .
__label__noemo	Lili , let ’ s take a vacation !
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	That's fine with me . I am willing to pay for it as long as you can guarantee me the package can arrive in time .
__label__noemo	How many years of experience do you have ?
__label__noemo	Well , I bet you will love them too . If you need help , just ask me any time . I am in the next door . You can also reach me through the extension 508 .
__label__noemo	Ok , sign here .
__label__noemo	Ok with me . You are the boss . I will meet you downstairs after work .
__label__noemo	Thank you , I am looking forward to hearing from you . Bye-bye .
__label__noemo	There . Stop !
__label__noemo	We guarantee the quality of the product for 12 months . We also provide a worldwide warranty .
__label__noemo	I want to use a credit card . Do you take Discover ?
__label__noemo	Yes , then enter the amount you want .
__label__noemo	Full coverage , please .
__label__noemo	Yes , I will . But how much is it ?
__label__noemo	Are you free this evening , Li ?
__label__noemo	Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea .
__label__noemo	Daniel wants to go to the aquarium . While Mom wants to visit the Summer Palace .
__label__noemo	Have you ever noticed that serious pollution in modern cities goes from bad to worse ?
__label__noemo	Unexpectedly , a girl threw a bucket of water on me .
__label__noemo	We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ?
__label__noemo	Sure . There is a folk concert tonight .
__label__noemo	When do you have time ?
__label__noemo	Actually you haven't had much .
__label__noemo	Could you hold my umbrella when I get my keys out , please ?
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__joy	Wonderful ! And , you mentioned ' perks ' ? I do hope I'll be getting some of those .
__label__noemo	Actually , I ’ d forgotten about it .
__label__noemo	Sure , but I don ’ t have hot water , yet .
__label__noemo	I'd like to have a shave .
__label__noemo	How about a snack after work ?
__label__noemo	Yes . And it was incorporated with other businesses in 2008 due to the global financial crisis .
__label__noemo	For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share .
__label__noemo	Well , I want to earn more .
__label__noemo	Me , too . I miss you . Are you any better ?
__label__noemo	Once in a while we have visitors from abroad and I would like to be able to ask my secretary to take them shopping and sightseeing .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Certainly .
__label__joy	That's reasonable . OK , thank you very much .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t really have one but I support Huston .
__label__noemo	What's the temperature today anyway ?
__label__noemo	this way , you'll earn more at the new work place .
__label__noemo	That ’ ll be all . Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	Yes , it has two bedrooms . That's convenient .
__label__noemo	Johnny , I wish you ’ d stop reaching for things . Haven ’ t you a tongue ?
__label__noemo	When do you leave ?
__label__noemo	There are many lakes and rivers in your country too . We also have many rivers , but only a few lakes .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I agree with you . But you know , it's just one of those things .
__label__noemo	Well , that was an interesting documentary !
__label__noemo	OK , sir , yours will be ready in a few seconds .
__label__noemo	No , that won ’ t do . I ’ ll take this smoked ham you have here .
__label__noemo	Er ... I'd like to know what time it is now .
__label__noemo	Do you have one of better quality ?
__label__noemo	I'm not sure yet.Maybe this will all be gone in a day.So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments . I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think .
__label__noemo	I accidentally knocked it off the table and it broke . I'm really sorry .
__label__noemo	Me , too . She speaks very clearly and doesn't use very complicated words so that it is easy for us to understand her .
__label__noemo	Happy Birthday , this is for you , Brian .
__label__noemo	What else can I get for you ?
__label__joy	Here , I'll help you type one up .
__label__noemo	They will need to know where you worked and how much money you made .
__label__noemo	I have a high fever and a bad headache .
__label__noemo	bye !
__label__noemo	I am really sorry for that .
__label__noemo	I understand . What should I tell Mr . Morley ?
__label__noemo	I'd be glad to answer any questions you may have .
__label__noemo	We have this beautiful platinum pendant , or you could also get her a locket . You could also get her a timepiece — it ’ s both glamorous yet functional.If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend , maybe I can help you find something for her .
__label__joy	Great ! I love swimming . Besides , I need a tan for Hill ’ s party ..
__label__noemo	The Yellow Rock National Park .
__label__noemo	Yes , but I still think it could be better .
__label__noemo	Really ? I like hot food . Can you make a few suggestions ?
__label__noemo	Sure , go ahead .
__label__noemo	You mean Lily ’ s boyfriend ?
__label__noemo	Some people get nasty on those comments . Maybe you should write him and ask nicely .
__label__noemo	I think it should be casual .
__label__joy	Thanks . I am starving . Tom , what are you getting ?
__label__noemo	I know .
__label__surprise	Are you serious ?
__label__noemo	Walter , did you email that document to Mr . Lin yesterday ?
__label__noemo	first of all , we'll tailor a work-out plan according to your physical conditions and your personal needs .
__label__noemo	The Grand Hotel ?
__label__noemo	You need to go to sleep now , so go to sleep .
__label__joy	Fantastic ! I didn't want to come back .
__label__noemo	Yes . Fortunately , an ambulance passed in the nick of time , and we got him away to hospital .
__label__noemo	Can you do push-ups ?
__label__noemo	Save it . If you want something to eat , then make it yourself .
__label__noemo	Should each of us write separately ?
__label__noemo	No problem . I'm an ' Olympic expert ' .
__label__noemo	She will be OK . She is a tough cookie .
__label__noemo	Hello , Lucy .
__label__noemo	I'm not used to other brands .
__label__noemo	And I had a dessert - that's another £ 3.50 . And you had coffee which is £ 2 .
__label__noemo	Let me get last week's notes .
__label__noemo	I'm not . I get a stomachache just thinking about it .
__label__noemo	I think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . When we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor .
__label__noemo	I'd like to get a good RPG . Can you recommend any ?
__label__noemo	That's for sure . I feel like I'm melting .
__label__noemo	Yes , of course . In accounting , cash means all items that are acceptable for depositing in a bank .
__label__noemo	Have you bought a bus pass yet ?
__label__joy	Sounds fine to me . Whatever , let's enjoy this pond first .
__label__noemo	I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you !
__label__noemo	I'm working on it !
__label__noemo	Why didn ’ t we choose an office in the CBD ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I did . I have them here .
__label__noemo	No problem.Call me when you get back .
__label__noemo	So , what are you going to do ?
__label__noemo	Ah yes , I can see it now . Where are the cups ?
__label__noemo	Besides , traffic signal in downtown area are very annoying , are they ?
__label__noemo	To tell you the truth , I'm not married . I'm still single .
__label__noemo	Okay . I ’ ll call you right back .
__label__noemo	You should be , because you ’ re a part of history .
__label__noemo	How can a business maximise revenues ?
__label__noemo	I'm not sure what to cook for dinner .
__label__noemo	All these countries in two weeks ?
__label__noemo	Just get the basics .
__label__noemo	How many copies am I allowed to make ?
__label__noemo	Yes , that's fine . Now when you finish these , I want you to put these cards in alphabetical order , using the last names , and then make a list .
__label__noemo	OK , just a moment ... yes , it has arrived . The amount is 51,998 US dollars net , 12 US dollars has been deducted by the intermediary bank .
__label__noemo	David , why didn ’ t you clean the room ?
__label__noemo	What does Mona like to do ?
__label__noemo	For sure ! I didn ’ t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US .
__label__noemo	In the interview , use polite words , such as ' Thank you ' , or ' Please ' .
__label__noemo	Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ?
__label__noemo	For starters , you want to do a lot of scouting first . You've got to know what things cost .
__label__noemo	Do you want cheese on it ?
__label__noemo	Yes . Everything is fine in the family . Don ’ t worry about the family . Just enjoy your trip . How ’ s the weather there ?
__label__noemo	Sure , you can , but you ’ ll be charged for $ 10 .
__label__noemo	I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It ’ s too plain on its own .
__label__noemo	This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it .
__label__noemo	All right . If you insist . Next time it is on me , though .
__label__joy	I ’ m really lucky to do something I really love .
__label__noemo	Sure . Large or medium ?
__label__joy	I can ’ t wait to go there myself .
__label__noemo	Well , Randy , I'd say you've got a bad case of the flu . The main thing to do is get plenty of rest and drink lots of liquids . I'll prescribe something for that throat .
__label__surprise	Really ? well , ok , you're welcome .
__label__noemo	That's strange . But probably , it is the new interview technique they call it ' Getting to know you more personally ' . What about your answers ?
__label__noemo	What are the seasons like in your city ?
__label__noemo	There are so many environment problems in the world today . Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ?
__label__anger	You know I wasn ’ t at the meeting . I was meeting with Mr . Wei about this account . I ’ Ve been on this for a month and a half .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , I would like to know something about this campus . Right now it seems very big and confusing ! I have no idea where I am going or what I am doing .
__label__joy	You know , now that I think about it , you might be right .
__label__noemo	OK . Here's my bank book , is that all right ?
__label__joy	Oh , I've never seen a better Mexican restaurant .
__label__noemo	I'll go back home with Danny . You go to the pharmacy again .
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__joy	That's good . And I can also recommend you a good one . It's the brand of DENY .
__label__noemo	Remember us for all your computer needs .
__label__noemo	So , will I be able to find this book ?
__label__noemo	What will the numbers tell me ?
__label__noemo	You will get a fine .
__label__joy	Nice ! Brunch !
__label__surprise	Really ? I think we play you guys next week . Well , I have to go to practice . See you later .
__label__noemo	A double cheeseburger sounds good .
__label__noemo	No , it's my brother's . I'm staying with him for a while .
__label__noemo	No , it is the original one .
__label__sadness	Oh , I'm sorry I bothered you . I'm really sorry .
__label__noemo	No . I'd like to do that now .
__label__noemo	I got on about fifteen minutes ago .
__label__noemo	All you need is your student identification card to check out books .
__label__noemo	I don't think so . I like them . Then what's your favorite book ?
__label__fear	I think someone is stalking me .
__label__noemo	Maybe I'll try that store out .
__label__noemo	Certainly . We always have the interest of the customers at heart .
__label__noemo	Hey , Maris , are you a part-timer ?
__label__noemo	Well , their inventors were not as clever as Bill Gates .
__label__noemo	Hello . Do you have anything for a little girl ?
__label__noemo	Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it .
__label__noemo	I didn't even think about that .
__label__noemo	And if you try to find a part-time job , you'll have some money too .
__label__joy	OK . Good night , then . Have a good sleep .
__label__noemo	My brother won a free trip and he's taking me .
__label__noemo	How do we spend our holiday ? Do you have any good ideas ?
__label__noemo	I need to purchase some business cards .
__label__noemo	But it's the same hairstyle .
__label__noemo	OK , Mr . Wang . Thank you very much for coming to the airport to see us off . Your great country and your hospitality have left a very deep impression on all of us and your working attitude and your way of doing business have changed my opinions about Chinese people .
__label__joy	Welcome , Li Mei . Please give me your coat and hat .
__label__joy	Yes , sir . What time would you like your table , sir ?
__label__joy	OK . Please step in . I know where it is .
__label__noemo	All right . You have a hamburger without mustard . Anything else ?
__label__noemo	You will stand over here up against this plate .
__label__noemo	I think I'm polite , careful , relaxed and shy .
__label__noemo	For example ?
__label__noemo	What about Flight 516 ?
__label__noemo	All set . May , can you help me take all these things to the living room ?
__label__noemo	Why not ?
__label__noemo	Well , we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of the mode of payment .
__label__noemo	It's on at 8 pm at the Phoenix Theatres . I have a membership there , so I can book the tickets ahead of time .
__label__noemo	From reading over your resume , I assume your English is quite good . Have you had any experience in the writing field ?
__label__joy	Sure , if you're done !
__label__noemo	Of course . What kind of postal savings account do you want to open ?
__label__noemo	Of course , what evening will you be joining us on ?
__label__noemo	Exactly what kind of help did you have in mind ?
__label__noemo	Well , Lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van 10 . We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . Trust me , it won ’ t cost much .
__label__noemo	They're all in order . If you just sign your name here , you'll receive your cards and pin numbers in the mail in about three weeks .
__label__noemo	OK .
__label__noemo	Hi , how is it going ?
__label__noemo	That sounds like a good job .
__label__noemo	how was your day ?
__label__noemo	You can have a broad choice here . Are you interested in a particular brand ?
__label__noemo	OK . How about this card then ?
__label__joy	But really , maybe this can work . Everyone loves coffee , and everyone needs motor oil .
__label__noemo	Try it and if you can't do it , one of us can always help you later .
__label__noemo	I am.What can I do for you ?
__label__noemo	I'll try to read one .
__label__noemo	Okay.Hey , is that a dark cloud over there ? Do you think it will rain after all ?
__label__noemo	Right , this way , please . Something to drink first ?
__label__noemo	Hello , I ’ d like to speak to Kate .
__label__joy	Well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . It was a magnificent sight !
__label__noemo	One Grand Slam breakfast for you !
__label__surprise	Why ?
__label__noemo	How many years of experience do you have ?
__label__noemo	Yes .
__label__noemo	Mary , be calm .
__label__joy	Hi ! My name is Mike .
__label__noemo	It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .
__label__noemo	See , I just told you he hit a deer . Man , I knew you weren ’ t listening to me .
__label__noemo	64 pounds , please .
__label__noemo	I haven't told them . Maybe I'll make them know after the vacation .
__label__joy	I have a couple of guest passes . You want to check out my health club ?
__label__noemo	I used to be a better singer . I haven't sung in the Karaoke for a long time . It's your turn .
__label__noemo	Anything else , Mr . Smith ?
__label__noemo	What would you like to eat , sir ?
__label__noemo	Hello , Mr . Hao . I am calling to tell you that you are not selected as our employee . Sorry .
__label__noemo	Oh , lots of things . Mostly training new people .
__label__sadness	I'm sorry . Something is wrong with my taxi .
__label__noemo	If we spend all the money , we will try and win the football pools again .
__label__anger	Your best isn't good enough . Back in my day , I'd clean a whole hospital with a toothbrush and spit , and it'd be twice as clean as this sty !
__label__noemo	Oh , yes.Erm , well , could you tell me your name , please ?
__label__noemo	I can see that . But I didn ’ t know you had experience in that line of work .
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__joy	She told me she liked my new haircut . She thought it was cool .
__label__noemo	What's your flight time ?
__label__noemo	Yes , where's the meat counter ?
__label__noemo	I don't think the teacher had a right to say that.The teacher was wrong to have accused her in front of the whole class .
__label__sadness	Oh dear , I ’ m late . I have to be in the office by 8am .
__label__noemo	What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .
__label__noemo	Yes , I ordered the express service .
__label__noemo	There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH !
__label__noemo	It's possible .
__label__noemo	He's an old antique , very serious .
__label__noemo	Of course . First you should do up your long hair and do make up but not too thick .
__label__noemo	We met them in Bermuda last May .
__label__noemo	Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law .
__label__noemo	This weekend would be OK with me .
__label__noemo	I'll put the song at the front of the list .
__label__noemo	As you know , china has a single-child policy . Therefore , there ’ s just my husband , my daughter and I . What about in your family ?
__label__noemo	Is Marisa in ?
__label__noemo	I don't know what else to drink .
__label__noemo	good . I ’ m going to prescribe something stronger . It will make you feel drowsy , so you certainly should rest .
__label__noemo	Will they need anything else from me ?
__label__joy	Thank you . Good afternoon Mrs . Smith , Miss Duncan , Miss Lamb .
__label__noemo	Yes , I do show your reservation . How could you like to pay for the room ?
__label__noemo	We will fine you .
__label__noemo	Yeah , they said they ’ re reviving the old tradition .
__label__noemo	So what's Michael Milliken up to these days ?
__label__noemo	This is Lincoln Bank , Consumer Credit Department . How can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Yes , It's fully furnished .
__label__noemo	Right , just wait a minute . I will get your bill ready for you right away .
__label__joy	You are quite right . Thank you for sharing your experience with me . I learned a lot .
__label__noemo	Shower , please .
__label__noemo	I have been there . It is in the middle of the mountains . It is not noisy there and you have to be a vegetarian .
__label__noemo	You've formed a sound habit .
__label__noemo	Twenties would be fine .
__label__noemo	I'm going to Shanghai early tomorrow morning . So I would like to request an early morning call .
__label__noemo	Did you hear anything about the robbery ?
__label__noemo	That'll be pretty heavy for a mid-day meal , don't you think ?
__label__noemo	Let me think ... I want to know if the company can provide free accommodation for a new employee .
__label__noemo	Oh , what does he look like ? Is he tall ?
__label__noemo	Jim and you are bosom friends , aren't you ?
__label__noemo	Sure , Richard . What ’ s on your mind ?
__label__joy	Thank you so much . You're an expert .
__label__noemo	Yeah , but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office . My stress is just about silly paperwork !
__label__noemo	Good evening . May I help you ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me , sir , your steamed crabs is coming .
__label__noemo	My cable has been out for the past week or so .
__label__noemo	I am Smith , the personnel director . Please have a seat , son .
__label__joy	ok , let ’ s go then !
__label__noemo	No kidding ! When did that happen ?
__label__noemo	Well , if it is elevated , you might have an infection .
__label__noemo	Wow , that's cutting it close ! That means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection ! What gate is it at ?
__label__noemo	Does it look too big ?
__label__noemo	Do you have any dutiable items ?
__label__noemo	Yeah . If you are available now , let me describe your work duties , OK ?
__label__surprise	What ? Seven hundred ?
__label__noemo	I found mine at IKEA .
__label__noemo	It's 325 a month . It's the biggest we've got in this area .
__label__noemo	I'm afraid I can't agree with you there . Your price is much higher than other companies .
__label__noemo	I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know that .
__label__joy	What a pin-up she is !
__label__noemo	Is that Sue ?
__label__noemo	the diet sodas don't have any caffeic in them , which one would you like ?
__label__noemo	It is ok . You look really pale and red eyes . I suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest .
__label__noemo	I hope so .
__label__joy	You certainly made a good impression on me , as well .
__label__noemo	It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ?
__label__noemo	And it's a brick ?
__label__noemo	This job pays sixty-five thousand dollars per year .
__label__joy	that sounds nice . How do you spend your mornings ?
__label__noemo	Exactly how old a box do you want ?
__label__noemo	Can you help me pick out a gift for my niece ?
__label__noemo	The pleasure is mine . It ’ s nice talking with you . Good-bye , Mr . Owens .
__label__noemo	150 pounds .
__label__noemo	Would you prefer some other time ?
__label__noemo	Never ever come to work drunk , also smoking in the office is not allowed .
__label__joy	A very nice curve ball by the pitcher . The catcher gives him the sign , he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive !
__label__noemo	No , Nancy , today I'm here to make a withdrawal . I made a formal request 7 days ago .
__label__noemo	The Perrier and the Jim Beam . Let me have three more of each .
__label__noemo	Of course I had heard about that , but now I know how expensive it is to rent a place here .
__label__noemo	Ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ?
__label__noemo	The weather this weekend is supposed to be warm .
__label__noemo	I felt after five years in one place , I was ready for something new . I would like to have a job that is challenging , something that I can see and do new things every day . I loved many things about my former job , and I left with amiable feelings on both sides . I was just ready for something new .
__label__noemo	Yup . Though the words he used are simple , but the spirit he has conveyed is great .
__label__noemo	Oh , I didn't actually teach in the schools . I taught after school . I taught in English institutes .
__label__noemo	What's the matter with you then ? You look miserable .
__label__noemo	Of course , Debbie . Let me look at my schedule , - - I have some free time on the 12th . That ’ s this Thursday at 9:00 a . m .
__label__noemo	Yes . They were open this morning when I came to work . They must've finished remodeling . Why do you want to know ?
__label__noemo	Yes . No need to change .
__label__noemo	Right . Red Rochester will officiate at the wedding .
__label__surprise	What ? I gave it to you only 3 months ago .
__label__noemo	Open it now .
__label__noemo	Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance .
__label__noemo	What's holding us back on the plant expansion project ? We were supposed to see the specs on that ages ago.Why haven't I heard anything about it ? Did the whole project just vanish into thin air ?
__label__joy	Thanks , Ma'am .
__label__noemo	I'm sorry , but you were the only one who had access to it .
__label__noemo	actually , some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass .
__label__noemo	Ok , would you like a phone with camera and MP3 player ?
__label__noemo	Sadly , I hardly ever speak to English people . I usually practice with my Chinese friends .
__label__noemo	Log on to the website of American Embassy in Beijing and fill in the application forms .
__label__noemo	Oh , I see . I am Jack White , Personnel Manager . Take a seat , please .
__label__anger	how dare you !
__label__noemo	Not a lot . What about you ?
__label__noemo	Are you excited about your trip next month ?
__label__noemo	New England .
__label__noemo	Should I accept their offer ?
__label__noemo	Jogging and bowling . Do you know how to practise Bungfu ?
__label__noemo	my mp3 player is broken , so I want to change it for an mp4 player . Can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ?
__label__joy	We had the grass cut and the flowers trimmed this morning .
__label__noemo	And also , the bank and branch name the company holds an account with and the account number .
__label__noemo	This position requires a high level of English ability . How is your spoken and written English ?
__label__noemo	Do you think though that ... that in . . . in a sense television skilled people's own er ... sort of , creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television ?
__label__noemo	I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves .
__label__noemo	Oh , hi Kim . How ’ s it going ?
__label__noemo	Please take a seat .
__label__joy	That sounds perfect.And let's go out for coffee after the show .
__label__noemo	Then you go out to the garage and check out the camping gear .
__label__surprise	Closed ? The clerk told me I could come back and register any time during the first week of classes .
__label__noemo	I have no plans on being back .
__label__noemo	But I ’ m just in it for the money , right ? How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies ? Besides , I love the smell of gasoline , don ’ t you ?
__label__noemo	Sometimes we even spend hours discussing our collections .
__label__noemo	I've brought this dress back to exchange it .
__label__noemo	Yes , coffee , please .
__label__surprise	I can't believe it . My parents never beat me .
__label__noemo	Excuse me , sir . Can I look at your ticket ?
__label__noemo	Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ’ s quite natural to us .
__label__noemo	Could you please cover for me two hours this morning ?
__label__noemo	Hold on . We will be successful right away .
__label__noemo	Hey there Chris , what are you up to ?
__label__noemo	yeah , but personally , I hate bargaining . If I bargain , I might come to a lower price , but I will never know the true price of what I am buying ; and I always have the feeling that I am overcharged at th
__label__noemo	OK , next ?
__label__noemo	Now where should I pay the money ?
__label__noemo	For about a week or so , but it ’ s gotten really bad in the last couple of days .
__label__noemo	I think so . I bought it four months ago .
__label__noemo	Of course , sir . Did you have anything from the minibar ?
__label__noemo	I just wanted to let you know what happened .
__label__noemo	That's Lincoln .
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__fear	Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do !
__label__noemo	Does it work ?
__label__noemo	Hi , Tony . You look unhappy . What's wrong ?
__label__noemo	When I was a kid , there was a weather who said there is no such thing as bad weather .
__label__noemo	Do you want to tell her ?
__label__noemo	Would you tell me when we get there ?
__label__noemo	Don ’ t chicken out ! Come on !
__label__noemo	Oh , that goes in the refrigerator .
__label__noemo	Good evening , sir . I understand that you have been robbed .
__label__noemo	How much must I pay ?
__label__noemo	Just go through the number eight to ticket barrier over there . A train will be in directly .
__label__noemo	What about our luggage ?
__label__sadness	I have to find something.Otherwise I have to go back to Taiwan . I'll be broke in two months .
__label__noemo	I'm not ready to get off the phone with you .
__label__noemo	Mom ! I was just picking my nose , and now it's bleeding .
__label__noemo	This kind of school is good at helping people to improve their English .
__label__noemo	All right . Here you are .
__label__noemo	Yeah , this place looks great . Wow , look at her , she can certainly get down , can't she ?
__label__joy	lt's a TV palace ! I'm glad I brought my platinum card .
__label__noemo	Dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day .
__label__surprise	Really ? How so ?
__label__noemo	Well , sounds promising . But I think our company will provide us with the language training courses if it is necessary . We need not bother signing for the language by ourselves .
__label__noemo	Where are you from , Sam ?
__label__noemo	I like your positive attitude . How many years have you been employed here ?
__label__noemo	I got to know your company through such famous brands as LUX , LIPTON and WALLS . After making a customer survey , I was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of Chinese .
__label__noemo	The workshop was only one afternoon long , do you really think you can learn that much in only a couple of hours ?
__label__noemo	No , don't worry . I'll get you off when you get there .
__label__noemo	Over there in the booth .
__label__noemo	Let's see.Yes.You ' Ve got quite a high temperature .
__label__joy	It is my pleasure to see you off .
__label__joy	I ’ m glad you could make it .
__label__noemo	And you ’ re going to completely transform your eating habits , right ?
__label__noemo	I need to go to the police station .
__label__disgust	You are lazy . You ought to be ashamed ? You should enjoy working .
__label__noemo	Do you have any plans for Veteran ’ s Day ?
__label__noemo	OK . But I hope it won't take too long .
__label__noemo	Are they going to frisk all the passengers ?
__label__noemo	Hi B . How are you ?
__label__noemo	Well , Yes . There are something wrong actually . Perhaps you can give me some advice .
__label__noemo	who ’ s it about ?
__label__noemo	Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know .
__label__noemo	I would like to return this item ... Are refunds allowed ?
__label__noemo	My whole family are going to Hainan for visiting . What about you ?
__label__noemo	How come ?
__label__noemo	I think so , too .
__label__joy	Thanks for coming .
__label__joy	Ok , that ’ s a good idea . Where shall we meet ?
__label__noemo	Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ?
__label__noemo	Would you mind going to dinner with me tonight ?
__label__noemo	Today is September 28th , 2007 .
__label__noemo	That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .
__label__noemo	Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ?
__label__noemo	Yes , we'll be there , come hell or high water !
__label__noemo	apparently , she's being given an award for donating so much money to charity .
__label__joy	It was fun for me , too . It gave me a chance to get away from my routine .
__label__joy	What a lovely gift . Yes , I can understand why you wouldn't be comfortable keeping something so valuable at home . I think one of our small ones will be perfect . Do you have some ID with you ?
__label__noemo	Fine , I've got that . And your company is ...
__label__noemo	In other parts of the world , especially in Africa , there is a problem with desertification . Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . In means that people cannot grow e
__label__noemo	I know , that's my problem . What do you think I should do ?
__label__noemo	No , not at all , but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine .
__label__noemo	I'm not sure . I don't know very much about the price of pearls .
__label__anger	That's not fair !
__label__noemo	I guess you are right . What do you think I should do ? He wasn ’ t always this grouchy you know ...
__label__noemo	There is my wife who does the accounts and my brother who helps with the sales .
__label__noemo	You ’ re absolutely right .
__label__joy	it's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ?
__label__noemo	What do you think of this one ? It's a 16 ” pan .
__label__noemo	I applied online .
__label__noemo	I know , but sometimes interviewers just want to hear you say it . Then you may be asked for your viewpoint on why you feel you are qualified for the job , give them all your qualifications and how you think they will fit the position you are applying for . Questions like what sort of experience do you have and what are your goals ? are closely related to this .
__label__noemo	We have an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 . we can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn ’ t mind , as long as we get out work done on time .
__label__noemo	What about the fight schedule ?
__label__noemo	Do you want to buy a sweater ?
__label__joy	Great . My assistant will wash your hair , and then I'll be back to help you .
__label__noemo	Sure . How about my passport ?
__label__noemo	How long is this bus ride ?
__label__noemo	Fine . How long does it take to get to 82nd Street ?
__label__noemo	Hi . Can you give me a wake-up call tomorrow ?
__label__noemo	Not rally . 200 years ago , it was just a small insignificant village .
__label__joy	Great ! I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers .
__label__noemo	How about your tongue ? Does it still hurt ?
__label__joy	Oh wow ! Thanks a million , Angie !
__label__noemo	And this bedroom is too big and damp . But it ’ s better than a tent .
__label__joy	Thank you for you help .
__label__noemo	How many diners will be in your group ?
__label__noemo	Drinking is just part of it . I mean , you have a bunch of friends coming by and having fun . You drink and talk . And the more you drink , the more you talk . It makes me so relaxed .
__label__noemo	This automobile is just right for your needs because not only is it compact for ease in city driving , but also , it has many safety features . I know that as a parent , you are concerned about safety in driving your kids to and from school .
__label__noemo	I know , and that's why I'm always respectful and I keep my distance . It's safer that way .
__label__noemo	I've never counted .
__label__noemo	You never cook . I always do .
__label__surprise	Really ? So what ’ s the news ?
__label__noemo	I think my car can run much faster than yours .
__label__noemo	well , you can simply tell them you want to sleep , or make an arrangement for a time when the room should quiet down .
__label__noemo	Sure , it ’ s 4-8- 7-2 . Don ’ t worry . You ’ re doing a fine job .
__label__noemo	Well , I collect beer mats . I ’ m not sure that counts , though .
__label__noemo	Well , I ’ m looking to get a custom-made suit .
__label__noemo	Tall building ... Which side is the building on ?
__label__joy	I wish you luck .
__label__noemo	Yes , because of fewer people .
__label__noemo	Must I catch a number 7 bus to get there ?
__label__noemo	Why ? They are fine .
__label__noemo	I took out a life insurance policy and make my wife beneficiary .
__label__noemo	Did you get your bus pass ?
__label__noemo	then , you're probably addicted .
__label__noemo	They get higher level English , which is more formal than everyday spoken English . They also deal with matters of style and creativity .
__label__surprise	Really ? That's nice .
__label__noemo	What do you do there ... hang around , like the kids ?
__label__noemo	Yes , it took a year and a lot of initiative to get that account .
__label__noemo	Fine , but first I need some information about you .
__label__joy	Can ’ t be better , it was wonderful . We had a lot of fun there . There was so much joy and walk and breathe the winter air . We arrived at the park at 9 o ’ clock in the morning and didn ’ t leave till 3 o ’ clock in the afternoon .
__label__noemo	Yes , thanks . By the way , what time do I have to start check-in ?
__label__noemo	No , no ... It was just the wrong size .
__label__joy	Yeah . I am so excited that Obama won .
__label__noemo	How Ay clients do you have already ?
__label__noemo	OK . Do you think I can play football tomorrow ?

__label__noemo	Do you take in students ?
__label__noemo	Let me try it on . I like that color .
__label__noemo	I have been at the job I now have for 2 years , and I have been with the company for 6 years total .
__label__noemo	Easier said than done .
__label__noemo	Hi , Lucy , you are very popular with people around you , what are your tricks ?
__label__noemo	Most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home .
__label__noemo	Yes , we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures .
__label__anger	That's sheer robbery !
__label__noemo	Let me key in your information into my computer . I will pull up our records for you . Do you have an order number ? What name is the order listed under ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I see .
__label__noemo	Every year , the South has the floods . It is an act of God .

__label__noemo	It really depends on when and how long .

__label__noemo	Yes , a single , thanks .
__label__noemo	Well , let me see ... This Stephen King novel is a real thriller .
__label__noemo	That ’ s quite a while . Let ’ s make it the week after you get back , then .
__label__noemo	Don't worry . You can draw your money at any time . But you'll not receive the time deposit return of interest . What we can offer is a current one .
__label__noemo	I suppose you're right.He can't have remembered .
__label__noemo	Please .
__label__noemo	Good . That will help me know how I am doing .
__label__noemo	Hi , Mr . Zhang . What ’ s wrong ? You don ’ t look so happy . How was your date ?
__label__noemo	Twice a year ? How long has your sister lived in Boston ?
__label__noemo	What else would you like ?
__label__noemo	I need to make sure that my wife will be financially secure if I die .
__label__noemo	Waitress ! My bill for today's lunch , please .

__label__noemo	I want to make more contact with extra clients and use my organizational skills in the future .
__label__noemo	I'll make it up next week .
__label__surprise	I can ’ t believe you didn ’ t know when the elections were .
__label__noemo	I don't go to hairdressers because they're cute .
__label__noemo	OK , could you give me your details and I'll see if it has cleared . We need your banking details and some ID . A passport or something like that ?
__label__noemo	Can you tell me what happened here ?
__label__noemo	Tom , promise me to keep this a secret , will you ?
__label__noemo	Well , I have to take biology , chemistry , maps and physics . What you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors .
__label__noemo	Well feel free to ask me anything , and I ’ ll try to fill in the details .
__label__noemo	He said I ' d got the flu .
__label__noemo	Julia , I apologize to you for what I have done . Please forgive me .

__label__surprise	Why do you say that ?
__label__noemo	It says ' No smoking here ' .
__label__noemo	I would now like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter-offer .
__label__noemo	You can deposit an initial amount of five dollars .
__label__disgust	I hate this kind of weather !
__label__sadness	Sorry . You have to buy your ticket at the next counter .
__label__noemo	She definitely deserves 20 % for a tip .

__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__noemo	Sure . Then what about trying the treadmill or the skipping rope .
__label__noemo	Hi charles , I want you know that i finally found an apartment in haitian .
__label__noemo	Yes . I think they should just let them fly free , and not try to sell them to foreigners . It is a kind of destruction of nature .
__label__noemo	First , change your shoes to slippers . Then walk up to the changing room to get prepared for a shower .
__label__noemo	Yes , you can add or get rid of channels later on if you would like .
__label__joy	Ernie , I'm really excited about starting this band together . We're going to be the two coolest students on campus .
__label__noemo	I ’ m a firefighter .
__label__noemo	No idea . Your guess is as good as mine .
__label__anger	Listen , Christine , you can not afford another day off . You ’ Ve called in sick five times in the last three weeks .
__label__noemo	It doesn't matter .

__label__noemo	No , you can not . It is dangerous .
__label__noemo	And thanks to you .
__label__noemo	Yes . It ’ s not perfectly round like a football . A rugby ball is oval in shape . There ’ s a match on TV this afternoon . Why don ’ t you watch it with me ? I ’ ll try to explain the rules and tactics while we ’ re watching .
__label__noemo	There's a lot of rain in summer , but it seldom rains in autumn .
__label__surprise	You ? Play badminton ? That's unbelievable ! You are shorter than a racket .
__label__noemo	I have found it quite different here from China since I came to the United States .
__label__noemo	well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places .
__label__noemo	and how about Internet access ?
__label__noemo	I'm so hungry , I could eat a whole cow !
__label__noemo	That's fine . Do you have any specials for your guests ?
__label__noemo	For a local call , just insert 35 cents in the slot and use it in the same way as your home phone . Inquiries are free from a public phone .
__label__noemo	I'm fine for now , thanks .
__label__joy	No problem .
__label__noemo	Inspection is to be done by the China Commodity Inspection and Testing Bureau . Usually inspection is conducted within five days before each shipment .
__label__noemo	It's true . If a person doesn't exercise , they get sluggish.That ' s why I keep running . Even in the winter .
__label__noemo	No , not yet . Can you find a good price there ?
__label__joy	Thank you !
__label__noemo	Thanks , but I couldn't eat another bite . I'm really full .
__label__noemo	no , we're not . We've been drifting apart for a while .
__label__noemo	It sounds that sandstorms are trouble for everybody !
__label__noemo	All right . Let me see . I think you'd wear a size 8 . This shirt is size 8 .
__label__noemo	Yes . When your friend gets it , he ’ ll sent the receipt which you send it by mail . then you can be sure he ’ s received .
__label__noemo	Schedule it for this afternoon , when Ken gets back .
__label__noemo	Yes , you have a paid month holiday every year .
__label__noemo	It's rice wine , a kind of still wine , somewhat like Japanese Sake . Showing is a city in China .
__label__fear	Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven ’ t bought my mom anything ! I ’ m such a bad son !
__label__noemo	Great ! What if I need to print something in the lobby ?
__label__noemo	What do you mean ?
__label__joy	Yes , I like collecting things .
__label__noemo	I want the latest fashion , can you make some suggestions ?
__label__noemo	Maybe . I'll have to ask my mother .
__label__noemo	What kind of winter sport do you like best ?
__label__noemo	What was that you just said ? Last one ... ? Hey , they've closed the ticket window !
__label__noemo	You may ask questions about us , if you have any .
__label__joy	Thank you .
__label__noemo	Because it helps you speed up your circulation .
__label__noemo	Because I need to use the restroom . Is there a restroom on the train ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me , miss.Should I check in here for taking MS121 to Florence ?
__label__noemo	how have you been ?
__label__noemo	Ok , I will go there myself .
__label__noemo	I don't want to go alone .
__label__noemo	What time do you open and close on Saturday ?
__label__noemo	I just received a phone call for an interview next week .
__label__joy	Really ? That's really wonderful . I'm so happy for her .
__label__noemo	Trying to get in shape ?
__label__noemo	If you're so hungry , why don't you ask someone else for money ?
__label__noemo	What are you going to do with it ?
__label__noemo	He is short , well-built , and he ’ s got light blond hair .
__label__noemo	Thank you , please fill out this form for us .
__label__noemo	You have a lot of gifts , so you have to pay for the camera .
__label__noemo	She can't answer you .
__label__noemo	I think it's too short . You'd better say something about your work experience .
__label__noemo	That's my only option right now .
__label__joy	I've had a great time and thank you for your spending so much time showing me around .
__label__noemo	What ’ s the room rate ?
__label__noemo	OK . What time is it ?
__label__noemo	I'm still just surprised you really want to do it.It doesn't seem to go with your character .
__label__noemo	How tall are you ? What about your eyesight ?
__label__noemo	He got the scholarship to Harvard .
__label__noemo	Excuse me . What's the actual flight time from here to San Francisco ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I do . I ’ ll walk you there .
__label__noemo	It ’ s a pity we can ’ t afford a house . A garden would be so nice .
__label__noemo	The file for the meeting needs to be retyped and please send it to us as soon as possible .
__label__noemo	But I heard that she had a three-year-old girl .
__label__noemo	I'm absolutely sure I'm right .
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__noemo	We started dating right away .
__label__noemo	How's it ?
__label__noemo	I have some shirts that need laundering , and I ’ d like my suit pressed .
__label__noemo	My parents are already here . My brother and nephew are arriving on Monday .
__label__noemo	OK , I will take one .
__label__sadness	He told me that his friend's car broke down and they had to walk home .
__label__noemo	Yes , of course .
__label__joy	Hello , darling ! Did you have a good day today ?
__label__noemo	Roast beef .
__label__noemo	I think I'm going to look for another job . I need to find a boss that is a bit more sensitive and optimistic than my current boss .
__label__noemo	Understanding comes from product differentiation.We get that through product demonstration , literature , expert testimonials , and the like .
__label__noemo	What attracted you to this job ?
__label__noemo	OK , but make sure that everything is back by Sunday night at the latest .
__label__noemo	Do you like plum blossoms ?
__label__noemo	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	Get in .
__label__noemo	I do back flips at the pool all the time .
__label__noemo	You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important thing is to remember to keep your body straight . Many people bend the
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__noemo	What are your expectations from working on this job ?
__label__noemo	"I thought it was "" the same day "" service.Anyway , please do hurry ."
__label__noemo	Then , why didn't you do that ?
__label__noemo	yeah , I guess so .
__label__noemo	I see . It must be worth going to .
__label__noemo	Why do you think it wasn ’ t higher than that ?
__label__noemo	$ 100 .
__label__noemo	I have a question .
__label__noemo	I am trying to see if I can afford to purchase a home that I wish to buy .
__label__noemo	Yes . Do you know where it is ?
__label__noemo	I was wondering if I could borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend .
__label__noemo	By credit card .
__label__noemo	Eggs , milk , bread . Things like that .
__label__noemo	Yesterday I saw your company's advertisement . Your company is an important international company . Working for it , I believe it can improve my abilities .
__label__noemo	It is said that greens can improve our metabolism . In addition , I want to keep fit .
__label__noemo	I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher .
__label__joy	It ’ s nice . I arrived safely .
__label__noemo	I am afraid I can't finish typing it this afternoon.When will you use it tonight ?
__label__noemo	Does Mark Wyatt work there ?
__label__noemo	Does the test cover everything in the manual ?
__label__noemo	What should I do ?
__label__noemo	Tell me about it ! It's like the whole world is broiling .
__label__noemo	We could try it for the first few weeks and see if she likes it .
__label__noemo	At 13:15 .
__label__noemo	What's your favorite hobby ?
__label__noemo	Not a lot , actually . Busy at work of course - we've got a big project coming up in Malaysia . I may have to go to KL in a few weeks .
__label__joy	it's ok . It seems we have a lot in common .
__label__noemo	That's a chick flick !
__label__noemo	I need some help catching up . Are you good at typing or could you help me xerox ?
__label__anger	It ’ s okay . I don ’ t want to go now . We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning .
__label__noemo	We have a special on these skirts this week . Would you like to try one on ?
__label__noemo	You would need to speak to Ms.Stevens .
__label__joy	I love your home-made apple pie.It ’ s delicious.Can I have another glass of lemonade as well ?
__label__noemo	Take your used textbooks with you and give them to the representative near the entrance . He will pay you for them . Are you going today ?
__label__noemo	I agree . Reading for fun is why all the English students at our family school have excellent English . All the students read 800 easy storybooks during their second year of studying English .
__label__noemo	By the way , can I open a checking account too ?
__label__noemo	Yes , she really went out of her way to make this a pleasant dining experience .
__label__noemo	No , it's the Japanese team .
__label__noemo	why don't you join us ? We are leaving next week ; you'll still have a week to prepare .
__label__noemo	you dance it very well . do you often go dancing ?
__label__noemo	I'm looking for some black pumps to go with my evening gown . Could you show me what you have ?
__label__noemo	Easy . I could do that with my eyes closed . ( after a while ) Done .
__label__noemo	Perhaps the food was bad .
__label__noemo	I know I should be pretty happy here , but I'm not finding the kind of job satisfaction I need . I'm a good graphic designer ...
__label__surprise	I'm surprised . He does't look like a guy who'd ever cheat on his wife , does he ?
__label__noemo	These are called All Star Chuck Taylors .
__label__noemo	politicians like to ignore the problems of the working class . They like to focus on making life easier for the upper class .
__label__noemo	Do you want the truth ?
__label__anger	I know . I still haven't heard from her . The good thing is that I'm so angry with her that I don't feel sad about not having her around .
__label__joy	I don't know , but you know how to surround yourself with great friends !
__label__noemo	there's an opening in the creative design department . It involves working with computers .
__label__noemo	What courses did you take in college ?
__label__noemo	What are you reading ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much .
__label__noemo	He got arrested all right .
__label__noemo	All right , and what about the older gentle ?
__label__noemo	Do you think it'll be full now ?
__label__noemo	I have a headache . Is there anything I can buy without a prescription ?
__label__noemo	Have you always been on this site ?
__label__noemo	We ’ re trying to raise money for the campaigns .
__label__noemo	Oh , they all went out ! Did you make a wish ?
__label__noemo	umm ... yeah ! I ’ m looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend . Our fifth anniversary ’ s next Friday .
__label__noemo	Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap .
__label__noemo	Well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you ask me what I value most in a friend , I would have to say honesty .
__label__noemo	Well , I am just afraid they won't like my Chinese way of cooking .
__label__noemo	Would you like any cash back ?
__label__noemo	What did you do ?
__label__noemo	Not really . It pinches my toes .
__label__noemo	Can you work part-time or full-time ?
__label__noemo	Is it far ?
__label__noemo	You're lucky there was no lasting damage . I'll set up an appointment for you to come back in five days . We'll take those stitches out then . So long .
__label__joy	Oh , my shoes pinch me . Let's find a seat and sit a while .
__label__noemo	Wow , is that your sports car ?
__label__noemo	Do you know where the local office for this area is ?
__label__noemo	I'm Robert , at your service .
__label__noemo	Come some time next week if you like . I think we'll have got some by then .
__label__noemo	Are you making what I think you're making ?
__label__noemo	Check , please .
__label__noemo	When would you like me to send those plans over to your office , Mr . Montgomery ?
__label__noemo	Is this your handbag ?
__label__noemo	I think 250 dollars should be sufficient .
__label__noemo	They could generally be divided into two categories , direct and indirect contaminant sources .
__label__surprise	Really ? Well . Ok . Get the receipts out .
__label__noemo	You can take No . 1 bus or taxi
__label__noemo	When you need an apartment , where do you look for one ?
__label__noemo	Are you ready to order now , sir ?
__label__noemo	Because you're from a foreign country . The school needs to find out how good you are at both basic skills .
__label__noemo	Will you please explain the meaning of this word ?
__label__noemo	Do you need every color in the rainbow ?
__label__noemo	Who's your favorite singer ?
__label__noemo	I think the valve is faulty . I couldn't regulate the pressure and the seal burst . I tried opening the emergency valve but it was jammed .
__label__noemo	Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ?
__label__noemo	Let ’ s see ... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars .
__label__joy	Don't mention it .
__label__noemo	You can go online to begin the application process .
__label__noemo	Yes , I never seem to have any energy .
__label__noemo	Hi , Mike , where are you going ?
__label__noemo	What are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ?
__label__noemo	Here you are .
__label__noemo	i like my professors and the classes , but it's a lot of work .
__label__noemo	Well , I remember walking pass the baker shop .
__label__sadness	They were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and I ’ m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ’ Ve had all day .
__label__noemo	it wasn't cold out this morning .
__label__noemo	Hi , is that Jason ?
__label__joy	Oh , really ! It looks so different . Our old place turns into a brand new place .
__label__joy	Thank you , I know where that is .
__label__noemo	Think it over . We hope to keep a good business relationship with you .
__label__noemo	I'll tell you what , I'll go over the number again with our financial team and see what I can do . I can't give you any guarantees . But we can try .
__label__noemo	Yeah . How are you these days ?
__label__noemo	They look like running shoes.They have the same shape . And you can use them for running too.But they're not so serious . They aren't designed for serious runners.You can use them for exerce
__label__noemo	Thank you . Have a nice trip .
__label__noemo	Is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ?
__label__joy	Yes , I have everything here . OK , I'll come in and see you later today . Maybe I could have my new car as early as next week ! How exciting !
__label__noemo	I'll be glad when winter comes .
__label__noemo	I like people who are open and friendly . Those people are usually more active and fun to be with . I like spending time with my friends . We go to bars together or play sports together .
__label__noemo	Yes , if you think it will help .
__label__noemo	You're right , we do need leadership . But what we don't need is too many people to lead us . You know what they say about too many chiefs and not enough Indians ...
__label__noemo	Oh , I ’ m going to meet my girlfriend in Thailand .
__label__noemo	What ? How did that happen ?
__label__noemo	What about the other class ?
__label__noemo	All right , now please sign the back of the card .
__label__noemo	I think she just likes to make us miserable .
__label__noemo	No . Dad . We have a tour guide .
__label__joy	Thanks , Jim . I didn ’ t think guys paid attention to stuff like that .
__label__noemo	Well . First you have to turn this switch on .
__label__noemo	Sure , no problem . I'll ring to have a city tour.on sunday morning we can go to the Great Wall , then we can go to the summer palace in the afternoon . In the evening we can have typical dinner in restaurant in Beijing . Quanjude , a restaurant serving roast ducks . However if you don't like above trips , we can go some famous places outside of Beijing .
__label__noemo	All I need is your name , phone , and reservation date .
__label__noemo	Yes . Is there anything you can give me to get rid of it , doctor ?
__label__noemo	What methods do you use to conserve water ?
__label__noemo	I got stuck in a traffic jam .
__label__surprise	Dave then ? Dave is a spy for WebTracker ? You can't be serious .
__label__noemo	I'll take some , too .
__label__noemo	Will you exfoliate the skin as well ?
__label__joy	Wow . I'd love to .
__label__noemo	Oh , uh ... Thanks . Henry , do you have a light ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I'd like to know if there would be any future opportunities for specific training .
__label__noemo	Give me a chance to explain . I was no my way and I had an accident .
__label__noemo	Do you ?
__label__noemo	Do you have the receipt with you ?
__label__noemo	Absolutely .
__label__noemo	Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly .
__label__noemo	A lot of people in my dorm are sick . Perhaps I picked it up there .
__label__joy	Yes , please . That would be a great help . Are you sure you don ’ t mind ?
__label__noemo	Well , I want to become just like Bruce Lee . What should I do ?
__label__noemo	May I renew them if I haven't finished reading them ?
__label__noemo	Certainly . No one can match us as far as speed is concerned .
__label__noemo	yes , I have . I need them to help me with these new dished I ’ m trying to make . I need a little more practice before I invite guests over .
__label__noemo	OK , but do you want to talk to your wife if she calls ?
__label__noemo	I haven't lately .
__label__noemo	Maybe you should .
__label__noemo	Please fill out the table .
__label__noemo	That would be nice . How are you getting there ?
__label__noemo	Over there .
__label__noemo	Have your mechanics finished yet ?
__label__noemo	Where do they sell both at ?
__label__noemo	What kind of teaching certificate do you have ?
__label__noemo	Oh , I see .
__label__fear	I think you have chicken pox ! You are contagious ! Get away ! Don ’ t breathe on me !
__label__noemo	Yes , sir . We have the all-inclusive luxury cruise . Maybe you would like to look at the itinerary .
__label__noemo	We must set 1000 dollars aside each month .
__label__noemo	We ’ Ve still got a lot of time before we have to start running .
__label__joy	Thanks a lot . By the way , do you make the deliveries ?
__label__noemo	I see . Well , this bank offers many different accounts of this nature . There are 7 to choose from
__label__noemo	That ’ s what I am here for . What questions can I answer for you ?
__label__noemo	Impossible . How about 5 % off ?
__label__noemo	Got it.Let ' s call these two and see if we can make appointments to see the apartments .
__label__noemo	There was a concert country music last week .
__label__noemo	Please pay close attention to the safety of the shipment .
__label__noemo	I have no idea .
__label__noemo	No . That ’ s fine .
__label__noemo	Anyway , we apologize for the inconvenience we have brought you . Please just wait for a moment , and it will be fixed .
__label__noemo	No . Everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . The most important thing is to be responsible for your work .
__label__noemo	I need to buy a bus pass .
__label__noemo	It ’ s not you , is it ?
__label__noemo	Okay , sir , but remember how close it is to your checkout time .
__label__noemo	OK . Do you want any film ?
__label__noemo	Do you want me to go talk to her ?
__label__noemo	I know . Every day the weather seems different .
__label__noemo	It's on the 7th floor . As you get off the elevator , you'll see it on your left .
__label__noemo	should I bring anything ?
__label__noemo	I think that there are too many of them . I think that companies spend far too much money on advertising . They should have lower prices instead . Then they would see more .
__label__noemo	OK . Have you seen the samples ?
__label__noemo	Also some traditional Chinese food , like noodles and dumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality . I heard this year , the government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hygiene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control .
__label__noemo	It seldom rains this summer .
__label__noemo	Not yet . I don't know how to fill out the form . What is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent ?
__label__noemo	I'm going to go hiking . Do you want to join me ?
__label__noemo	and fruits !
__label__noemo	According to our regulations , you will be on probation for the first three months .
__label__noemo	OK , I'll just check out a few other stores .
__label__joy	Sounds pretty good . What about the charge ?
__label__noemo	Yes , could you please go over this for me ? and see if there is any mistake in it ?
__label__noemo	At eight thirty .
__label__joy	Awesome . Was someone killed there ?
__label__joy	Sounds like a good idea .
__label__noemo	Yeah me too . Oh ! Can we stop at the shop really fast ? I lost my makeup bag at the airport and I want to pick up a few things .
__label__joy	You are witty .
__label__noemo	Okay , can I ask you something direct ?
__label__noemo	I graduated with honors . I had a 3.9 .
__label__noemo	I'll have steak .
__label__noemo	Yeah . I'm still hungry , but I guess it's kind of rude to keep eating while he's talking , huh ?
__label__noemo	Yes , of course . But I think they can make you a salty one , too .
__label__noemo	I think luck played a very small part in your victory . It is solely due to your hard work and efforts . That brings honor to you and joy to us .
__label__noemo	I usually go every other day for about 3 hours .
__label__noemo	How ?
__label__noemo	It's so spacious , about 40 square metres , right ?
__label__joy	No , really , it feels great .
__label__noemo	Is your wife with you ?
__label__joy	No , have a nice day !
__label__noemo	I think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . If most people have similar amounts of money , they will not think of stealing from others .
__label__surprise	Oh , really ?
__label__noemo	Look at him , he's buff .
__label__noemo	I want a two-bedroom apartment .
__label__noemo	Where is your domicile ?
__label__noemo	OK . please fill in this form and label it .
__label__noemo	The Russian team needs to tie the Ukraine to get the pass for the final .
__label__noemo	What is it ?
__label__noemo	In 3 months or so .
__label__noemo	Let's see ... You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean , and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles .
__label__noemo	Yeah , I know , this is Popeye's favorite food .
__label__noemo	It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public .
__label__noemo	The Ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
__label__noemo	Which train is that ? Which platform does it leave from ?
__label__noemo	Sure . First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic .
__label__noemo	The plumbing seems OK , too .
__label__noemo	May I see your ID , please , Mr . Sandals ?
__label__noemo	The demographic reports are in ... From the looks of it , we're going to have to re-evaluate some of the content for our promotional events in different venues .
__label__noemo	Yep , it ’ s near a bus stop .
__label__noemo	Now it's a question of getting there . I need a flight to Paris on Sunday evening and a hotel in Paris for 3 nights . I have to be in Frankfurt by 11 on Thursday morning . And I will need a hotel for one night . I will head home on Friday .
__label__noemo	Yes , my customers have started to complain too !
__label__noemo	Are you keeping the small bag as carry-on luggage , sir ?
__label__joy	Well , most importantly the apartment is beautiful .
__label__noemo	Thank you .
__label__joy	You're welcome .
__label__noemo	It's about two days .
__label__noemo	OK , here's your question What movie won the 1996 Oscar for Best Picture ?
__label__noemo	Didn't you bring his favorite toy ?
__label__noemo	Oh , you mean kikois .
__label__noemo	Who wants to go first ? Allen ?
__label__noemo	Why ?
__label__noemo	You know I don't know anything about fashion .
__label__noemo	Thought about what ?
__label__noemo	May I take your order now , sir ?
__label__noemo	Yes , I am . I arrived only three days ago from Japan .
__label__noemo	I guess so .
__label__noemo	Then I'll come to your place later in the evening , and how late is your shop open ?
__label__noemo	Ordinarily , as soon as you are seated , you put your napkin on your lap .
__label__noemo	I don ’ t think she will do such a thing .
__label__noemo	Oh OK , where do I get off ?
__label__noemo	Can you make a suit for me to order ?
__label__joy	sure . You can buy almost anything you can think of .
__label__noemo	Are you interested in today's special ?
__label__joy	Hope to see you again . We will provide the best service .
__label__noemo	About six years ...
__label__noemo	Sorry.We don't have a printed one . Is there anything else I can do for you ?
__label__noemo	Most of them are from America and Europe .
__label__noemo	Ok , let's sign it .
__label__noemo	Are you ready to order ?
__label__joy	I really appreciate your help .
__label__noemo	You know what ? I don ’ t really need the money . Thanks anyways !
__label__joy	I couldn't agree more !
__label__noemo	How frustrating ! The bus is still not coming .
__label__noemo	We can complete a trade by email , electronic data interchange and smart cards , and so on .
__label__noemo	She tried , but the line is always busy .
__label__noemo	My boots ? Er ... Sure , ok .
__label__noemo	Would you like that drink blended or on the rocks ?
__label__surprise	Yikes ! What was that noise ?
__label__noemo	Is there anything else at the EDD offices to help me with my job search ?
__label__noemo	We'll be coming in tomorrow to make a rather large cash withdrawal , it's for payroll .
__label__noemo	Morning , Madam . This is the window for Foreign Exchange Savings . How can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Do you like singing ?
__label__joy	Certainly . Here it is .
__label__noemo	Where can I park my car ?
__label__noemo	It is all up to you .
__label__noemo	if Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won .
__label__noemo	Yes . So ?
__label__noemo	Excuse me , could you give me change for a dollar ?
__label__joy	I like to play the piano for fun .
__label__noemo	Good morning , sir .
__label__noemo	Who knows . After all , he is handsome and rich .
__label__noemo	I heard Rose is pregnant . I hope it'll be a boy this time .
__label__joy	Me , too .
__label__noemo	We have read about this in your sales literature . Could you give us some idea of your prices ?
__label__noemo	I was in the Law School in Harvard University .
__label__noemo	I wonder if I can see your mother , little boy . Is she engaged ?
__label__noemo	Oh , no .
__label__noemo	Yes . I'd like to make a plane reservation to Shanghai , China .
__label__joy	Perfect . So , I guess my next job is to go to the newsagent and buy some car magazines . Thanks for everything .
__label__noemo	Sure .
__label__noemo	Yes , there's one just on the other side of this building . Do you have any small change ?
__label__joy	That ’ s fantastic ! You really got me there .
__label__noemo	Yes . Baked eggs and buttered toast . I like my baker very crazy .
__label__noemo	We can transfer the funds each month , at your request , into each employee's account . It is possible to pay in cash or to pay directly to the employee's savings account , no matter which bank they do business with .
__label__noemo	I know.Do you have some change I can borrow ?
__label__noemo	Good morning . I'd like to have a haircut .
__label__noemo	It ’ s okay sir , calm down . What happened ?
__label__noemo	It doesn't take long at all
__label__joy	Well , I was looking in this magazine the other day and cruises are not very expensive at all . Take a look at this !
__label__anger	You ’ re making my blood boil .
__label__noemo	Can I help you ?
__label__noemo	Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ?
__label__noemo	What salary do you get for your present position ?
__label__joy	Yes . Let ’ s sleep on the sand . That ’ s most exciting !
__label__noemo	Excuse me , sir .
__label__noemo	Oh , don't worry about that here . There are security guards on duty 24 hours a day and they patrol all over the neighborhood . You know , they are all very strong .
__label__noemo	But number 13 buses leave from the centre of town . You'll have to walk two miles to catch one .
__label__noemo	Oh , tell him I ’ ll leave them at his office tomorrow afternoon .
__label__noemo	Well , I last had a haircut eight weeks ago . So my hair is pretty long.But I want the same style .
__label__noemo	I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair , that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on . But only time will tell .
__label__noemo	It's only about 10 minutes ' walk .
__label__noemo	How much does it cost ?
__label__noemo	Peter Madsen . A great A if I do say so myself .
__label__noemo	What about cash ?
__label__noemo	When will there be a job fair ?
__label__noemo	Jodi , I must get a hold of Jim today , but I forgot his address and phone number .
__label__noemo	Ok . But can I trade my seat with you ? I prefer the one near the window . I'm a terrible flyer . I always get airsick and can never relax until after I've landed .
__label__noemo	I live on Las Flores and Fair Oaks .
__label__noemo	What about the cotton one ?
__label__joy	Dora , are you interested in going to the museum with me tomorrow ? I read the newspaper this morning . I know there is an art exhibition in Taipei Modern Art Museum .
__label__joy	They ’ re nice .
__label__noemo	I need you to take a look at these samples . I think there are a few problems .
__label__noemo	Are you being served , sir ?
__label__joy	sure , here you are .
__label__noemo	Maybe I'll run away first .
__label__noemo	Will that be all ?
__label__noemo	I don't know . I never went to a church before . I was not raised as a Christian , so I don't know what to do .
__label__noemo	When ? Tomorrow morning ?
__label__noemo	But you have already worked there for five years .
__label__noemo	Soup and bread and salad bar ! I'm telling you , these people know how to keep you coming back !
__label__noemo	I'm from Canada .
__label__noemo	It was hard at the beginning , but now feel it's really relaxing . It makes me flexible .
__label__noemo	Mark , you are not telling me the truth . Now why ?
__label__noemo	Ok . Let's go right after dinner .
__label__noemo	For what time , sir ?
__label__noemo	Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy.She is always making us kids eat the proper foods .
__label__noemo	Surely , there are other ways to save money .
__label__noemo	We'd better ask dad first .
__label__noemo	Are you really interested in doing something ?
__label__joy	Thank you very much , Mr Green .
__label__noemo	No , I didn ’ t hear about that .
__label__joy	Thank you . Have a nice day .
__label__noemo	I ’ d like to make a reservation for my trip from Detroit to Beijing on April 13 on Trans Pacific Airline .
__label__noemo	Mom , will you have time to help me with my homework today ?
__label__disgust	I must admit I'm not at all interested in math .
__label__noemo	Ok . may I ask what is the reason for returning these products ?
__label__noemo	Certainly !
__label__noemo	Could I also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
__label__noemo	What do you think of the play showed last night ?
__label__noemo	OK . I am coming .
__label__sadness	Only sometimes when I think about it , I feel very sad .
__label__noemo	why ? Did tom pop the question ?
__label__noemo	Welcome to Flower Power , sir . What can I get for you ?
__label__noemo	I'll buy it later on today .
__label__noemo	If I were you , I would put the whole matter on the table .
__label__noemo	we've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger .
__label__noemo	Will traveling be required in this position ?
__label__joy	Then I'll see you at six . Is that all right ?
__label__noemo	He is a bootlicker . I suppose that is because he is quick on the uptake .
__label__noemo	Is it very far from here ?
__label__sadness	Okay , I'll be right back ... Congratulations ! The manager approved the final price $ 15,000 .
__label__joy	Hi ! Peter . How are you ?
__label__noemo	Yes . I urgently need a room for tomorrow night , and do you have any vacancies ?
__label__noemo	On Wednesday , you are going to London . Don't forget your train leaves at 9.30 am .
__label__noemo	I see . I guess I should be more careful about what I read , especially on the Internet where you have no idea who anybody is .
__label__noemo	What do you base our grades on ?
__label__noemo	Okay . Then I recommend this one . It's made especially for men about your age .
__label__noemo	Can I have the check please ?
__label__noemo	I am afraid I have some bad news for you . It's about our order contract O5TSWAL .
__label__joy	That's very kind of you . Thank you . Er ... have you got a pencil ?
__label__noemo	Please type it in a formal style .
__label__noemo	I agree , but I like wire frames .
__label__joy	that ’ s such great news . I ’ m really happy for you ! Where is your office located ?
__label__noemo	What shall we do tonight ?
__label__noemo	Thank you for pointing that out . I mistakenly gave you your friend's breakfast .
__label__noemo	This is Sue from work .
__label__noemo	Well , that's not far away .
__label__noemo	Thanks . Are you satisfied with your stay here with us , sir ?
__label__noemo	Well , to be frank , yes , I do .
__label__noemo	You can stay if you catch up and stay caught up . Otherwise , I will find another renter .
__label__joy	Then our entire job could be done by telecommuting .
__label__joy	It's very impressive . Can you use the Internet on your phone ?
__label__noemo	Did you do you own stunts in the movie ?
__label__noemo	Oh yes . I ’ Ve got it written down here . Just a minute .
__label__noemo	Yes , I do .
__label__joy	Thank God ! I am finished writing that service guide ! It took me forever !
__label__noemo	We appreciate your good intention and your effort in pushing the sale of our slippers . As you know , the demand for this item in your market is quite substantial . However , according to our records , the total amount of your order last year was moderate , which does not warrant an agency appointment . Unless you increase the turnover we can hardly appoint you our sole agent .
__label__noemo	Could you tell me some of entrees about the dinner ?
__label__noemo	Let me see them . Yes . There ’ re ok .
__label__noemo	What kind of things do you paint ?
__label__noemo	Ok .
__label__noemo	For about a month .
__label__joy	You're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me !
__label__noemo	You know me ; I'm always studying !
__label__noemo	I'll look up the rate.To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof.It means to search for and find some information .
__label__noemo	Guess again , Dave . I have no intention of leaving invoking . Never did .
__label__noemo	I like landscapes and still life . You prefer abstract paintings , don ’ t you ?
__label__noemo	Well , what about violet ? It means the eternal beauty .
__label__noemo	Maybe I have an idea how it happened .
__label__noemo	That ’ s it ?
__label__noemo	Well , he ’ s really lucky . It seems that he could win the bet at every turn .
__label__noemo	What deliveries are you quoting nowadays on orders such as ours ?
__label__noemo	The tall one ? Sure , that's Drive , he works with Lily .
__label__noemo	Let me affirm this again - the first shipment of 1,000 cases , to be delivered in 27 days , by June 30 , and the second shipment of 2,000 cases by August 15 . Right ?
__label__noemo	Oh , Never mind , I finished my paper.So you can use it tonight .
__label__noemo	Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ?
